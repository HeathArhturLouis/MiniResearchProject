 The science chapters get longer and duller and will cure most insomnias. The Diskworld story chapters get shorter and thinner and don't add up to even an Ok short Watch story. I appreciate what this series of books is trying to do, but please Mr. Pratchett, let it go. I've been a Diskworld fan for years and I'm sad to say that I've watched the humor dry out from book to book. Thud! was boring, mostly unfunny, and barely insightful in a politically-correct-why-can't-we-all-just-get-along way, but this one is worse. Even hard-core Pratchett junkies should take a pass on it. 
 While this book presents itself as a "behind the scenes" accounting of the drug companies -- there are several factors that made me very skeptical while reading it.  First off, I am not someone associated with the pharm companies and I've never received any money from them.  However, being someone in the medical field, I was immediately concerned when Dr. Healy states  on numerous occasions that SSRI's have conclusively been proven to *cause* suicidial thoughts.  Anyone in science knows the danger of stating causation.  The truth is, we don't know why SSRI's are *associated* with some increased suicidial ideation.  Furthermore, Dr. Healy completely negelects recent finds that SSRI's are associated with increased BDNF levels, which strongly suggest that high 5HT levels result in neuronal growth.  This one sided treatment of the issue becomes apparent in this book as the author slowly emerges as someone who has a personal axe to grind and, frankly, appears to be a hired-gun for the plantiff's bar.  He essentially states that SSRI's are *worse* than placebo for treating depression and that patient's who take them are too stupid to know the difference between placebo and effective treatment.  Unfortunately, these factors cast serious doubts on the entirelty of this work.   Pass it by as polemics. 
 Here is a synopsis of the book so you may spend your money elsewhere:  1) Don't diet 2) Get used to your "new" menopausal figure--ie. learn to love it. 3) Exercise 4 times a week for at least an hour so you feel better--but don't expect miracles in the weight-loss department. Well. duh!  I really felt the book rambled on about the obvious and in the end, I just ended up feeling depressed.  What the book did manage to do was to thoroughly explain the biological process of why your body is changing.  That, I already knew!  
 This book doesn't include any text about stairs. I guess most complete homes don't need stairs. I find this book more of a coffee table book than a book I can count on for howto information 
 It's about time for someone to make a strong pitch to Hollywood for a new version of "Fahrenehit 451".  Although I appreciate what Truffault was trying to accomplish back in the sixties, the movie just does not hold up well in 2007, particularly when shown in a high school classroom.  Advancements in CGI could transform Bradbury's novel into a very frightening and exciting thriller.  My students spent more time laughing at the adaptation than appreciating it thematically.  That being said, the book gained value exponentially to them because the movie didn't satisfy their understanding.  Lose the wires on the jet packs! 
 I bought this album purely because it has Kool Keiths name on it, what a mistake besides the Reverand Tom intro the album is garbage. Keith isnt on 2/3rds of the album. And my white sister could rhyme better than the chick on this album. Just stay away, if you want some decent worth while Kool Keith check out, Dr Dooom, Octo, Diesel Truckers or Black Elvis 
 30+ years after Jimi's death this author jumps to the head of the (very long) line of Hendrix biographers who claim to have the "true" story behind/about the man and the musician . . . and like so many previous biographies this one falls woefully short. What you will find in this book - an interesting narrative on Hendrix's childhood, a perspective on Hendrix's heroin possession trial in Canada, a brief chronology of The Experience's 1966-67 rise to stardom, a "theory" on his death and A LOT of the stereotypical tortured artist trapped in a web of managers, lawyers, promoters and hangers-on. What you won't find in this book - any serious discussion, analysis, description or even a glimpse of Hendrix's music - a fairly extraordinary feat for a Hendrix biography. Quotation marks are used very liberally throughout this book and I'll leave it to someone else to discuss/verify the authenticity of the remarks and sources - I'll simply say the "conversations" proved incredibly uninteresting to this reader - again somewhat remarkable when you consider the subject matter. The last section of the book concerns all the financial/legal issues concerning Hendrix's music since his death. As a long time fan I've "experienced" the re-issues, bootlegs, dub-overs etc.,(and long ago realized that these releases had more to do with money than with the music), and I guess I've been peripherally aware of the legal battles, but at this point in time as long as the Hendrix audio library stays available with an occasional addition here and there I'm happy, so the in-fighting chronicled here, (as pathetic and petty as it was/is), was of somewhat less interest to me... and also paints the author in a similar light. Unfortunately, as it was 40 years ago, Jimi has many admirers/fans but very few if any friends.  
 A friend recommended this book to me, so I picked it up.  From the start, I had to force myself to keep going.  I read the whole book, but I wouldn't recommend it 
 You get a view into 60's white america. The only people of color in this book are a policeman, and a caricature. I don't have a problem with other Seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe. This is set in everyday life, and I think its best left on the bookshelf, it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair, not to mention various shades of skin colour. The rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one-dimensional "white" depiction of the world 
 If you're looking for balanced, cool-headed, well-argued case against Social Security reform, this is not your book. If you want a partisan diatribe that is about as worthwhile as the anti-Social Security "propaganda" that Mr. Skidmore describes, then you've found your  tome. (Curiously, in the author's narrative "propaganda" suddenly  becomes skillful or ingenious "rhetoric" when its used in support  of Social Security; never mind that the program has functioned like a  multi-billion dollar campaign fund for the Democrats). This book is  essentially an elaborate ad hominem attack against anybody who would dare  question the sustainability of current entitlement spending on the elderly.  The author attributes all reform proposals to the right-wing; never mind  that several respectable individuals whom no one would call reactionary,  including Brookings economist Henry Aaron, former CBO director Robert  Reischauer, former SSA chief actuary Robert Myers, and Urban Institute  senior fellow Eugene Steuerle have also suggested reasonable,  non-privatization proposals to slow the rate of entitlement spending.  Skidmore's arguments against any reform are poorly constructed and rely on  a very narrow range of evidence and expertise. He offers straw man  refutations such as a cranky letter from an Auburn professor in USA Today,  of all places, that is hardly representative of mainstream thought. There  are truly bizarre counterarguments: he suggests that projections of  increasing life expectancy must be bunk because the human race is not  immortal. There are downright falsehoods: he claims that the  "relevant" number concerning welfare state spending is the total  dependent population--ignoring the fact that the average elderly dependent  costs far more money than the average child dependent, and that money spent  on the latter is an investment in a future worker while supporting the  former only contributes to consumption. The author is also either  completely ignorant or disingenuous when he discusses the program's  financing. Like many of those who claim a "crisis" in the system,  Skidmore misleadingly focuses on the program's long-term "trust  fund" balance. Even if the economy will do far better than is  projected, as he argues, Social Security will eventually not be able to  support itself on payroll taxes alone and it will have to redeem its  "assets"--translated, this means that general taxpayer revenue  will be necessary to subsidize benefits, increasing what current workers  are paying into the system. He is correct to state that the increase in  Social Security spending will be only 1-2% of GDP, but Medicare will add  much more to that and the real concern is entitlement spending as a  percentage of the federal budget. There is legitimate concern that general  revenue transfers to entitlements plus interest expenses will crowd out  funds for everything else--from education to infrastructure to defense to  programs for the non-elderly poor. Skidmore makes the downright silly  argument that we should just hike up the interest rates on the bonds that  Social Security holds--where the hell does he think this money is coming  from? As the late Herb Stein mused, we could simply "credit"  Social Security with the money to pay benefits for the next trillion years  if we wanted to, but this would simply be an accounting gimmick. Yet this  is what Skidmore endorses when he enthuses over Clinton's "plan"  to "save" Social Security by shifting debt even further down the  timeline. Predictably, Skidmore says that if trouble should arise, we  should simply raise taxes (in his eyes, raising the retirement age is a  dastardly benefit cut). In his glorified history of the program, Skidmore  doesn't bother to mention how Democratic Congresses routinely ignored  scheduled payroll tax increases and instead continued to hike up  benefits--thereby increasing the level of payments that are considered  necessary. Research, such as that done by Daniel Radner (1993) and Michael  Hurd (1989) show that the elderly are at least as well off as the rest of  the population, even though the elderly poor generally have no means to  escape their poverty. Yet Skidmore dismisses the idea of targeting relief  to this group, instead relying on the liberal shibboleth that attributes  Social Security's political success to its "incorporation" of the  middle class, which is really just a roundabout way of saying that people  tend to like the government when the government sends them checks. (He also  conveniently fails to discuss that the program's political support revolves  around a few carefully promoted fictions--see the Rothstein article in  reference below). Social Security and Medicare have been successful in  helping lots of people, there's no doubt about that. But we should not  ignore the fact that the program was created in different time for a  different world, and has grown into something far larger than what was  originally contemplated. Longer life spans, less working years, greater  health--these are all things to be happy about, but they also signify a new  reality that books like this one will not help us to understand. Far better  books on the subject include Aaron & Reischauer's Countdown to Reform,  or Steuerle's Retooling Social Security for the 21st Century. Even if  you're skeptical of privatization, as I am, see the work of Martin  Feldstein or William Beach of the Heritage Foundation (Beach's plan DOES  account for disability, and he has answered critics of his methodology). I  found this book repeatedly frustrating, even maddening at times, for the  author's intransigence and even dishonesty on several issues--a for more  earnest discussion of the liberal standpoint is Richard Rothstein's  "When We Practice to Deceive" in Dissent (Fall 99). In sum, this book is alternately dim-witted,  disingenuous, omissive, and petty. It's hard to believe that a supposedly  reputable academic could put out such an unillimunating piece of tripe like  this. This is one of the worst books on public policy that I have ever  read 
 I can honestly say that I have almost always finished reading a book that I start.  This is the exception.  It's my fault, really.  I was looking for a book that would discuss the origins and development of Halloween.  I had in mind the sort that would discuss Charlie Brown and The Great Pumpkin and other Americana.  You know, a nostalgic trip down Memory Lane in rural/suburban America.  Oops.  This is actually an academic treatise where the author wants to discuss social inversion, gender identity, and queer politics.  No offense to the author, but most people don't regularly use the term "social inversion", let alone bring it up constantly in conversation.  If you are a cultural transgressor looking to be affirmed in your okayness, this is perhaps a good book for you.  I was looking to be affirmed in my nostalgia, so I am out of luck.  (Normally I don't review books down because I disagree with the author; however, I feel that this is marketed deceptively.  Normal people don't talk like this guy writes, so I can only imagine that he is one of those people that must rework every concept to fit his sociological theories.  Or maybe I'm just a jerk - you decide) 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters

 Are we living in the end times is just what I expected.  Typical apologetic Christian scare tactics based on irrational fantasies. What should scare you is the nastiness of the previous "Christian" reviewers attitudes toward each other.  A person whom may be interested in the Christian worldview likely would be even more confused and probably put off by these people.  Why should they bother to read Mr. LaHaye's opinions or for that matter the Bible itself, since all these people have read these same books and come to such different interpretations  and conclusions.  If they're looking for love and comfort, why should they want to join a group of people that not only look forward to the world being destroyed and 80 percent of the nice people inhabiting it to be murdered and tortured forever, but also seem to hate people of their own faith?      Christians have such diverse opinions because the fact is that the Bible is hopelessly contradictory, no matter how hard apologists like LaHaye try to twist and destort its words to make it form to their own biases.  By all means, READ the New Testament.  Take your time, don't use study guides that try to tell you what they think it means, keep an open mind and THINK FOR YOURSELF. You will find that there is no question that the people writting the New Testament thought that the "end of the world" was going to happen in thier lifetimes.  Pay attention to Matt. 24 when Jesus says he will be back during that generation, or Matt. 16 where people standing there will not have drawn thier last breath before the second coming occurs.  You don't use terms like "the time is nigh", "the end of all things is at hand" or the first words of Revelations itself " the things which MUST SHORTLY come to pass" if you think it might take a couple of thousand years.  When the Bible says the world is flat, the sky is a solid dome supported by pillars with windows in it for the rain, space is full of water, and that giant human/angels used to inhabit the earth, it is wrong.  When it says that invisible people who live in the sky are going to come and destroy the earth and just about everybody in it, that again is wrong. More importantly, it is not moral or anything close to love, which the religious are always claiming they have so much of.       Don't wait for someone to come do some magic and make all your problems go away. Get off your knees and do it yourself. 
 I could not get enough vacuum to draw the oil from the crankcase... unit would not work.  I am very dissatisfied with the product 
 The John Carter of Mars series of books, by my favorite author of all time,   Edgar Rice Burroughs,  is his best series. I was so excited to receive the audio version of this book, but when I listened to it, I was hoorified !    John Carter sounded like a wimp.  A girly Southerner, not at all the swashbuckling hero I envisioned.   Now, maybe I'm spoiled by the narrators of other books, but even the weakest, most boring readings have not turned me off in the way that John Bolen has.   Please Tantor audio,  get some one else to read this, and make sure it is a Manly-Man ! 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. The author seems more interested in self promotion and only scrathes the surface of the subject matter. In my opinion not worth the money. 
 My initital impressions of 'American Gods' were nearly uniformly positive.  Although I had not read any reviews previous, I was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel.  But like a doomed traveler in Fred Pohl's 'Gateway', the book never achieved "turn-a-round".  The central storyline is further and further pushed off, and often seems to occur on the sidelines.  Gaiman's prose is engaging and easy to slip into, but I felt empty in the end, without significant payoff or a true sense of journey.  Those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by Tim Powers.  "Last Call" in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to "Gods 
 Contents are low and false. Example, the book tells Vacheron Constantin is founded by Francois Constantin 1755, when it was  Jean-Marc Vacheron. Charles Constatin entered the firm 1819(!). Lousy pics of uninteresting watches. It's now in the dustbin, where it belongs. Beware! 
 I have been in Technical analysis for more than 4 years and have many books on the subject but of all the books I have "The Encyclopedia of Technical Market Indicators" is the most misguided title ever. Motivation for this statement is that the book is almost like an empty vessel. The author relates to numerous indicators and indicates how successful or unsuccessful they are but without explanations which make it difficult to comprehend. Also nowhere in the book does he indicate how these indicators should be used which, in my opinion, should be the essence of a book with this title. The author attempts to correct this on his website at: www.robertwcolby.com 
 "Good morning class.  Today we are going to learn about a trillion different kinds of rocks.  Now the softest rock on the Mohs scale is talc...  The hardest rock is diamond."  At this point in time I am snoring really loudly on my desk and dreaming about the second I get out of the class.  Annie Dillard, you have just been the teacher of that class.  You taught me all about rocks, jokes, dancing, and rebellion.  All of this stuff I either know about or don't care about.    This book provokes a lot of emotions in me - emotions that can otherwise only be felt when a family member has died.  Just to look at this book brings my eyes so much pain that, if I look at it again, I will most definitely go blind.  Writing this review has really made me learn to appreciate good books, and to never take books at face value.  I have read some reviews on this book and many of them hailed it as "amazing".  Never in the course of my life will I ever believe a review on anything to do with culture.  This book gave me a prophetic epiphany and, seeing as I am an atheist, I do not normally get those.  During my sleep a demon came to me and shoved this book into my face.  In the night, I woke up with a searing pain in my head that would not go away for hours and my vision has been slightly impaired since.  This is no joke.  I am sure there is a psychological explanation for this, but whenever I pick up the book I get a feeling of nausea.  The book lacks cohesion, but many other reviewers have already commented on this (so I don't have to).  There is, however, one cohesive element to this book, and that is the title "An American Childhood".  If you do not get a sense that this is a boring book just from the title then you have some incurable issues.  The title describes a childhood in America, and since this book is mostly published in America, many people can relate to it too closely, which takes away the purpose of this book.  Annie Dillard was a normal child so she wrote a normal book.  However, the consumers of the world are not looking for an average product; they are looking for exceptional work.  I am sorry Mrs. Dillard, but this book is normal, you are normal, so that is why you only have a normal average from amazon.com reviewers 
 This is the worst thing.  Never buy this one!!! There is serious noise,big problem.. 
 overall, not helpfull.There are some interesting tools in the addendum, the author gets pretty weighty with them however.The most usefull point, parents will probably have to create their own learning plan and Rogers shares some examples of those 
 Michael burned up an the doc blew up in Halloween 2, end of story, end of franchise. Money hungry producers and writers need to get a brain and think of something new. The mask is even horrible in this so called film. Rest in peace Mr Plesance, I hope God let you through the pearly gates after making such horrible sequels. Currently Rob Zombie is remaking the original Halloween, what a travisty. What next, Alice Cooper remaking Jaws or Ted Nugent remaking The Godfather. Leave classics alone 
 This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read (listened to).  I was never able to find a plot, and even though no one ever had sex in the book, everyone was always thinking about it and wanting to.  Not very realistic.  And, sorry, Jonathan Morosz, but the narration couldn't have gotten any more monotone 
 I am still awaiting resolution of a problem I have with these drives. In writing DVDs I get verification errors. This proboem arises if the drives are used in an external firewire enclosure. The drive works fine if internal in your computer attached to the IDE bus, but there is an issue if attached to your computer by firewire 
 I love the shows, but a favorites DVD with only three episodes?  I couldn't believe it.  The three shows would get 5 stars, but the great ones that are missing bring my review down to 2 stars 
 This is not music. Have some respect. If you like this you are probably an idiot jock who thinks the middle east is somewhere near Kansas. Please America, wake up. 
 The Covert-One series, written by a variety of authors, unfortunately does not live up to Ludlum's standards. Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.  The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other. In the middle of the book somewhere, it all comes together leading to a high-testoterone (but somewhat unbelievable) climax 
 Because of the infinite complexity of human behavior, attempts to explain it are almost wholly speculative - especially when the subject is as complex as war.  With no nod to that reality, Mr. Hanson unimaginatively adopts the popular myths of the ideological right to explain what he believes has been an unbroken history of Western military dominance.  Some of the reasons that he offers are capitalism, freedom, and individualism.  He should be writing political speeches, not history.  His theories are just plain silly.    If you can skim through the countless repetitive passages, much of his descriptive material is, however, interesting 
 I just wanted to give an update on my progress.  I cannot, with good conscience, support Diane's program any longer.  I am currently weight training, doing cardio, and eating healthy.  Eating healthy is not eating whatever you want.  In 12 weeks, I brought my risk factor for heart disease down from 5.9:1 (which is horrible) to around 3 (which is nonexistent risk).  I did it with exercise and eating right.  I also lost two sizes with just a 12 pound scale loss because I was gaining muscle, too.  To be healthy, you have to work at it!  Sure, you can lose weight eating whatever you want if you eat less - at least up to a point.  But who wants to be a skinny fat woman or a skinny fat man?  Wouldn't you rather be healthy and have a fabulous physique?  Try Body for Life by Bill Phillips.  Also check out the www.bodybuilding.com website for inspiration, education, and good products 
 I haven't read this thing, nor would I care to.  However, it has nonetheless had a profound (negative) influence in my life.  It seems that someone was "inspired" by this thing to make bizarre advances on someone I know.  Normally, I wouldn't care, but this person ended up suspecting me of doing it! Having glanced over the opening lines of this nauseating garbage, I'm highly offended that anyone would think I would read it, let alone act like an idiot because of it. What has become apparent to me is that readers of this sort of new age drivel are highly imbalanced and confused individuals, and potentially dangerous! I urge anyone of sound mind to avoid this book like the plague, and be wary of anyone who reads this sort of thing 
 Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
 Have purchased the 5 QT version of this Dutch Oven. During the second use of it, the bottom layer developed a bubble, separated from there, making this utensil totally useless. I am now trying out the warranty and see if there really is an exchange for it 
 No new information here.  Presented in a manner that is very dull and uninteresting.  Save your money!  There are many options that are much better 
 I saw the show on stage.  I saw most of the original productions that are reprised in this.  Unfortunately, this is Ann Reinking's version of Bob Fosse.  Reinking is a great performer who was considered the quintessential Fosse dancer of the 70's and 80's created this tribute.  The difference is Ann Reinking has taken the Fosse style and utilized this to create a style of her own.  As a tribute to Fosse this is inaccurate.  Therefore, for Fosse aficiandos this is not an acurate recreation but an interpretation of his works.  Also, there is a too big reliance on his concept musical "Dancin'".  The one good thing in this is the addition of another Fosse creation Ben Vereen.  He shows why he can still pack a house.  My suggestion is to rent Fosse films like Sweet Charity and All that Jazz.  You'll get to see the real Fosse 
 Argh - hoping to find a good survey of the geologic processes behind the Earth we know today but written for a non-geologist, I found his writing unfocused, tortured and pedantic -especially for someone who claimed to be targeting the geological neophyte.  Just ghastly and dry.  I suspect Mr Fortey's editor was handing out bonuses for using words that only 1 in 3 Phds had any chance of recognizing.  Mr Fortey must have picked up enough money on this incentive for a nice gourmet dinner.  This is an easy book to set aside. Just pick up a college geology text book and you will be better off 
 I purchased this book specifically to make the quilt, 'La Chocolata'. Having just begun to assemble this quilt, I have found the cutting directions both incomplete and inaccurate.  As an experienced quilter, I'll be able to correct the errors and figure out the size for the corner triangles, but I shouldn't have to do that. 
  Alas, I only made it to page 157 so perhaps I shouldn't even be allowed to comment but I was so tired of the wishy washy main character who could rain so much misery on her own life I couldn't go on another page. I loved Rule of the Bone, it's one of my favorite books but this one left me cold. 
 The casting director should have spared us the bow to diversity and political correctness when a hispanic was cast as France and a negro as Burgundy. Set design and costume sacrificed tradition and historical representation to economy and off-beat originality. The costumes resemble those of Star Wars. The Fool, instead of being youthful, agile and entertaining, is fat, old and dumpy. The most entertaining thing about the fool is Lear referring to the grizzled 70 year-old as "boy". Holms as Lear can't hold a candle to Lawrence Oliver. Holms plays every scene with the same, monotonous, high level of intensity, like a manic Lear. He is unable to play Lear as a likeable, sympathetic character, in any scene. During the scene in which Lear's heart is supposed to break when Cordelia fails to declare her love with sufficient eloquence, Holms' Lear only comes accross as manic, obsessed and neurotic. Even with its poor film quality, Sir Lawrence Oliver's production is the best 
 The emotional exaggeration and vitriolic attacks are so great readers will have a difficult time trusting the author's research and writing. Hanegraaff's diatribe should be ignored 
 I have a lot of trouble to get through this book: to me it is just a long list of "grand" statements and visions being poned without much of a logic structure. Well, I guess it is a good thing many people are inspired by it. Maybe I am too much a male, or too Dutch (van dik hout.. 
 Considering the size of the book I was disappointed in the lack of information and meanings given. They are mostly one word meanings, if there is a meaning at all. Mostly it seems like it wants to take you in a big circle of reference from one name to the next never quite giving you what you are looking for. It wasn't helpful for me. I found "The Babyname Wizard" book A LOT more informative and helpful 
 I have no idea where Warner dredged up these desperate, anxiety ridden mommies fretting over Baby Einstein and private schools. As a stay home mom, by choice, I resent the implication that all women who choose to stay home are mired in a unfulfilled tedious life. And as far as these crazy women running themselves ragged - Ladies, you made a CHOICE to book your kids into a gazillion activities. My children are at their most creative with a few blankets, the kitchen table and some cardboards boxes. Remember making kitchen table forts on rainy days? And I am pretty well convinced neither of my kids are going to end up mentally impaired, at the bottom of their class or having their college admission applications rejected because I wasn't tutoring them in conversational Japanese rather than coloring in a color book together each afternoon. And if the childcare system/motherhood support system is so great in France, then move back to France! Encouraging the US government to provide some pie in the sky support is naive and short sighted. Instead, look to cultivating your community and embracing your neighbors as friends and helpmates rather than competition. Making true connection with others in community is a rare and splendid thing. Here on planet Earth, despite the anxious paranoid feeling we are all supposed to be feeling, the Joneses don't give a hang if we drive a Mercedes and they  really aren't out to get us 
 Despite efforts by other reviewers to puff this book, there's little information to be gained. Looking at the comic book cover, the sensationalistic back jacket, and cover to cover of unverified accusations, this book was tailor-made for conspiracy buffs. For example, they want you to believe that 15 years ago microchips were being injected into the bloodstream to reach the brain for the purpose of mind control. Never mind that 15 years ago wafer fabs capable of manufacturing such chips don't, and still do not, exist - oh, that's right, the government is covering them up!  This book has examples of criminals who, when arrested, claimed that the government was injecting voices in their heads. What the author seems to have left out is that claiming to hear voices is the first step in a defendant's PRETENSE of an insanity defense! Yeah, this author leaves a lot out.  But never mind, the facts make no difference to conspiricy fanatics, do they?  Stay away from this book unless you like it piled high and really smelly. 
 Parker Palmer has a fan club.  I say this in a positive sense, because people I respect speak very favorably about Palmer and his writings.  My entire world view of him consists of these comments and the contents of this book, Let Your Life Speak.  I feel I have some points of common reference to help me understand the text and its message: UC Berkeley, service, the Society of Friends, clearness committees, teaching, and higher education.  It's just that Palmer weaves this tapestry into a pattern that speaks to him, and not to me.  And sometimes I'm simply not sure what he IS weaving (or what language he is speaking): "The knowledge I am talking about is not intellectual and analytical but integrative and of the heart, and the choices that lead to wholeness are not pragmatic and calculated, intended to achieve some goal, but simply and profoundly expressive of personal truth" (p. 60).  What does this mean?  The book is full of these hybrid poetry/narrative comments.  And Palmer seems to not like himself, suggesting pain as an honorable and effective method for discovering one's true self:  "That concept of vocation is rooted in a deep distrust of selfhood, in the belief that the sinful self will always be "selfish" unless corrected by external forces of virtue... Today I understand vocation quite differently -- not as a goal to be achieved but as a gift to be received" (p. 10).  "But before we come to that center, full of light, we must travel in the dark" (p. 18).  "The God I know does not ask us to conform to some abstract norm for the ideal self.  God asks us only to honor our created nature, which means our limits as well as potentials.  When we fail to do so, reality happens -- God happens -- and way closes behind us" (p. 50).  "When I was finally able to turn around and ask, 'What do you want?' the answer was clear: I want you to embrace this descent into hell as a journey toward selfhood -- and a journey toward God" (p. 69).  "Midway in my life's journey, "way closed" again, this time with a ferocity that felt fatal: I found myself in the dark woods called clinical depression, a total eclipse of light and hope.  But after I emerged from my sojourn in the dark and had given myself several years to absorb its meaning, I saw how pivotal that passage had been on my pilgrimage toward selfhood and vocation" (p. 56-7).  "If we, as leaders, are to cast less shadow and more light, we need to ride certain monsters all the way down, explore the shadows they create, and experience the transformation that can come as we 'get into' our spiritual lives" (p. 85).   Parker Palmer discusses his life.  In no way is this book a guide to "let your life speak."  It is his path, a path that, frankly, I hope most of humanity can avoid.  I am glad for Palmer that he found his way, and his vocation.  It is good, and appropriate, that he has his heros.  But there are many paths, and many avoid clinical depression.  Many involve families.  Many separate their vocation from their life.  And yet there is his reputation!  What have I missed in this little book 
 The author does a decent job explaining ISO requirements.  Contrary to the other reviewer's claims, there are "no" examples in the book.  Another useful tool would have been examples of ISO systems / process flowchart.  Instead, the author tries to get you to buy his software if you want to see any example at all.  I give the book 2 stars because it tries to do marketing instead of doing it's job of giving buyers useful information.  Based on the title of the book "ISO 9001 Requirements", the author did do his job explaining what the requirements are.  However, if you want to do ISO in order to improve the quality system of your company, as opposed to just getting a piece of paper saying that your company is ISO certified, then look for another book 
 Now, I love to read. It's extremely RARE for me to pick up a book and not finish it. I'm not a picky reader, either. I like just about anything that I get my hands on. But this book--this book was an exception.  It's not so much of the cute cover (I really liked it) or the initial plot of the book. It's the bland writing and how unrealistic everything is. I only got through about half of the book, but I had to put it down. The way the writers (it's two people using one pseudonym) wrote the story, it had me thinking about other things. I had to go back and reread passages because even though I had "read" them, my mind had wandered.   I'm all one for romance, and I have read a lot of these types of books. But Cy and Morgan's romance... it just happened out of nowhere. There was no build up. Also, I felt the characters lacked any dimension whatsoever and the whole book had me feeling like, "So what?"  A book is only good if it makes its readers care, one way or another. And I honestly didn't care. Which is why I gave this book 1 star 
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 Thsi book is for someone who has an extense knowledge of the Byzantine empire. I do not posses such knowledge and got lost inmediatly while trying to read this book. The author's style adapts for someone who knows all the history of the people involved in this empire already. I couldn't even finish the first chapter because I found myself asking: who is he talking about? every two  lines 
 Just about the most useLESS book I have ever bought.  The coverage is way too broad and general. There are little to NO specific areas covered. Just general information that can be obtained in the owners manual that comes with the vehicle. All in all, not even worth taking to the throne room. 
 Harder to get into than I first thought.  The kids are anxious to get to "work" and fidget getting into this, the arms are a bit too tight.  It seems bulky as well.  Better off going old school - daddy's old shirt on backwards 
 All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over.  
 There are instances where the translator includes things which Ibn Ishaq had not written about, and he does not, as mentioned earlier by someone, clearly demaricate this.  For example, the entire section about the Satanic verses is no where to be found in the original Arabic work, yet it somehow is in the English "translation".  There are other such descrepancies, so the reader should know that some of what he/she might be seeing is external to what Ibn Ishaq wrote 
 I'd love to write a review about the movie, unfortunately, after many install and reboot, I could not download it! Customer support was not helpful and blamed my DSL connection. I have downloaded movies from iTunes and MovieLink and never had problems before, so the explanation did not really resonate with me. Don't use this service.. 
 Anyone who keeps track of the sectarian fringes of Protestantism knows that James R. White and Dave Hunt are probably not on each other's Christmas card lists this year. These two Protestant apologists, most known for their vehement opposition to anything that smells of Rome, have of late been aiming their guns at each other in a heated debate over which of them is the least Catholic.  It all began a few years ago when Dave Hunt discovered Calvinism. Having ignored the first half-millenia or so of its existence, he quickly saw it as thinly disguised popery and immediately condemned this latest attempt by Rome at perverting the faith. White, a Reformed Baptist with impeccable five-point Calvinist credentials, was understandably miffed that someone might think of themselves as more Protestant than he and quickly responded. This led to one of the most unintentionally funny radio sequences ever aired. White had invited Hunt to be ambushed...I mean interviewed...on his radio program and he quickly set out to prove he was truer to the principles of the Protestant Reformation. Hunt replied to pointed questions on the writings of Luther and Calvin by admitting that he had never actually read them. It was one of the few times in memory that White was, if for only a few seconds, left speechless.  After the interview, Hunt went on to write a book condemning Calvinism. This might be surprising considering he didn't know much about Calvin, but ignorance of a topic has never been a hindrance for Hunt. White's critiques of Hunt increased and this led to the publication of Debating Calvinism, a joint book written in a debate format. In this heated exchange, Hunt accuses White of backing crypto-papist sacramentalism while White responds by charging Hunt with diluting the Gospel with Catholic soteriology.  White sets his tone early by establishing the Calvinist mantra of the Sovereignty of God. While God certainly is sovereign, White - like many hardcore Calvinists - mistakenly believes that if one desires God to save him it is logically equivalent to man saving himself. God's sovereignty does not require man to be reduced to the level of an automoton. This is something the early Church understood and saw no contradiction in asserting both man's free will in time and God's election of the saints in eternity.  Hunt, for his part, gets in trouble early when tackling the topic of Church history. Recycling long discredited theories of fundamentalist successionism (Hunt cites E. H. Broadbent's woefully inaccurate The Pilgrim Church), he claims the dualist Albighensians and other heretical groups as proto-fundamentalists just to avoid paying any historic debt to the Reformation. This illustrates his inadequacy as a researcher: In all his discourse, he builds his case upon unreliable secondary sources whose major qualification is agreeing with his erroneous assumptions. Even when quoting primary sources, it is largely quotes cited in the aforementioned secondary sources that misunderstand the intent of writers whose concept of the faith is far different and far more accurate than the populist American Christianity promoted by Hunt and his allies.  Although, as you might guess, I don't see eye-to-eye with much of what either man says, I can at least give White credit for making a coherent argument. Hunt is all over the place, rattling out accusations in a rambling and often caustic tone and spending much time on irrelevant points. For example, he goes into great length on Calvin's belief in the efficacy of infant baptism. Besides Hunt misunderstanding Calvin (and that Calvin was right and Hunt is wrong), you have the odd fact that White doesn't believe in infant baptism himself!! Obviously, if many Calvinists have not and do not practice infant baptism, it cannot be an essential of the movement. This is yet another example of Hunt's shoddy research.  In the end, their wrangling exposes the Achilles' heel of sectarian Protestantism. They may give lip service to Protestant unity around "the Gospel," but their gospels are incompatible. Furthermore, any alleged unity around the solas of the Reformation is illusory as their definitions of these are at odds. One need only look at White and Hunt argue over grace here to illustrate this point. To paraphrase the title of Hunt's anti-Calvinist book, what unity is this? The truth is the unity of the solas is one of vocabulary - not substance. The true unity of sectarian Protestantism is disdain for Rome and all things Catholic. There is almost an implicit agreement that you prove yourself right by proving your opponent Catholic.  Debating Calvinism is not useful as an evaluation of Calvinism but is a textbook example of the folly of sectarianism. Completely obsessed with their own private interpretations, Hunt and White are in a huff that some other guy might follow suit with his own private interpretations. Interesting as it may be into the workings of sectarianism, it cannot be recommended.   
 I wanted Erika Jo to win through the whole Nashville Star season, and was excited to buy her CD. But there are only about two good songs on it. On the CD, there aren't enough fast songs. I think there should be a good mix of fast and slow songs. There's one fast song and ten slow songs. They're ok songs, but it wasn't very enjoyable to listen to. I'm very disappointed because Erika Jo had such a good voice 
 My wife of ten years and me saw Brian on our first date in Providence RI he was amazing and holds a special place in my affections for that and other reasons, but this cd to me is a return to the lackluster ZZ Top/Sammy Hagar like songwriting of Nitro Burnin Funny Daddy. I totally understand wanting to stretch out of the rockabilly strait jacket some fans want to pin him in, but I think the man is more capable of the smart blues based americana rockabilly Springsteen and Dylan have explored than this stale arena rock like effort. Sorry, Brain I still love you man and will come out to your 2007 tour, just have to be honest that I really just can't dig this stuff 
 Normally I like Nora Roberts, but this book was a very tough read. Callie, the main character, was not likeable whatsoever. She was nasty throughout the entire book with a filthy mouth. She did not come across as strong or self-sufficient, just nasty. It was not entertaining, just tiresome. I started skimming towards the end because I just wanted to get through it.    The end was anti-clamatic, didn't really settle the issue of two sets of parents. The last few pages were practically identical to Three Fates, which, incidentally was a great read.         
 This novel is comprised of pretty, well constructed sentences.  That's about all it is.  Pretty, well constructed sentences.  The story itself could be interesting, after all it is a tale of multi-generational abandonment but it is told so dispassionately that it was difficult to remain interested, let alone awake.  The narrator, although the main character, was so far removed, emotionally, from her own telling of the story, that you wondered why she had bothered.    At time it seems that the writer was so enthralled with her own use of language that she seemed to forget that there was a story that needed to be told.  
 I purchased this item the middle of May.  It is now Oct. 1st and it won't heat up anymore!  Product should last longer than 5 months! 
 This book is all fluff and very little real information.  The language is cloying and takes away from any recipe that I would consider making.  Rachel shoud stick to TV where it's fun to watch her, and forget books unless she's writing kiddie books.  I am an accomplished cook and was hoping to find some easy, quick recipes.  Instead, I was annoyed by all the Cute Stuff 
 What a strange little book. Much is made of the fact that Stuart's parents - especially his mother - worries about him constantly, yet when he runs off to find his bird friend, he tells no one! And Stuart is obviously gay, not that there's anything wrong with that (I'm gay ... check out the illustration on page 31) He doesn't really want to date the girl, he's more interested in his canoe .. 
 This is an earnest if clumsily written book about redemption and believing in yourself.  The dialogue is wooden and the characters are completely one dimensional.  The author is trying to make a statement about caring for the environment, but it just ends up to be preachy and pedantic.  There are far better young adult fantasy series on the market, and I would not recommend this one 
 I was lucky enough not to buy this book, never feel specially draw into such matters as werewolf,but I didn't resist the temptation to browse it briefly at my local used bookstore,a lot of empty empty words,....   
 McCully 1  Adam McCully							                                                                                                         Instructor Lee Hobbs  ENGL 101.025  18 November 2005  Red Dragon  	When I heard that Universal Studios was making a prequel to Silence of the Lambs, I'll admit that I was a little skeptical.  Throughout movie history there has been a long list of bad sequels which, more or less, is what this prequel was.  Caddyshack II, Godfather III, and Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey, all horrible follow ups to great films.  So naturally I was a little worried that the film Red Dragon was going to be just another flop that followed a great film.  Any movie that follows a great film like Silence of the Lambs has a lot to live up to.  Personally, I thought that the first sequel to Silence of the Lambs,  Hannibal, didn't quite achieve that, and neither did Red Dragon.  It was a decent movie, but not quite as shocking and suspenseful as the first.  Don't get me wrong it did have its share of shock value, but since it didn't come first I had already come to expect that.  I thought that the writers would take the time and effort to make sure that this film was as good if not better than the first two films, but clearly their work shows otherwise. 	 All in all, this movie disappointed me for several reasons.  As I mentioned before, the lack of violence and shock that were so prevalent in the first movie and that I, as a fan of the films, had come to expect.  But mostly, it was the fact that this movie was nothing more than a film that was made in the eighties with a different title and better actors.  I've never been a fan of remakes and this film was certainly no exception.  
 It looks like a magazine rather than a book. Only few projects are nice but it's not worth it to pay $21 for those projects. The instructions aren't that clear and neither the graphs, I would not recommend it to anybody since there are much better books out there (e.g. The beaded garden - Diane Fitzgerald). I have seen many Russian books on beadings and there are much more interesting and worth to be translated.   
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 The title of this book would lead you to believe (or at least it led me to believe) that it is a supplement to other books on Windows 2000 and that it would provide guidance on the use of the unique features of the Professional Edition.  On the contrary, it is a plain vanilla manual on the use of the general features of Windows designed apparently for the novice who needs to be told how to open a file.  If this is what you are looking for, fine.  But if you want to learn how to use the real power of Windows 2000 Professional, you need to look further 
 this book reads very difficult and I cannot believe it is being prescribed to students.  My impression of the book is that the author took hordes of sentences and 'wisecracks' from dozens of other books and just threw them all together in order to create a book of his own. I think he didn't filter through the information to only use relevant stuff in order to get the message across.  He just threw in every bit and piece he could lay his eyes on.  It is really hard to read through a chapter - it feels the same as reading through a dictionary or telephone directory 
 I feel that "Soft Rain" doesn't depict the happenings of the Cherokee Trail of Tears very well.  I guess I was looking for more detail.  Don't buy this book unless it's for a child; this would be a good book for children 
 Unlike many of the reviewers here, I'm not a biblical expert and really don't care if the movie adheres to the stories as they are portrayed in the bible. I would just judge the movie based on its entertainment value and ability to engage me emotionally.  The biggest problem with this movie was that it simply seemed to be too long and drawn out. There were also some scenes that felt like padding and added nothing to the story (and in some cases detracted from it). For instance, during the long voyage while the earth was covered by water, everyone goes a bit crazy. That's an acceptable premise but it's played out theatrically for far too long and in a variety of embarrassing scenes for the actors. The idea that they suffered madness was fine to introduce but it shouldn't have taken up so much time nor been quite so adbsurdly plotted out like a little play.  There were also a couple of ridiculous encounters on the water (between Lot acting as a pirate and a merchant who sold them various trinkets for water) which undermined the entire story of the great flood. Everyone was supposed to have perished in the flood and it was a bit absurd that a few would be sailing the high seas on little boats. It was just plain silly and, again, seemed to be put in just to pad the story or add unnecessary "spice" (it didn't work as a means of jazzing up the story).  I'm guessing the writers felt the time on the water had to be long to show how Noah and his family suffered or had their faith tested but they also felt it had to be more interesting than just lounging on the boat and taking care of the animals. This type of insecurity with telling a story in the most effective way is what causes so many productions to go bad.  To the movie's credit, the actors are quite good and there are some good moments but too much of the movie doesn't work. 
 Butterfield is not a bad technician when it comes to playing the harmonica (assuming the accompanying CD is him).  There are several riffs that are very impressive and entertaining.  But when it comes to trying to provide the listener with instructions, he falls quite a bit short.    I found that he tends to speak in generalities and makes some assumptions that, had he clarified, would have added volumes to the listener's understanding.  I listened to the CD several times and never could find an instance where he actually indicates where he is about to start on the harmonica (4th hole draw, 6th hole blow, etc. . .)  It is this lack of clarification that I found very distracting, and often downright frustrating.  The turnaround riffs starting around track 45 are excellent.  But they require the student to have mastered bending.  A tough task for a newcomer.  He almost has a great teaching tool here -- but I was hoping for a little better than almost. .  
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 I picked this up because it's considered a classic and I knew it had been made into a movie.  I tend to think that if a book is made into a movie, then the book must be pretty good.  Not so with Howard's End.  The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige.  You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable.  None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world.  I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance.  The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later.  Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry.  There definately is an audience for this book.  I'm just not a part of it 
 I ordered my book. I moved. I contacted the seller, I contacted the seller, and again I contacted the seller. After three attempts, and after six weeks, the seller arranged a refund MINUS the shipping. Whose fault was this r-e-a-l-l-y......? I had no voice, and only get mass-mail answers in return. This seller is not good. I'd give them a zero if I could 
 Altough Yafa does include a few useful tidbits of information, his malice for and bias against the cotton industry ultimately precludes this book as a good source for useful information. Yafa's bias renders his judgement suspect, and what could have been a fascinating tale becomes yet another piece of propaganda. 
 I did not enjoy this book - it is very "Fundamentalist", which is fine if you are a Christain Fundamentalist - however, if you are not, then it's probably not the book for you 
 This book is uninformative and in this book Charles pretends to have opened his brokerage firm for retail investors but it isn't because the CHARLES SCHWAB BROKERAGE IS TOO EXPENSIVE IT REQUIRES $10,000 TO OPEN a Brokerage ACCOUNT for an indiviual investor[also called retail investor]Harrisdirect,Firstade,and Optionsxpress don't require anything to open a brokerage account for individual investor.   
 First of all the item is too small.  it is about 1/3 the lenght of a pair pants and 1/3 as wide.  So as you can see it is pretty small.  So it is a lot of moving around and adjusting which causes previously ironed parts to become wrinkled again.     It does not make life easier.   good in principle but does not work.  
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 Lee Eisenberg's "The Number" simply does not live up to its promise as a financial planning self-help book or retirement guide. Short on advice and long on anecdotes, little useful information is imparted.  Much better advice can be found in Eric Tyson's "Personal Finance for Dummies", a truly helfpful finance guide for the average person.  
 Whilst some of the more profound and wide-ranging, far out, suggestions/conclusions of Phyllis Atwater may well be correct...this book is much more personal testimonial and intellectual autobiography than it is science or structured argument.  Often the author is found to be arguing by analogy...and yet the point about analogies is that "there is a difference" ie argument by analogy is often flawed.  I agree with  the suggestion the book is poorly structured.  I could immediately have found alternative ways of suggesting reasons for radically different world views...and I could have found more solid evidence that was more clearly and thoroughly documented.  Where are the references eg to McMoneagle or Radin or Robert Monroe 
 This hardcore conservative did not enjoy this book.  The book is filled with a wealth of eye-opening information on significant people that I did not know but should (like Hugo Chavez's new best friend, Noam Chomsky), but the reading is so laborious and draining that I cannot recommend it.  It has none of the light-hearted fun that we often get from Rush Limbaugh.  Rather, it brought to mind the dark experience of listening alone to Michael Savage in a bad mood after dark.  The cheeky title is misleading - this was a joyless book to read 
 This book reads like stereo instructions!  In fact, it contradicts itself more often stereo instructions.  Many terms are used but not defined.  Basically, if you are a student, it's impossible 
 Where's the father in this story?  With all the unfortunate divorcing going on in this world, I plan to inundate my child with stories about happy families with both a mom and a dad.  If it doesn't work out for him when he grows up and gets married, at least I can say I tried my best.  I'm tired of forcing the feminist agenda on our kids.  They need to know that not having a GOOD husband/father at home is not a good thing. Also, I thought the book was boring and the chair was ugly. 
 My aim was to buy a PSAT prep book that would prepare for the test.  I, knowing very little about the reputations of various SAT prep companies, ended up purchasing this book because it was the cheapest on the rack at Borders.  I was, however, immensely disappointed on the quality of instruction it offered.  The first sample test was utterly glutted with errors and mistakes.  I also heard later that the questions weren't even real PSAT questions.  Personally, I plan on contacting Barron's so I can receive a full refund 
 There is nothing I could add here that wasn't already said by the other 1 star reviewers that preceeded me. Just a couple of generic trends: 1. Lots of books get published (and unfortunately read) based on the author's name. Although Moss Cnater has never belonged to the senior guru league (in my opinion and I have read her revious works - tedious and uninspiring), Harvard Business school still carries some weight, although one has to wonder why, based on many distinctly ordinary, even bad books they publish through their Press. And if you read Harvard Business Review, you should have realised by now how mediocre and way overpriced that publication is.  2. One reviewer wonders how could she, a professor at already mentioned uni write so badly. People erroneously associate things together. Just because somebody teaches at a university does not make them good writers; heck, it doesn't even make them good teachers. How many truly great teachers do you remember from your uni days? Zussamenfassung (a weird German word for Summary): Avoid like a plague 
 I purchased this blanket for $30 from Amazon after reading the same reviews I see now.  The negative comment about it being too light weight sounds fake after I saw the blanket and found that it weighted more than I expected from the review.  The real issue is that the quality is very poor.  I returned it and got a $30 blanket from Target and found the quality much better.    Luxuious Egyption cotton--no way. 
 I like Steve Vai. I love Devin Townsend.  I, however, don't especially like this album. Their are some great parts, and some humourus parts, but overall there is about the same amount of bad as good... which is really not what I look for in music.  If you like great guitarwork and screams taht sound like someone is ripping their throat out with air, then you'll like about half of this album, while  the other half is odd little "SHAKAZULU" chants and weird stuff like this 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???

 Beware! On off switch broke machine would not cut off unless unplugged. The place they recommended based on my zip code still has my vacuum and it's been about 2 weeks. :- 
 I never understood why people want to read what is basically someone ranting long enough that it takes up an entire book.  That's what a blog is for, but of course, you can't make money off of a blog.  I like books that are based on research and actual facts, not someone's long winded opinion about every issue that everyone has their own opinion on.    To give an example, in the "Smokers" chapter, Neal makes the pointless observation that a young girl who smokes is most likely easy.  This doesn't really make any case against smoking or sex.  It's like saying that people who play football also lift weights.   Ugh, get a blog, Neal 
 These three guys are amazing musicians in their own right but this album just doesn't work. From a theory and technical standpoint it's very good (some would say brillant). If you have a background in music theory you'll probably like it a lot. There is plenty of meat to chew on when it comes to breaking down the music and understanding what they are doing.   But if you have listened to The Police, Phish and Primus and you are just a big music fan then this is probably a very hard listen. It sounds like a car wreak of those three band's music and there really is nothing new. Trey's guitar work sounds like the work he did with Phish; Stewart's drums are just like The Police (more of the old Police stuff); Clay's bass is right from any Primus song. It sounds like what they did was take those aspects of their styles that would sort of fit together and just laid it out on this album. That's fine, but it's just hard not to think of Phish, The Police and Primus while listening to it.   The highlight of the album IMO, is Army's on Ecstasy. It opens up kind of slow and strange then picks up in a really nice jam frenzy for Trey's solo. That sort section of the ablum works really well together. For that section, it sounds like something outside the relm of Phish, Primus and The Police. 
 Despite what it says on hmv.ca - the title Deceived has not been received.  I ordered it two months ago and was just informed that I wouldnt get it until late January - little do they know that hmv.com says the release is Feb 14/04.  Why dont they figure it out and change the availability - it will not ship in 2-6 weeks cause it doesnt exist! yet 
 [...] Although globalization, the latest theme to embrace the academic and journalistic worlds, is the subject of these two very readable books, it is handled very differently in both. Zachary, a senior writer for the Wall Street Journal, propounds the thesis that a new cosmopolitan figure is emerging on the world stage. This figure is equally at home in Japan or Ireland and is unencumbered by the prejudices of the past. This a new kind of Superman, who treats the world as his oyster and is as happy eating oysters as he is drinking pints of Guinness or bottles of sake. He is the true cosmopolitan and tomorrow, if Zachary is to be believed, belongs to him.  To make the same argument on a global scale, he introduces us to a host of globalized characters. We meet Barry Cox, an English kid from Liverpool who sings pop songs in perfect Cantonese; Vince Morabito, a nomadic farm expert who is equally at home in the wheat fields of Nebraska, the vineyards of Moldova or the rice paddies of Southeast Asia; Soo Ing, the German-educated, Canadian-born daughter of Chinese immigrants, who ranges the Mongolian plains on horseback studying the uses and abuses of fire. These super human characters all seem to be modeled on Indiana Jones, Laurence of Arabia or other such folk heroes. They certainly seem to travel a lot.  Micklethwait and Wooldridge, who both write for the Economist magazine, pursue a broadly similar path and also introduce us to an array of cosmocrats who are spearheading this revolution from one end of the world to the other. The authors introduce us to a range of people who are exporting Southern California's pornography to the four corners of the earth. We meet traditional Moroccan perfume sellers who export their fragrances to the entire world. We also meet Zambian-born economists, German and Japanese auto workers, Singaporean math teachers, Indian entrepreneurs and a galaxy of other characters drawn from just about every nation in the world showing us the benefits of this globalized age. Although the authors also show us some of the downsides, the overall message is clear. Globalization is the way of the future.  Despite articulate prophets like these, that future will be a long time in coming even in export-oriented countries like Japan and Ireland, which remain prisoners to the fortunes of the international economy. Countries and nations will continue to nurture their different cultures and opposition to the pronouncements of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other messiahs of globalization will remain as perennial as the economic insecurity globalization has visited upon most of the world's communities.   People, in other words, will still strive for meaning and a sense of belonging in today's global village. This need to belong will ensure that conflict will remain as perennial as attempts like these two books to reduce all of our desires and experiences to a simple cocktail of clichés. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, belief in Marxism waned. Many of Marxism's apostates have now embraced this new credo. Unfortunately, it explains as little as did the writings of the cosmopolitan Karl Marx, who is used as a straw man in the last chapter of the book by Micklethwait and Wooldridge. Ultimately, theories like globalization, which purport to explain everything, explain absolutely nothing. The same goes for these two books. Although they give us a nice overview of what the authors do with their time, they leave us none the wiser at the end.  Worse still, by marginalizing the very real social and economic problems globalization begets, they help to guarantee that they will continue to fester in the years to come. Individuals like Osama bin Laden, who think globally and act locally, will see to that. There is, in other words, nothing new, noteworthy or novel beneath the covers of these and similar eminently readable but ultimately disappointing books 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 The normal elements of an Anita Blake novel (supernatural detective work, exciting action, and Anita's strong will) are reduced and pushed aside in favor of gratuitous sex scenes.  There's nothing wrong with a little romance, especially if it advances the plot.  However, these repeditive scenes are about as romantic and subtle as a sledgehammer.  They don't contribute to the plot, but instead interrupt it.    The excuse is that Anita has been infected by the ardour, a supernatural hunger for sexual energy.  Supposedly she got it from Jean Claude, even though it was never mentioned in the previous nine books.  It's a very flimsy plot device.   More annoying is the change in Anita.  Always before, she fought stubbornly to maintain her morals against all influcences.  However, she makes no attempt to resist the ardour.    The book is so different in focus, flow, writing style, phrasing, and word choices that I suspect it was partially or entirely ghost written.    I greatly enjoyed all the Anita Blake novels prior to this one.  I recommend reading those.    I advise against reading this one 
 ...but all the recipes come out very bland.  I've tried a few of them and there's really nothing that stands out.  I'll try a few more before I sell this one.  It's a shame, because the book is put together rather well and is easy to follow 
 This book was written by self-proclaimed liberal theologians. It is a compilation of essays by various contributors (all of whom discussed and commented on their peer's additions as well). The authors are stuck in a wholly modern (but creeping toward post-modern) mentality, and see little valuing in any of the traditional teachings and positions. All traditional teachings are thrown out the doors, and new ones are constructed to fill the gap.   If you are looking for an entirely modern theology that operates from modern philosophical foundations, this may be what you are looking for. But traditionalists will find this useful only to understand the way liberal theologians think and what they believe. For that purpose, and that alone, I found it good reading, for I had no real connection to liberal theology; having read this, I can honestly appreciate the author's positions and the presuppositions which led them there (which prejudices the authors are ready to point out are the most difficult part of making "new" theology). Reading this book will prepare the traditionalist for meaningful, positive arguments with his/her liberal counterpart.  Fortress Press ought to be ashamed for publishing this book. It does not give good Lutheran theology, much less solid orthodox Christian teaching 
 "The Cherry Orchard" is an atrocious play.  If we hold this play in high regard, then we dramatist's need to reevaluate our standards.  Chekhov wrote a play that will make you not care an inch about the character's or their situation(s).  For him to think that this is a comedy makes you wonder if he understood the point he himself was trying to make.  The characters are pathetic and they'll make you pity them - not because of their predicaments, but because of whom they are.  I do not recommend 
    I had totally different expectations of what this book would be like.   I thought it would be mini biographies of strong independant women.  Instead, I found it very much a victim minded book.  The author seemed to go off on tangents often about the men in these women's lives instead of concentrating on the women themselves.    
 I have read several of David Morrell's books and enjoy the suspense and mystery as he presents it, but this was a flop!  Not only was it below his standard, but the evil American Government approach presented in this book made it even worse.  If you like books that demonize Americans, this is the one for you 
 This film should have lasted about twenty five minutes. The only real action that occured in the movie would probably play out at about that length. I am no action movie junkie, but In the Bedroom left me desperate for the credits to roll up, just so I could see something move. It is a film filled with talent, from the cast to the crew. But despite that, it loses itself in mood. While I did feel the angst that the characters felt in this film, it simply went on too long. Silent, anesthetized, and gruesomely meticulous, the film had no heartbeat. There was no effort to invest the viewer. In time, it became nothing more than annoying. I stopped sympathizing with the characters, and started desperately desiring a finale. It wasn't a terrible film, but it was a disappointment. All the awards it was nominated for had me expecting something much more powerful and significant; it left me merely drained 
 I was so excited to buy a camcorder that recorded straight to DVD AND took pictures.......Well, the picture quality is AWFUL! I have gotten maybe 20 nice pics out of over a 1000........The problem is its SO low in pixels. We hear about 5MP cameras and up, this camera has less than 1MP!!!! I bought this before I knew anything about megapixels........You have to have 5 or more for the prints to be decent. All of my prints from this camera are bad! And they are only good for email. That's it. The camcorder capabilities are fair. My problem is that it doesn't work well on the computer, and it does NOT play immediately in all dvd players. You HAVE to buy the very expensive RAM discs for editing....Overall, I definitely would NOT buy again and I would not reccommend to a friend. I wish I had spent all that money on something else.... 
 Now, don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of NGDB, and have at one time or another owned all (or most) of their albums on tape, CD, or vinyl. I saw them in 1972, and 1975 when (in my opinion) they were at their creative peak. They are (again in my opinion) a wonderfully talented band, no matter who's in the line up. But, I have to say I was never fan of multi-artist albums. It seems to me a band's creativity can become diluted by straining  it through everone else's musical filter. The first Circle album was ok, simply because the concept was unique, and the songs were really good. The second and third time around, it has become tiresome and boring. The Dirt Band records so infrequently any more that it seems they put out a Circle album when they realize their fans are becoming restless. This newest version of Circle has to be the final one. How far can this concept be taken? The idea of long-haired, seeming rocker types doing country and bluegrass with stars of that genre in 1972 was novel and quite interesting, but this Circle album and the one right before it finds the Dirt Band stretching things a bit. Why can't NGDB record more original studio albums? Why can't they rekindle the innovative, original spark they had when I first discovered them? I realize people change as they get older, and musicians don't carry the creative fire with them throughout their long careers, but Lord a Mighty, this Circle stuff is getting old 
 How can this book possibly be rated as highly as it is?  I just don't get it.  The important information could have been presented in about 5 pages instead of the 425 that it took.  I found myself TRYING to stay awake and pay attention, but was soon quickly flipping through the book to find anything of real substance.  The review below this one has the real point that dave is trying to make... use 4 wedges and learn how far you can hit each one using 3 different backswing lengths.  There you have it 
 This was a horrid sequel; trite and uneven plot throughout.    I cared nothing of the characters, nor their actions as I plodded through this tome. Surely it MUST get better. Shame on me wasting my time on this. IT did not get better. No moonlight. No magnolias. No hint of a viable story. Why did this book ever come to fruition? I assume it ws merely a commercial venture.  I am at a loss of words to even describe how this would/could/should be a ,"sequel to Gone With the Wind."  Margaret Mitchell would be turning over in her grave.      
 This is 90 minutes of slooow computer graphics, mingled pretentiously with montages of wax-museum faces, bits of advertising of all eras, still photos of abandoned buildings and of course The Mushroom Cloud! "Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." I have liked much of the music from Phillip Glass's operas; that's why I bought this disk. I have to say, the visuals here succeed in making Glass's score sound melodramatic, trite, and vapid 
 I picked up this book with much excitement.  I was looking for excellent historical research, completely unbiased representation of facts, just an overall great, indepth look at the history of christ.  Instead I was extremely disappointed and could not even finish the book.  It is biased beyond belief!  This woman went into writing this book with her particular view and absolute faith in her particular beliefs.  It is not a case of being curious in a subject, doing the research and drawing a conclusion as I had hoped.  It is a case of playing a certain role in this life and retaining no compassion, curiosity, acceptance or understanding of any alternate histories, beliefs, viewpoints, etc. and expelling that specific propaganda on paper.  Very disappointing, very unoriginal, very uninformed.    This book was a complete waste of money and time.  
 In one of what appears to be Carole Radizwill's not-so-subtle jabs at her mother-in-law (and at many of the extended family), she implies Lee wondered what exactly her son saw in Carole ... something along the lines of "how much do they have in common beides ABC?"  After finishing this book, I have to say I have no idea what, if anything, they did have in common, nor, more importantly, what it was that first caused them to fall in love.  While I can understand and appreciate the author's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship, I think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place.  As has been commented on by many reveiwers, she sounds much more passionate when she writes of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (again, not in a lesbian way, but in an idealized school-girl crush way).  I found myself wondering if they really were as close as Carole portrays, or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to Carolyn forever.  
 I really enjoyed the first book in this series, but feel like this second book goes far, far astray. The first book sets up a wonderful world in which dragons fight in the air during the naval battles of the Napolionic (sp?) war. This book throws it all away to get onto a literal slow boat to China. I bought the third book at the same time, I hope the series picks back up 
 This book is an indictment against God. Paul's thorn in the flesh was a demonic spirit. The word "messenger" used there is the same word that is used over and over in the Bible for Angel.  2Cor 12:7  And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.   How much clearer could this verse be? "the messenger of Satan,"  God was telling Paul that he had been given authority over the devil, and he should use it.  John 10:10 says, "The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly." 
 I purchased this book as a going to bed book for my baby girl.  It puts me to sleep before I can even get halfway through it (so I guess it's effective).  Way too long in my opinion 
 I've been looking forward to watch these features. And I was rather disapointed, even if the décor is superb, the acting fine and the mystery well written... The dialogues are boring, some scenes are meant to be funny, exciting or whatever - but you can see the machinery of the screenwriter -  This whole series is just a weak 'ersatz' for the real stuff (Poirot, Holmes, Morse, ... 
 I have enjoyed several books by Anna Quindlen and looked forward to her latest offering. I settled down for an evening of reading 3 nights in a row before I finally gave up. I found the writing trite and boring. I didn't care about the characters as it took too long for them to become something. I'm wondering if this was something she wrote earlier in her career and tried to make a silk purse from a sow's ear. Rise and Shine? Not this time 
 This is a very poor book. It has almost nothing to do with Las Vegas at all. It centers on porn stars and the porn industry, and the people profiled are most vapid and boring along with being incapable of reflection. The narrator's inability to make note of their deficient qualities and provide any sort of insight is its real flaw; however, as Sheehan appears incapable of judging anything or anybody which is indicative of many an academic nowadays. These types concentrate on being "tolerant" and "non-judgmental" which results in their having nothing to say. Porn is a means to an end for most guys. It isn't intriguing or meaningful. It's something in lieu of something else. If you enjoy reading about Las Vegas, I'd advise you to look at other titles. 
 Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELL and THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MAN STANDING did little for me . . . add SPLIT SECOND, which I just heard, to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller about two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together to solve two campaign-trail crimes . . . I cared little about any of the characters, and there were far too many subplots floating around for my taste . . . the ending also didn't do much for me, as it brought too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly, I did not particularly "buy" the man behind the crimes; he just wasn't  all that believable. 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 Our 6-year-old daughter just got this bear for her birthday - unfortunatley, it doesn't work the way they claim.  I hid it at one end of the house, my daughter began searching in the opposite end of the house and the transmitter said "You're getting warmer... (which obviously she wasn't...)".  Half the time she just found the bear accidentally without it giving any hints at all - it just kept saying comments like "You're fun to play with" and other such statements, but nothing to help direct her to the bears location.  She just ended up wandering around the house and the comments coming from the transmitter were mostly haphazard and had nothing to do with where the bear was located.  So the "fun" lasted for barely 10 minutes.  I would love to return it, but we already threw away the box... If your child wants this toy, I would highly suggest you try to guide her toward something else 
 Whether or not you like this collection of essays will depend on your definition of travel writing. D.Cooper's "Canadian Gothic", J.McPhee's "A Fleet of One" and B.Donahue's "Under the Sheltering Sky" are all excellent. However many of the pieces chosen are little more than self-indulgent fluff. Was 2004 such a mediocre year for travel writing? M.Byers "Monuments to Our Better Nature" and R.Chevat's incoherent "Screenwriters Vacation" and M.Gorra's "Innocents Abroad?" are hardly memorable.  As another review has pointed out the selections seem to come from a rather limited field: The New Yorker, National Geographic, Travel&Leisure. There are thousands of publication venues, yet Pico Iyer decided to treat us  to an anthology that is  top heavy with selections from the  main stream "Big Media" press. The publisher of this series, Houghton-Mifflin hasn't strayed far from the ground that it feels most comfortable with-established main stream authors. Even the piece by Tim Cahill does not represent his best writing. Most of the selections in this book seem like warmed-up left-overs.  As another reviewer has  mentioned,  only 4 of the 24 selected authors are women writers. This just boggles the mind... were there no women writers of merit in 2004?  My main concern is that few of these selections are really "travel stories". Some are set in foreign locales, but deal with subjects like teaching English in Tanzania, riding the bus in NYC,  famine in Ethiopia ,and  political repression in Burma. There is also an irritating post-9/11 angst in several of the essays. While this maybe a  reflection of the mood of  American writers in 2004  coming to grips with their new found feeling of insecurity in their comfortable middle-class lives, it does not reflect the daily  pre-occupations of the other 5 billion souls on the planet. There is a self-centered navel gazing in this collection of essays that reflects some of the worst, not the  best of recent travel writing.  Nowhere in this collection will you find the brilliant writing of  W. Thesinger, Freya Stark, Norman Lewis, Eric Hansen,  or Jan Morris. You will find a lot of boring and recondite references to Henry James  however.  This collection of essays is to travel writing what Starbucks is to a bistro . If you can't tell the difference from the real thing, you might enjoy it. Maybe.   I would give this book a big miss, and send a message to Houghton-Mifflin . Donald Rumsfeld famously referred to the "old Europe". This collection of essays isn't even "old-style travel writing". It is a mis-directed bore, brought to you from the same corporate folks that convinced you that chicken McNuggets is  really food. This isn't travel literature. It isn't even literature. Most of the collection is dross. 
 I bought this book recently and opened it, full of enthusiasm, ready to read. However I found that it's more a pathology than pathophysiology book. It tries to mix the two subjects and as a result it does not cover sufficiently either of the two. It is nicely organized though and may be good for other health sciences, but NOT for medical students! Many of its pictures are "borrowed" from Robbin's Basic Pathology 7th ed. by Kumar, Cotran et al 
 The amount of matter which the author has repeated again and again if you minus all that repeated matter, the book would hardly be of about a 100 pages .. Don't even borrow to read it . 
 I am a huge fan of Kinky Friedman's books, but was very disappointed with this one.  It's the first book he's written that I actually didn't finish, it's just too introspective and frankly not Kinky's usual style.  I expected to be entertained but was just bored.  I hope Kinky's next book will be back to his normal craziness 
 this book is a Rip OFF of Peter Lynch's One Up On Wall Stee 
 It was alright at first. I was looking for a relatively cheap camera for occasional picture taking. Outside pictures are okay, but indoor pictures are horrid.   However, after a while, the battery life drains too fast. Honestly, invest in a better camera even if you want a cheap one. This one doesn't last more than a month 
 It's fragmented and feels like it doesn't know whether it wants to be funny or serious, but I could have lived with that if it hadn't been so scarily oblivious and unpleasant. One example: "And I'm secretly thrilled that I might actually be starting a friendship with someone as cool--and as black--as Angie."  Oh, great. Because black people just LOVE that. I mean, how cool is that? Rich white lady wants to be my friend because I'm black! Groovy! I love to be an accessory! She doesn't have to feel like she's a self-centered, useless rich boob anymore, because she's different! She has a black friend! And a gay one! How rebellious!   And don't get me started on how she fancies herself some wild-and-crazy partier but still thinks oral sex is "taboo" and "antifeminist" and that any guy who wants to do a woman up the butt is necessarily gay.   Who is this book for? Not for black people, gay people, non-rich people, or any woman who has ever enjoyed any kind of sex beyond the standard missionary type. In other words, it's for Dr. Laura, and that's about it 
  I read this book many years ago and reviewed it yet again at the prompting of yet another Leftist dolt, I found it illogically constructed, breathlessly conspiratorial and vacuous. It is the favored deceit of Leftists that there is some distinction between "Fascism" or National Socialism and International Socialism. There is none. National Socialism in Germany, Fascism in Italy and other state worshiping monopolistic governmental construct has no distinguishing characteristics from states based upon Lenin/Stalin/Mao/Castro's Socialism.    It is a lie that the Comintern invented after the collapse of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact for the division of Eastern Europe between the National Socialist state and the Soviet Union. This cooperation terminated by the opening of hostilities between the two socialist entities. Germany's attack was predicated upon  competition over the east's wealth not ideology.    Reagan and Bush are the defenders of the democratic institutions of the west in line with the founders of the United State while the Left is the heir of a foreign born, degenerate and alien ideology that has produced nothing but slaughter and despair wherever and whenever it overthrows the established order.       
 This new monograph has been released to coincide with the Whitney's retrospective.  Both the long over due retrospective and the new monograph are lacking in quantity and depth needed in doing justice to  this  amazingly prolific and important artist.  Abrams' previous Neel  monograph  had many more images and excerpts of  important interviews with Neel   throughout the book (provided by the forsight of Patricia  Hills.)  The new  book, under the Whitney museums' auspice, includes interviews with some of  the sitters.  While these anecdotes are interesting it doesn't make up for  the total superiority of the 1983 monograph (reprinted in 1995.)  If you  can find a used version of the previous monograph, you would be wise to  aquire it.  I also recommend Pamela Allara's "Pictures of People,  Alice Neel's American Portrait Gallery"  which puts Neel's work in a  cultural context (from the depression through the feminist movement. 
 Tedious and inane come to mind. It is written as a first person narrative consisting almost entirely of a stream of disparaging comments about everyone else written in a "catty" pseudo-feminist style, rambling descriptions of Egyptian archaeology - real or imagined - thinly veiled racist comments about the "ignorant natives" of Egypt and inept sexual innuendo. The book is very slow moving and the plot seems forced. The characters do not come across as real.  Very disappointing. Leave this one on the library shelf 
 My challenge would no doubt be viewed with contempt, despite the many justified challenges of the status quo in history. Somehow it is always thought that although profound mistakes were made in the past, the contemporary establishment has things straightened out. My contention is that what is called Goedel's proof is a fundamental embarrassment in the history of logic and mathematics.  There are many particulars in this book that I can criticize which extend beyond Goedel. There is the formalization of deductive systems tracing back to Hilbert. It consists in using symbols without meaning, which are afterward "interpreted" according to subject matter. The like happened most prominently in non-Euclidean geometry, when terms like "straight line" and "plane" were reinterpreted to designate certain curved lines and surfaces, to then demonstrate that some Euclidean theorems do not hold. The problem is that this commits the basic fallacy of equivocation. By redefining words, the statements containing them no longer apply to the original meanings. Likewise, meaningless symbols in formal systems can be defined in conflicting ways. Presently this concerns the use of "Goedel numbers" for such symbols.  "Goedel's proof" is about a sentence which may be phrased as  "THIS STATEMENT IS UNPROVABLE (IN THE SYSTEM)".  The sentence has been recast into logical symbols, and it is these symbols, individually or combined, that are given "Goedel numbers". The argument then is that whatever is determined about the sentence applies to the numbers, viz. to mathematics. The equivocation should be obvious, but alas it isn't. The thinking is explained away by examples like the use of algebra in geometry. But these concern actual mathematical content. The sentence now at issue has no such content, the numbering merely designating the linguistic constituents.   Now to the sentence itself. As indicated there inside parentheses, the sentence is said unprovable in whatever deductive system is used, but Goedel is held to have proved it via "meta-mathematical" means outside the system. This contention I see as an excuse, avoiding contradiction. For, whatever the logic in the proof, it can be made part of the system. To exclude valid logical procedures from deductive systems unjustifiably cripples the systems, and to do so only serves the purpose of claiming an impossibility by not utilizing available tools.  This means that the alleged unprovability in logic, let alone mathematics, of statements otherwise decided true is false, and the statements can thus easily be shown to harbor contradictions and accordingly constitute paradoxes, rather than be part of an assumed consistent system. Regarding the above capitalized sentence, the argument advanced can be put as follows.  If the statement were provable then its negation,  "THE STATEMENT IS PROVABLE",  would also be provable, since that is what the provability would mean, and if this negation were provable then the original statement would also be provable, since the negation says so (p.99 in the book, in different words).  Then it is argued (p.100) that since "if a formula and its...negation can both be derived in some formal calculus [deductive system], then the calculus is not consistent", it follows that if it is consistent, "neither the formula...nor its negation can be demonstrable".  (This is said to make the formula "undecidable", which interestingly supposes the system consistent, in saying, p.101, "that an undecidable formula can be constructed within [it]". Here we see another pitfall of "formal", i.e. meaningless, systems. It is somehow thought that if they comply with grammatical rules, there is no problem. But grammatical sentences can in meaning be contradictory.)  It is further argued (pp.101-2) that one of the above capitalized statements must be true, and since the initial one was found "undecidable", namely to have "no proof inside [the system]", it is the true one, by asserting that unprovability.  It is finally reemphasized that this was not deduced "from the axioms and rules of a formal system, but by a meta-mathematical argument."  But those axioms and rules, unlike contended, easily accommodate the logic, which is quite common. That neither of the above capitalized sentences is provable because it implies the other follows by the "law of contradiction"; that one of them must presumably be true follows by the "law of excluded middle"; and that it is the initial sentence which is true, since just found unprovable, can be said to follow by the "law of identity". Thus the unprovable sentence is contradictorily proved via the well-known "laws of thought".  As indicated, the sentence is correspondingly internally contradictory and can be added to other paradoxes, rather than be proclaimed true and unprovable. 
 Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as a trucking company saleswoman who goes from town to town to visit potential clients. Joanna (Gellar) has been having recurring visions and waking nightmares about a woman being murdered. Guided by the visions, she goes to La Salle, Texas to seek answers about the woman and her killer who might just be after her next. We learn that Joanna and her father have been in a car accident when she was eleven years old that changed her completely. Who is the woman she sees in her visions? Is everything related?  The trailers for this film will have you think you're gearing up to watch a supernatural horror film; make no mistake, this film is a thriller, and not a horror film. The first half-hour is extremely slow-paced and quite uninteresting. I just couldn't get into this movie. As the story unfolds, I became curious to see how things would turn out, desperately hoping there was more going on than what was on the surface. Sadly, there wasn't much behind the shell of this film. The twist ending disappointed me terribly. Go in the special features on the DVD and watch the alternate ending, which is, in my opinion, a much more satisfying ending. By changing a few details in the plot, that ending could've been used and would definitely have been a more powerful way to finish the film.   On the up side, the director shows promise with stylish compositions, shaky cam shots that put you in the middle of the action (and manage to make you jump once or twice). Gellar gives a subdued performance appropriate for the part. The supporting cast is also effective in their roles. The score was subtle, the cinematography made you feel Texas in all its glorious heat and Joanna's nightmares at their seedy best.   If you're looking for a horror film, look elsewhere. If you're a fan of Gellar, you might enjoy it more than I did. Other than that, I can't recommend this film; it just didn't make the passing grade in my book 
 The story of a model whose looks and identify are severely transformed due to a car crash is intriguing and beautiful at first. But instead of focusing on her, Jennifer Egan throws in a strange Internet company, an ambitious homeless, a terrorist, the family of an ex friend, a kid with cancer -- everything but the kitchen sink. The result is bizarre and irritating and by the end, I totally lost interest. 
 You'd think that, Ma being my favourite cellist and Williams being my favourite composer of this century, this album would be at least a semi-hit (with me, anyway)... But it's not great -- at all. Some parts are almost boring, others are too demanding of the listener's attention (not in a good way). I am quite disappointed with this CD! Could've been amazing!!! If you love what you know of Williams, you might want to take a sneak preview before buying... it's not his average stuff! No knocks on either musician -- just not at all their best work 
 I received the raindrop technique treatment, and the experience was wonderful.  The essential oils generate a deep heat that you can feel in your spine.  I've had chronic daily pain in my back since 1997 from repetitive motion injuries.  When I got off the table after the treatment, I had NO pain, and I mean ZERO pain, for the first time in years.  It was extraordinary.  My range of motion was increased and I just wanted to cry from the relief.  It lasted for about 2-3 days, which didn't surprise me all that much.. it takes more than one day to heal from years of pain and scar tissue.  HOWEVER...2-3 days after the treatment, I became extremely ill.  My lungs became so severely congested that it felt like they were being ripped out when I coughed.  I have never been that congested in my entire life and it lasted for almost a month.  I then did more research on the essential oils used in the treatment.  And I wish I had done that beforehand.  First of all, articles regarding Gary Young's complete lack of credentials are fairly easy to find online.  Secondly, some of the oils can cause allergic reactions if not used properly.  When someone has alot of scar tissue in their connective tissues and muscles, there are toxins such as lactic acid and metabolic wastes that are locked into those tissues.  If those metabolic chemicals are all suddenly released into the bloodstream, it can cause a detox reaction.  Many people might have a fabulous experience with the raindrop technique.  But it's really not wise at all to just treat anyone without consideration of these, and other factors.  I am a licensed massage practitioner.  And I'm advising other LMP's not to approach raindrop therapy like it's just a feel good spa technique.  Do your homework before you just start treating people with these oils. 
 I gotta give it to that little girl who plays Harriet in the movie. She did a great job. But, I found Rosie O'Donnell's performance really lacking. Which made the film a little boring to watch at times. 
 This book has got to be the most self-indulgent book I have ever read, and I did not find it helpful at all (being overweight myself). While I do agree that overeating & other food behaviors can point to a tendency to avoid emotional issues I think it is very misleading to insist that this is always so. While I do believe that beating yourself up endlessly is counter-productive this notion of continual "body talk" and conversations with body parts and the "inner caretaker" seems excessive. To atrribute eating behavior to male opression of females, and that this gives rise to something the authors call "Bad Body Fever" is a way of saying that women can't help but be influenced by the male-dominated culture, which I do not believe. To me books of this kind speak volumes about the self-obsessed nature of American culture overall than anything else. The often-heard phrase "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar" applies here: I say that sometimes overeating is just overeating. It's time for psychobable to simply take it's place in the grand variety of human experience and stop being used as the touchstone and only real answer to all of life's problems. Unless you want to spend endless hours blaming culture for your difficulty, or scraping through your childhood and psychie for the "real answer" don't bother with this book 
 This book was poorly written.  The relation between the two stories was minimal.  The story was hard to follow, 'cause I can't read when I fall asleep from boredom.  The descriptions gave me no pictures in my mind, Dr. Hamiska was a big blur, and I only got a picture of the heat, which I honestly don't CARE about.  It was a real page turner...I was eager to finish the book, and get it over with.  I wouldn't have read it if my teacher didn't assign it.  My dog refused to eat the pages I ripped out, and seemed to, much like me, think the book stunk 
 i got these as a college grad gift and while i love to wear them because of the thought behind them and who they came from, they have very large, very visible flaws.  i know the color and clarity were posted on the website, but the other reviews made me wonder if i got an exceptionally bad pair?  people won't notice anything without taking a good close-up look, though; and like i said, i still love to wear them despite the quality 
 Please see tj-mccarthy's review elsewhere here; he is, to borrow a phrase from across the pond, spot-on in his comments. Just this week I cancelled my 10-year subscription to PC Magazine. One thing not mentioned elsewhere is that the new editor, Jim Louderback, has dropped the old tagline on the front cover, "An Independent Guide to Technology". I conjecture that the reason for doing so is that this magazine is no longer independent and is, in fact, just a marketing vehicle for various products. If you are like me and you do not like stealth marketing, stay away from this publication 
 I was asked if Umberto Eco was as much a pompous windbag in Foucault's Pendulum as he was in his other novels and responded:  I would say his novels are aimed squarely at the purveyors of pretension. When I was reading Foucault's Pendulum I got the same "pompous windbag" impression and concluded that I could have photocopied vast sections of the the Necronomican of Abdul Al-Hazred and the Yog-Sothoth just as easily and pasted together my own book by following the Dungeons and Dragons Rule Book. But don't listen to me -- I have never been that impressed with Eco, especially as a novelist -- Hamlet said it best: "Words, Words, Words" or was it "very like a whale"? I suspect Eco was just trying to sound as erudite as Joyce (or at least Professor Irwin Corey). However, Foucault's Pendulum might well be his greatest work since no novel he has written since has been as well received.  I did peek at the sales figures for this novel but they have been suspiciously hidden away in a monastery in the Apennines and the only hint I got was the mention of the bump Eco's sales received with the popularity of The Da Vinci Code. Interestingly, someone asked why Eco didn't sue Brown for plagiarism; a better question might be why the authors of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail didn't sue Eco ... And the answer of course is, follow the money.  But rest assured, despite having attempted to read this pile and given up in disgust, I will give it a generous rating -- 2 stars. Suffice it to say, however, that Foucault's Pendulum had more in common with The Da Vinci Code than just the arcane historical mystery.  I'll be traveling back to New Jersey next week and will be able to visit the large dent in the wall of my office where the parabolic arc of this novel met with the obstinacy of lath and plaster.  But let's be a little fair about this and realize the Foucault's Pendulum, when compared to the other airport gift-shop thrillers, is certainly adequate to cover the time taken for a trans-oceanic flight, whether it keeps you awake or not. Although if they are showing Raiders of the Lost Ark .. 
 I watch lots of show and some time wants to record good show while watching it also. If properly connected thru satelite dish to this unit and to TV, Is this unit record the show while watching the same show on TV? (Some of the units can not record while you are watching the show, TV has to be off !!!!!! 
 I wasn't sure what I'd get but it turns out to be basicly an overpriced noteboo 
 This book has won the Hugo award and may have had a tremendous impact when it first came out, unfortunately it is now greatly outdated.  While some books hold up better over the course of time, this one did not.  Looking purely at the science involved in the book I'll give Leiber credit for at least thinking of it.  It's a nice premise to theorize the gravitational impact of what would happen to the Earth if a planet the same size as it called, "The Wander" suddenly appeared in space next to it.  He does a decent job covering the effects this would cause to the Earth and the Moon with the changing of the tides, flooding, earth quakes, and volcanic activity, but I think he may have missed the effects that the gravitational pull of Earth would have had on "The Wander" as well.  I also had trouble with several of the characters who seem right out of the 60's.  In the 60's there must have been a great deal of mistrust between the populous and the government and several of the characters reflect this feeling in that, "The Man", or "The Fuzz" are out to get them.   It also appeared that there had been no advances in science on the Earth since the 60's but yet we have a manned base on the Moon and have astronauts out by Mars.  It just didn't add up 
 "The Island of Lost Maps" is the story of a petty crook named Gilbert Bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the '90s.  Posing as a researcher, Bland would enter rare-book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a single-edged razor.  Then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting -- or at least unquestioning -- dealers.  Before being busted at the Peabody Library at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, he had stolen more than a half million dollars' worth of maps.  "Island" is the first book for author Miles Harvey.  In the book, he tries to pull together enough material on the crime and map collecting to create an appealing 350-page book.  He is only partly successful.  I found the material on Bland's crime fascinating.  However, Bland as a subject does not fill the entire 350 pages because his life is dull.  Unfortunately the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text.  I found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime.  There is some interesting stuff about map engraving in the age of discovery and modern mapmaking. But as a true crime book, it over extends itself.  It would be a more interesting book to read if it were shorter and more focused 
 Neoliberalism was born on September 11, 1973, when a US-backed military coup murdered the democratically elected President of Chile and ushered in the tyranny of General Pinochet who murdered and tortured thousands, closed parliament, and outlawed political parties and trade unions.  If that doesn't give you pause about the compatibility of neoliberalism and democracy, read this book.    In Hayek's model of an ideal constitution each citizen is given one vote per lifetime when they reach the age of 45 (page 113).  Then, Hayek decides that's probably too generous, and calls for an "indirect method of election" where the legislature would appoint regional delegates who would appoint new legislators, without any popular vote at all (page 114).    Neoliberals hate democracy, in both theory and practice, and are much more comfortable with an oligarchy 
 I heard lots of hype for this when it came out which caused me to purchase this one instead of the original. Theres a short homosexual scene when The Sgt is in the German hospital and he is kissed on the lips by the medic or doctor. Did that go on that much that theres a need to portray it. I'm surprised in 1980 this was filmed or even thought of since gay was not in back then. Also the scene of him spanking the Hitler youth who shot the G.I. was stupid. The scenes added I could have done without, not too much substance in them. The editors were right the first time when they did this without Fullers permission. I liked it before when there was a sense of honor and pride that I got from the movie, without the sex and useless characters added 
 When I first started using this, I loved it.  It worked fine in my car cassette deck and had decent sound.  In fact, I bought a second one for my wife.  Then, after about two weeks, it stopped working.  It would no longer play in my cassette deck, which ejected it as soon as I put it in every time.  I tried contacting Coby's support on the Web, but they were unresponsive.  Luckily, Amazon took it back for a refund.  Note that they no longer sell these directly.  Bet they had too many returns.. 
 While I did appreciate the author's honesty and self-explorative approach to this book, I agree with the previous reviewer that this book went on way too long.  The author actually presents the same anecdotes in different  chapters and struggles with the same questions again and agin throughout  the text, with little movement forward.  Funny that the last section is  entitled "Time to Move On." because she doesn't seem to do that  very well. Unlike the previous reviewer, I don't recall anything in the  book that indicated that the author's weight is contributing to health  problems; in fact, my recollection is that she was able to ameliorate a  number of health problems through healthy eating and exercise without any  weight loss.  My sense was that she was attempting to demonstrate that we  talk about weight loss as a health necessity, when it is more often a  culturally mandated appearance issue.  My favorite line in the whole book  was a quote from columnist Ellen Goodman: "Show me a woman who only  wants to be thin for her health and I'll show you a man who buys Playboy  just to read the interview.&quot 
 This is a short biographical essay on John XXIII sandwiched between pages and pages of anti-papal screed and pseudo-history.  I have read all of the author's "Hinges of History" series, but will read him no more; Mr. Cahill's bias and cant are a barrier to the necessary trust between author and reader. Here's the book in a nutshell: reforming/liberal popes = good, conservative/traditional popes = bad. I am exaggerating only a little in my encapsulation! The author frequently substitutes assertion for argument, particularly in regard to the current pope, John Paul II. After re-reading the book, I am still unsure what it is that the author dislikes so much about the current pope except that he appears to be holding the line on traditional Catholic teaching.  For all the much-vaunted tolerance of liberal believers, I was shocked by the author's repeated ad hominem attacks upon the character of popes and others who take views not sanctioned by the author.  As for Mr. Cahill's liberal utopia, I suggest that he look at the Episcopal Church in the US for a picture of what the Church will look like if we vote on our doctrine and elect our bishops; I don't think it is an improvement!  This book is a perfect example of the saying that "when orthodoxy becomes optional, orthodoxy will soon be prohibited."  I have tried but cannot understand those (like the author) who want to belong to an organization with which they completely disagree and then want to make the organization over in their own image. There are plenty of non-hierarchical denominations out there if Mr. Cahill truly wants one. I recommend that you avoid this book or read only that portion of it dealing directly with John XXIII.  A more scholarly alternative from the same perspective without the cant is Eamon Duffy's Saints and Sinners 
 This is the kind of book that can be very appealing to someone in the midst of a divorce; That there is a Proven 7 Step Method to anything is a little suspect, as even the most trusting of us must admit.  As I am going thru a divorce, I read all of the customer reviews, and purchased two books in hopes that they would teach me the path to reconcilliation.  I sent one to my wife.  What this book does teach you is very practical ways in which to slightly improve your communication, not make things worse in the divorce process (the Last Resort Technique, among others - I gave up on them), and how to temporarily deal with the emotional difficulty of a potentially permanent separation from someone you really (or think you really) love.    However, this book does not address the root causes of divorce, nor does it help to address the real problems in the relationship, which may or may not involve many of the kinds of manipulations that are espoused in this book.  The author does admit that this is a sort of band-aid to the entire situation, and indicates that real marriage counseling should be undertaken as quickly as possible.  Ultimately, you must decide whether or not to choose the path of this book and the games that it prescribes, or choose the difficult path of understanding what happened in the relationship, accepting yourself and others unconditionally, and becoming comfortable in your own skin.  Only at that point will you be able to deal with your spouse from a level of integrity, empathy, and mutual respect.  Even if your spouse does not recognize that you've done the work, that you are committed to the relationship and improving yourself, you will be much better off in the next relationship.  If you are up for the challenge of unconditional self acceptance (warts and all), acceptance of others, quitting the cycle of blame, and becoming less disturbed (and less disturbable), I would refer you to "A Guide to Rational Living," by Albert Ellis.  It is hard work, but very rewarding 
 Where's the subtitle of this very effective book?  Did the modern editors simply take it away?  Darwin titled his book: "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" and subtitled it: "The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."  When Hitler came to power in 1933, he had one overarching idea in mind: his radical Nazi racial philosophy built on the Darwinian principle of natural selection.  Hilter thought the Aryans were the fittest and he wanted to help speed up the "inevitability" of natural selection.  He first started off with the sterilization of nine categories of "the unfit" which were feebleminded, schizophrenia, manic depression, Huntington's chorea, epilepsy, hereditary body deformities, deafness, hereditary blindness and alcoholism.  He then worked his way up to attempting the complete extermination of entire categories and entire races of people.  Speaking of modern day little Hitlers, the Columbine High School shooters carried out their bloody rampage on Hilter's birthday, April 20th, and had planned on causing more than 500 deaths at the high school.  Shooter Eric Harris had written on his website, "YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE??? Natural SELECTION!  It's the best thing that ever happened to the Earth.  Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms."  After the bloody rampage, Harris' autopsy report revealed that he was wearing a T-shirt with the words "Natural Selection" emblazoned on the front.  Beware of those who hold this book dear to their hearts.  This book is not about man descending from the apes.  The ideas in this book have caused and continue to cause more deaths than any other notion in modern history 
 I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable.  After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq.  However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.  Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction?  As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, "the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong," which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility.  You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction 
 Bryson is certainly witty. But any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author's snotty and obnoxious tone. I can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits; there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self-image. What a whining, immature, mean jerk. And by the way, there's a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book. 
 Tiresome, repetitive sexual descriptions, no character development, unexplained events, no plot, very little humor.  Ten years ago, Hamilton was doing interesting work, exploring some moral issues, having some character development, and humor.  Now both the Blake and Gentry series are predicable and sex obsessed 
 I bought the book even after reading previous reviews.   Oh well.  If you have any knowledge of Windows and it's functionality and want to improve on those skills, this book won't do it.  It's all about tools and utilities you can download or purchase, and how to use those programs.  Not much insite into Windows built in tools and better ways of using them.  I did think the host files and DNS section could be helpful, but as a previous poster said, you can find tips like that on the internet 
  I enjoyed this movie. I orginially saw this move 30 years ago and it brought back some good memories from the seventies. I wouldn't really call it a porn movie. It's more of a movie with adult humor. I'd give it an "R" rating compared to some of the stuff that is available today 
 I've already written my review, but then I remembered a song that does stand out within the movie. Anne Hathaway's version of the Queen song "Somebody to Love" is really quite good and entertaining as well. Were more of the movie like that, it would have been more fun.  I beg to differ with other viewers over "Don't Go Breakin' My Heart".  I did not like it. Anne's voice was again good, clear and true. The male lead's voice was not. And the song, in my opinion, just didn't fit. It is way too pop and campy in its rendition.  More like bad karaoke 
 Sure, the information in this book is current if your potential agent is doing a life term in Sing Sing. But of the five queries I sent out based on the information in this book, two were just unanswered and three came back addressee unknown. Maybe I picked the only five bad addresses in the book, or maybe current it isn't 
 just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. 
 Marc Evans' Trauma is not to be confused with Dario Argento's Trauma, although it does seem eager to be confused with Jacob's Ladder, borrowing a few clumsily executed visual effects and the central "Which reality is reality?" conundrum to remarkably little effect. Despite a surprisingly good turn from Colin Firth as a stalker-cum-murder-suspect who may or may not have killed a pop star, whose wife may or may not have died in the accident that left him in a coma and whose landlady-cum-romantic interest Mina Suvari may or may not be a figment of his imagination, it's a thin and uninvolving story that fails to be bolstered by the visual techniques that keep you at arms length from the characters without ever being particularly successful in their own right.   There is a brief section halfway through where the picture threatens briefly to become interesting, but it all too quickly passes. Not unwatchable, just flat as a mill pond. Still, it does set new cinematic ground in giving all the ants in the film individual screen credits. 
 I'm a Terry Pratchett fan. I've greatly enjoyed all of the other books by him that I've read. This one, however, was disappointing. It didn't have any of the "laugh out loud" moments that make his other books so much fun to read. It was amusing, but not hilarious 
 Louise Riotte passed away in 1998 at the age of 89.   Since her passing, the subject matter contained in this title is widely disseminated free on the internet.  Her father taught her to believe in and practice astrology, her mother was a practicing herbalist.   Together they influenced her life and her books, Astrological Gardening, Sleeping with a Sunflower, and her Raising Animals by the Moon. 
 This is a book of pleasantries for people who are easily influenced and can't think about what they're reading.  "Find the positive!" it says.  If your life is hell, look at the pretty shiny fire.  The author makes points that range from valid but unhelpful to contradictory and moronic 
 I am a SUPER Yu Yu Hakusho fan!  However, this movie was horrible.  The voices were different, which screwed up the movie bad as far as I am concerned.  AND, as if that weren't enough, they changed the whole attidutes of the characters.  NOT RECOMMENDED FOR DIE HARD HAKUSHO FANS! : 
 As a collector of Toy books I thought "elements of Pop Ups" should be in my collection.... save your money for the real books, even at the discounted price of $28 dollars I would do better tearing up much cheaper books and learning from them than from this.    We that like the Pop ups are supposed to be brothers but this is an outrageous price for so little work 
 Two of the short stories in this book, "Running out of Dog" and "Gone down to Corpus" are not new stories.  Running out of Dog is a spelendid example of what we expect from Mr. L. writing about ironies and tragedies of average people.  But, it should have been noted that 40% of this book is not original.    The others are average reads, over before we have any understganding of the characters Mr. Lehane writes so well about.  None of the others are full of tension, irony, comedy, tragedy, and suspense we've all come to expect. They are mediocre stores meant to sell on the author's excellent reputation.  We waited a long time for another Lehane.  This book certainly does not showcase his talents 
 I'm a student at Williams College and I previewed what the book said about my school, through the "Look inside the book feature." This book says Williams has 1,200 undergrads which is completely wrong. We have about 2,100 undergrads. Being 75% off about a school's size is not good. I dont know if there are other factual errors but based on the Williams entry, I would assume so 
 I read this book only because it was lent to me by an unfortunate person who was lumbered with it for Mothers Day. It was the only BTB book I've read since "Woman of Substance" and I fine it hard to believe that it was written by the same writer! The dialogue was unbelievably twee and some of it was out of a Victorian novel---the heroine calls her brother --Brother mine!!!!!Oh brother! I finished it because it was so bad that it was funny 
 Why? This is a total waste of time and money on Disney's part. They just don't have that "magic" that they had in the 90's. I hope something happens because some of the animated movies are losing credibility. JMHO  
 This was Rand's first work of nonfiction, and it is supposed to be an introduction to her philosophy of Objectivism. But it is certainly not the best place to start. The book consists of one rather lengthy essay, followed by excerpts from her four novels. As expected, more pages are devoted to excerpts from Atlas Shrugged than to any of the other novels - in fact, than to all of the others put together. Galt's seventy-plus page speech is included in its entirety.  Unfortunately, the excerpts aren't as interesting outside the context of the novels. Even worse, the title essay is probably the weakest Rand ever wrote. In it, Rand attempts to explain all of history in terms of the two types of men who have dominated it, Attila and the Witch Doctor. Attila represents those who have ruled men by force, whereas the Witch Doctor represents the irrational mystics who have controlled men's minds. The whole thing is just plain ridiculous.  If you want to know what Rand thought, you'd be better off starting with The Virtue of Selfishness, followed by Capitalism: the Unknown Ideal. 
 I was told I had to read this book for an education class.  Although I am an avid reader and usually enjoy reading, I did not like this book.  In all of my training, I have been told to try to get along with my fellow teachers and my administration.  I guess she did not learn this lesson 
 Bought two spoons and within 2 months both had split along the glue lines.  The spoons were hand washed.  Get spoons but I can't afford to replace them every two months 
 AS usual, Brzezinski is on his favourite horse: preserve imperialism and American capital, divide and conquer. It is good though, as there are at least 19 other nations who've read this book translated, and NOW THEY KNOW that America is after them. Asking about "why they hate us"? This book is IT, it is the answer! Can't wait to finish this spew of hatret.  Also, I would like to point out that Brzezinski's view of Russia's role has been always one-sided, his predictions gloom and doom. He is a former polac (from Poland) and it is obvious why he hates Russia, till this day. Do not think for one minute that these predictions about Russia are "genious" in any way, shape or form.  Other than that - fascinating reading so far 
 The soundtrack Crossroads was totally useless due to the fact that the main ending song was omitted.  It rendered the whole cd unsatisfactory and should not be called the orignal motion picture soundtrack because it is not... 
 I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because their customer service (communication and such) have been very good.  I purchased this bracelet a few months ago and (a few days ago) had the unfortunate experience as the previous reviewer. I was taking it off and it snapped in the middle.   Once you could see the insides, it was obviously not pure Sterling Silver as the "materials" portion indicates.  I will be returning this item for a new one (already gave my girl a matching one) and may not even wear it at all...  *very disappointing 
 In fact not good at all..  I really don't like Good Charlotte.. And I don't own this CD, my brother does.  Almost all the songs are about the singer feeling sorry for himself, whining about how miserable he is. And the lyrics are very, very simple.  "Hold on" is supposed to be a song against suicide, but I find it totally unbelievable, when theres a song on the CD Called "the day that I die", where he sings that the happiest of his life is the that he dies. And I think he mentions death in some other songs too. So maybe he is not that miserable, or "hold on" is just an attempt to gain more popularity and being heroic. It really makes no sense.  I'm giving this CD 1 star because I really think it's bad. Not because I think "real punk" and "classic rock" is the only good music, and you should buy that instead (that's just stupid). There are lot's of great alternatives to this cd. But there are also a lot of bands in this genre, that are almost as bad as Good Charlotte.  Comparing this to Blink 182 is insane. Blink 182 makes great melodies and clever lyrics 
 In my humble opinion, the real stars of this sorry sequal were the cars, e.g. the Corvair, Buscemi's Caddy and Cuervo's 1959 Buick.  How often do you get to see a '59 Buick, either in the movies or in real life 
 Two words -- No resolution.  Seriously, this graphic novel ends with no plot resolution at all.  There is such a great buildup with absolutely no payoff.  Do NOT waste your money on this.  The only redeeming factor is the decent artwork.  Beyond that, the storyline is atrocious 
 This book's purpose is to argue that Wal-mart is an evil empire.  Fishman throws in some positive facts to try and seem neutral, but throughout the book he shows his socialist stripes and lack of understanding of basic economic principals.  The sections of the book that I most enjoyed and found most interesting were the great in-depth anecdotes about companies that have a relationship with Wal-Mart.  I had trouble finishing this book because his diatribe against Wal-Mart becomes more intense near the end, but at the same time his arguments have so many gaping holes.  Those who understand basic economic principles will shake their head in disagreement many times as they turn the pages of this book.  Overall, I feel quite dismayed because I think he will be successful in convincing many uninformed readers that Wal-Mart's impact is more harmful than beneficial. 
 shaver is bulky, sideburn trimmer is not attached to shaver, cool skin additive is very difficult to use for a person with rheumatoid arthriris. I would have exchanged it for a different model except it is to difficult to repack and mail back 
 THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH GETTING. IT'S JUST A BLANK BOOK [...] YOU CAN WRITE AJOURNAL IN ANY BOOK ESPECIALLY A RINGED NOTEBOOK WHICH IS CHEAPER AND BETTER. YOU CAN STILL TAKE THE ADVICE (NOT ORIGINALLY HERS, WRITING JOURNAL AND WRITING 5 THINGS YOU ARE GREATFUL FOR) JUST DON'T WRITE IT IN THE BOOK THEY SELL YOU BECAUSE THEY HARDLY GIVE YOU ANY SPACE 
 i used this book in a university course, i got very little out of it.  it had handwavy explanations for almost every topic it discussed.   when i tried to actually use the material, i found it useless because it skipped all the details.   i had to spend hours on hours googling and wikiing to find information that the bok should have had 
 I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about high performance driving without the cost of going to a school, but roughly half of this book is just advertisement of Bob's driving school in Southern California. For example, on controlling skids, he talks very little about how to get out of a skid and then he begins on how you can learn more if you come to his driving school because the school has such and such equipments. There's even an entire chapter dedicated to how to graduate from his driving school. He also seems to be obssessed with his past glory, which he doesn't mind spending time to talk about. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE 
 This is the first book by Shaara I have read. And, if his other works are like this, it is also the last.    On the cover, J. Persico is quoted as saying Shaara makes "literature read like history and history read like literature."  He goes on to claim that Shaara brings the war to "pulsating life."  I have even read a review that claimed this book was better than Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front.    I must have been reading a different book.  The first chapter, The Replacement, is a great short story.  After reading it, I had hight expectations for the book.  Unfortunately, it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view.  And, the history reads like an 8th grade textbook.   His narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived.  They are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them.    After the dislocated short story of the first chapter, the book delves into a long-winded story of the flying aces, interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story.  It frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book.  Shaara doesn't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918's, when the Americans arrive, focusing, as I noted before, primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war. I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own.  Here, however, it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story. Or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the British or French perspective.   And, I have no particularly problem with him focusing on the American perspective on the war, but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry?  I suppose a smaller book doesn't sell as well.  For those interested in historical fiction, I would recommend Bernard Cornwall's work.  And, perhaps, Shaara can learn a bit from him 
 An expensive book with little meat. Whole chapters dedicated to basic electromagnetism. Nice if it was a primer on electromag but this is supposed to be a focused book. Buy  "Noise Reduction tech. in Electronic Systems" Henry W. Ott. Much better book for the money 
 I am not a negative person, however I do have some negative feelings about this book.  I have what I consider "moderate" sales experience, selling everything from shoes, to real estate, which is my current profession.  If you are looking for a book that gives you practical, applicable advice, this is not it.  It is more of a feel good, hey heres a few ideas that may help you in general type book. Basically a lot of mush.  I found myself having to sell my own self on even finishing the end of the book.  I made it, but my eyelids were heavy and I was totally uninspired.  I am truthfully surprised that this book has recieved such positive reviews.  In summary, it was a book of broad, unconnected ideas that will have little to no effect on actual sales performance or customer satisfaction 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
 While I agree with all the other reviews on how this book is EXCELLENT for learning the introduction (and some advanced) concepts and applications of Direct 3D it is severely lacking one thing: game programming mechanics.  Frank D. Luna has an awesome ability to teach Direct 3D in an easy to understand and fun way but this is not a book to buy if you want to learn how game systems and mechanics interface with direct 3d.  There is no game project nor is there any helpful information on animation/sound/or comprehensive explanation of DirectInput (though there is a really nice camera class you create in the book).  Anyway...I give this book 2 stars not because it lacks validity or helpful notes, as was stated earlier its really well organized and easy-to-understand.  But don't expect to come out of this book without any questions about D3D games because there is a lot that he doesnt cover.  I still recommend this book to anybody interested in graphics programming and back it up with full support in that respect 
 I'm a huge fan of Ted Dekkar, but lately I've noticed that his books have been lacking. Showdown was a wonderful read, and I was completely engrossed in it, thinking I would feel the same about SAINT I bought it. I think the most dissapointing about this book was that it was actually a sequel to Showdown, yet you don't know it till halfway through. I found this completely rediculous, and even though the story was somewhat interesting at times, it never really seemed to go anywhere...and never really ended either. There is never any true complete ending, and it leaves you feeling like you read a whole bunch of words instead of an actual story 
 I bought this thinking it would be for an introductory coach.... it is more on the rules and very high level.  for example the book reads - "make sure you get the right bat for the batter" and does not explain how to measure right bat height......same is true for the height of the tee...... disappointing.   I'm going to buy another book..... 
 Trying to figure out the point. Language is good...but content Zip. I normally don't put books down half way. Am very tempted to do it with this one. Can't believe this won an awar 
  Tired of all the hullaballoo surrounding Tolkien I finally purchased LOtR. I enjoy fantasy and tried to give it a fair shake but put the book down from boredom a quarter of the way through. I found myself rereading pages because my mind wasn't getting into his prose. There are better works out there, IMHO.  Everyone sings the praises of him so YOU might enjoy it, but I much prefer George Martin's series A Song of Ice and Fire 
    You know smart kids are passed off as nerds in school and then they become unhappy losers? I know it's sad, but, do you want your little one to turn out like that? Lose all confidence, then end up at some street corner asking for money? Since I doubt it, I highly do not recommend this problem.  [NOTE: By the way, I am an adult and I do not know some of these questions. Don't know how a 8-year-old would.]    YOUR LOCAL CRAZY MONKEY, Trevor Tankia 
 I was just a little confused when this cd came out a few years ago.  I bought it because well...it's Celine, and I adore her.  BUT...why did she release this cd besides to make some money during her absence?  I mean' C'mon!  Where's volume 2 or 3?  Are we going to get them, or are we just stuck with this volume 1 with VERY RANDOM songs on it?  If you're a Celine fan, get this cd to fill out your collection, but if you're not...don't waste your money.  If you want a Celine album, I would recommend All the Way: Decade of Hits, and One Heart 
 Rantings and usual rhetoric that defies logic or fairness. A total waste of time 
 it probably would appeal to a lot of people but was not of interest to me.  i gave it a go and then felt that it was all too familiar with an uninteresting and not too imaginative slant.  
 This book gives basic information on Bipolar Disorder - the physiology of it, the various medications available (and possible side effects), and some alternative/additional treatments.  I found the book to fall apart, however, when it came to their suggestions of how to make changes in your life to make recovery better/easier.  A person would have to live in an ideal life in order to put their suggestions into place to the degree they outline.  They presume that you have (or can get) family and friends who can/want to be a support system for you, and that you can take the time to just step back from regular life and focus on your recovery.  But, in real life, the people I know who share a BP diagnosis rarely have family or spouses open to taking on a significant supportive role, open to getting into counseling, etc.  Single parents - or parents in general - will find it difficult to put 90% of the authors' suggestions into their lives.  They also sometimes contradict themselves: they talk about the importance of removing big sources of stress in your life during your recovery - and then tell you not to quit your job or divorce your spouse or make any major decisions in your life.  Well, those *are* the big sources of stress in most people's lives.  The information is helpful (although much of it can be found on the Internet), the suggestions are too idealistic to be realistic.  Suggestions for those of us, the majority, who have no choice but to jump back into work and parenting and daily life following an episode would have been much more helpful 
 Horrible movie, only worth watching if you are a Jayne Mansfield or Phyllis Diller fan. Movie looks like it was cheaply filmed and only uses about 4 scenes in entire movie. However, if you like cartoons, than you might like this movie. The singer Laurie Berger is the funniest when she sings and dances her solo. Save your money for a fast food burger. 
 Solid action; terrible plot, dialog, and acting (by Hally Berry).  This movie proved to me once and for all time that Hally Berry is an god-awful actress.  At least Brosnan delivers his shoddy lines with poise - Berry seems almost more comfortable with the throw-away prose.    If you are dead-set on buying this movie also pick up a copy of "Catwomen" on DVD.  Why?  Use it to prime yourself for this movie - watch it before hand to set the bar low for Berry and then suddenly this movie will not seem so bad.  
 Like "Wittgenstein's Poker" this book turns a single event in the lives of two important philosophers into a full-length book.    Where one book concerned a possible fight, here it's a meeting which is believed by Stewart to have caused a painful conversion-epiphany in Leibniz, the conservative courtier. Both works are lively, good reads, but that's where the similarity ends.  While "Wittgenstein's Poker," at least in the main, gets analytical philosophy, logical positivism, and ordinary language philosophy right, Stewart makes quite a mess of Leibniz. In fact, while he has an advanced degree in philosophy, he seems to have a very limited understanding of either of his subject's main works.  And, unfortunately, what he does seem to get right, he feels the need to explain by the main thesis of his book--that Leibniz was a closet Spinozist for most of his life and only pretended to disagree with him to protect his status.    I can't go into the details of these errors in a brief review of this type, but Leibniz's understanding of necessity was very different from Spinoza's and Stewart's limited understanding of modal logic has produced a hash, rather than anything coherent out of Leibniz's "best of all possible worlds" claim (which, while it may be difficult to believe, can at least be made coherent if one understands the notion of possible worlds in the manner of that philosopher).  Stewart's botching of Leibniz is clear and will be fairly obvious to students of that philosopher's works, but his take on Spinoza (on whom I wrote my own Ph.D. thesis) is hazier and, as a result, arguably not so awful.  I do think, though, that Spinoza's notions of "salvation" and intuitive knowledge can only be made to  jibe with this book after considerable analysis and explication--very little of which can be found here.  At any rate, I learned a good deal about the life, times and psychological make-up of these men, for which I'm grateful to the author 
 This guy is the biggest poser.  The only people that gave him good reviews were his family members or friends.  This guy really sucks 
 I was forced to read this in 10th grade but could hardly bear reading it.  Initially, I'd had high hopes for it, because we'd read such intelligent, intriguing novels earlier in the year, including "Lord of the Flies" and "Catcher in the Rye."  But what a bore it was! Old Santiago goes out to fish, hoping to catch the "big one" (drawing on the innate male desire to always catch the best, biggest thing.."that must mean I'm macho, a real man!"), blah blah blah, can't catch anything, blah blah blah, and when he finally catches the big one, it is eaten by sharks. The stupidest book ever. I've never been a Hemingway fan, and this book steered me further away from his work.  A pathetic book by a pathetic man 
 I think Eye of the Needle, at least as the film tells the story, suffers from a common problem I have seen in a lot of "action thrillers":  poor character development.  Why should we care about these characters one way or the other?  Instead we have a modicum of action and violence, a dose of beautiful ocean scenery, and lovemaking.  There was not much complexity or discernment in any of the characters. Donald Sutherland simply looks depressed, as a serious actor might be if he found himself wasting his time making a bad film.  Alfred Hitchcock did a much better film along the same lines with "The 39 Steps". 
 Like others, I picked this book up after reading several in the No. 1 Ladies...series.  No comparison.  The story is in the first line on page one and the last three pages of the book.  I just don't understand the rest of this book.  Isabel never even asked the key question to the whole "mystery" until it slapped her in her silly face.  The mystery for me is - what is the Sunday Philosophy Club, and what in the world does it have to do with this book?  I'm sorry I spent the time on this - there are important books to be read 
 As an Alice in Wonderland collector, it was fun to have something new, but it is such nonesense, it will just sit in my collection 
 ***Spoilers Ahead***  Towards the end of the book I was absolutly positive there HAD to be another installment in the series because it kept going with no resolution in sight.   Unfortunatly, I was wrong.  In a typically Mercedes Lackey move the book goes on and on and on, following the characters practically day by day, hour by hour, minute by minute and then ends abruptly.   I honestly felt there was no point to most of what I read. It seemed that half of the book was spent following Kellen as he travelled from place to place and back again while he whined over how ruthless he was becoming. Then we spent another good portion of the book reading about Savilla torturing various creatures and walking around naked. And finally, Jermayan, who also seemed to spend half his time just travelling back and forth between cities and camps and so forth. Oh, and let's not foget Cilarnen, who spend most of the book holed up in one place of another while he fiddles around with all his new books and equipment.  Then we get to the end, the final battle, the culmination of all our effort in reading through hundreds of pages of character and plot development....and they wrap it up in MAYBE 30 pages.   There was absolutly no resolution in my mind. It was like the ending was simply an after though: "Oh, yeah, and the good guys win. The end."   The demons are supposed to be a mighty and powerful race but they go down seemingly without a fight. To be honest, I was more intrugued by Kellen and Shalkan fighting the stone mastiffs than I was about the final battle. It was just way to easy, convenient, and stereotypical to be enjoyable.  To end the story, of course, there had to be the relationship resolution. I wasn't bying these flimsy relastionships from the beginning, it was just very fast, very forced and very out of place. So Jermayan gets Idalia....sort of but it was the relationship between Kellen and Vestakia that really got me. They spent most of the trilogy avoiding each other yet somehow manage to fall in love and then at the very end: "Oh, by the way, we can have sex now. I love you."   In all, it was disappointing. Many questions weren't answered and they left a lot of loose threads hanging in their hurry to wrap it all up. If they hadn't spent almost the entire book focusing on the pointless they could have made so much more of it 
 The author definitely sounds like she knows all about javascript, but there doesn't seem to be a real emphasis on teaching for a "learning" book.  The first couple chapters are a dry overview of the nuts and bolts of javascript, if you've have programming experience this will be familiar.  After that the book goes into broader topics, but doesn't do much in the way of teaching.  More examples, and more specifics would've been helpful.    I wouldn't recommend this book, there has to be a better introductory javascript book on the market 
 I owned this and threw it out recently. It was an embarassment. Do not buy it. If you must see it, visit your library. The only thing that's good about this is the descriptions of fashion personality types, which is a fun read. Other than that, save your money and buy the Lucky Manual or Pocket Stylist instead. 
 I bought this hoping that I would be able to easily identify the native shrubs and vines on my property, but it is not very helpful.  It is very difficult to use for someone not trained in botany.  I should know, as my training is in aquatic biology and zoology.  Even with my biology background, I have not found it very useful so the identification part of the title is very misleading.  Also, there appears to be no rhyme or reason as to how the plants are categorized.  I was hoping this would be more like Taylor's guides to trees, shrubs, etc. with pictures that then refer to a description, but it wasn't

 I was disappointed by this toothbrush holder after putting it to use for just one day - any drops of water that run down the side of the holder or end up around the bottom edge due to splashing/runoff from the bathroom sink immediately seem to trigger the bottom of the holder to rust! I tried to keep the splashing to a minimum but this thing started leaving a rust-ring on my bathroom counter within a couple days. I still use it since it's a nice-looking & easily cleaned toothbrush holder but I keep a coaster under it to protect the sink/counter. I wish I could give it more stars since I love the look & functionality of it but I have to give it only 2 stars since I think making it rust-proof is only common sense for something that sits next to your sink. I wonder if all the steeltek "stainless-steel" products rust so easily??

 I got this CD player because I thought sony was a good company, plus I liked the look of it. But after just 5 months after purchase, and not even using it that often, it has already broken. I paid about 40 dollars for this CD player, so I am very disappointed. If I were you, I would buy a different CD player 
 The nineties were a pivotal era for the software industry. The masses began to embrace computers while the industry responded by making personal computers more and more useful and affordable to the average person. The proliferation of access to more powerful computers spurred the growth of the Internet toward a critical mass. These mutually supporting trends snowballed into a genuine cultural transformation.  In the marketplace, the demands for PC hardware and software were growing at astonishing rates. Thousands of software startups were vying to stake out the largest territories on the new frontier. Powerful multinational corporations were competing ruthlessly to dominate enormous mass markets.  The general character of all this competition was that of a race. Competitors raced to create the most significant technological advantages for customers, particularly those features most complicated and difficult to mimic. By consistently outpacing the competition, one could secure a privileged position as front runner. One could retain this privilege only by continuing to improve products at least as quickly as any challenger. Enormous fortunes were won and lost in this race, and it affected virtually everyone involved in the creation of software.   During this era, most software managers were under tremendous pressure to optimize immediate construction speed. Teams heroically sprinted to the finish line, the next product delivery date, only to be told that the race was not really over, that they must immediately start sprinting again. Only a few mature organizations realized that they were actually running a marathon.  Before the dust settled, the average complexity of a marketable software application was to increase a hundredfold. Unfortunately, a majority of software professionals were not equipped to deal with such complex systems. They failed to realize that beyond a certain degree of complexity formal architecture and design methods become indispensible. They naïvely elevated construction speed above all other considerations. Crippled by this self-defeating objective, many teams were driven to the breaking point. The rate of project failure grew rapidly. Poor working conditions were widespread. Engineers were disillusioned and discouraged. The most capable managers resigned themselves to dutifully wasting resources in order to give the outward appearance of construction progress while design work went on behind the scenes, almost secretly.  Enter Steve McConnell's "Rapid Development." It set out to address what many thought to be the most pressing software development problem of its day, speed. There were already dozens of tools and methods on the market that promised to increase development speed. These were deemed "rapid application development (RAD)" tools and methods. But they had all failed to deliver. The software industry was still desperately searching for a silver bullet. It was the perfect time for a new book on the subject, especially one granted legitimacy by Microsoft Press. (Because of Microsoft's superlative success during those difficult times, popular opinion held that they were the ultimate authority on how to develop software. Despite a cynical attitude that prevailed among many engineers, books backed by Microsoft were generally taken seriously.)  This book accomplished a lot of good in its day. It stimulated the reader's thinking along the right lines. It said, in effect, "If you want to work faster, you will need more than motivational speeches, `performance' awards, gadgets, and quick-fix schemes. You will need to devote real mental energy to the problem." That was a message that most managers desperately needed to hear, and most developers applauded. If you were a typical developer, this was a great book to recommend to your manager.   But now it is the year 2007. In the full light of day, this book's charlatanism seems obvious. It is gushing with camaraderie with the poor, overworked developer. While denouncing the silver bullet syndrome prevalent at that time, it proffers its own magic pill. It says, in effect, "My friends, this book contains the secret elixir of speed."   In essence, "Rapid Development" asserts that, although RAD tools and quick-fix techniques alone do not work, simply choosing the appropriate "best practices" for your project will solve all your problems. Everything comes down to avoiding a few simple mistakes. Like the silver bullets it purports to replace, it neglects to mention the intricacies of architecture and design to be mastered and the creative talent to be developed. Instead of endeavoring to teach the abstract principles relevant to software development efficiency, it bombards the reader with inane diagrams and fictitious scenarios involving companies with cute names.  Not surprisingly, from the outset, McConnell tags development speed as the essential problem of the software industry. But, even by his own definition, so-called rapid development is a chimera. In reality, the software market creates specific windows of opportunity with particular success requirements. There can be no absolute standard against which to quantify raw speed independent of other factors. The proper goal is not simply developing software quickly, it is outpacing competitors in terms of customer satisfaction gained versus time, and doing so consistently over the course of many releases. Time to market is only relevant to planning in specific cases. It cannot be abstracted and considered in a vacuum. What software teams need is not speed but long-term efficiency, and control leading to consistent predictability. The scourge of the industry in the mid nineties was the naïve belief that the race is won or lost by lines of code per day. By framing the problem in terms of construction speed, this book only helped to perpetuate that error.  We cannot avoid the fact that software engineering is a highly complex and creative endeavor. It requires significant knowledge, skill, and talent. In the immature industry of the nineties, many professionals were not properly equipped for their jobs. In particular, a much deeper theoretical foundation for architecture and design was needed. To some extent this is still true today. Such knowledge and the skill of applying it must be painstakingly gained through in-depth study or formal training. It cannot be acquired as McConnell suggests, by casually reading fictitious scenarios and contemplating "best practices" while waiting in airports.  On the whole, "Rapid Development" comes across as a high-pressure sales pitch for the concept of "best practices." The fundamental premise behind this concept is that software is like fast food. If we create a streamlined process and train our teams to observe certain rules, we can churn out software products like hamburgers off an assembly line. This is the antithesis of a proper conceptual approach. The common idea that unites "best practices" and fast food is that of economizing by employing uncreative and under-educated labor. Perhaps, in a labor market with a dearth of qualified engineers, such drastic measures are required. But we must not forget that they are interim measures. As long as the public wants great software, we cannot really reduce the demand for good engineers by employing "best practices." Everyone will simply have to wait until the supply catches up with the demand. In the mean time, perhaps we ought to avoid chasing away the best engineers we already have and discouraging newcomers.  Even today this book is not completely worthless. There are a few useful pieces of hard data, though they merely support what seasoned software professionals already know by experience. And a talented young engineer with good analytical skills may be able to abstract some of the important principles of software engineering success from the "case histories" and their discussions. 
 after get shorty, e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again, with this single-minded purpose focused, e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty. and he was right again, it was bought and made into a movie again, but pathetically, a horrible one compared to get shorty. the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind. i simply failed to find there's any interest in reading this going nowhere story. it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie, with all the bore-to-death script, dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap. how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles, especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty'? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose'? and at every corner of los angeles, every table in any restaurant, almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer'? and you have to ask yourself: since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer, even a director in person? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are? yeah, maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show? give me a break! this book, from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer, so shallow and so superficious! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in 
 It usually takes me about a week or two to get through a paperback. I've been  struggling to read this every night in bed for two months. It's boring and uninteresting. I quit 
 This book has overlooked the role of alternative therapies such as acupuncture and herbology in  the treatment of Hepatitis C.  Additionally, they do not even mention the wonder herb, milk thistle. They only put  negative connotations to anything that isn't good-old-US approved.  The  chapters on emotional and nutritional care are far from complete as they  lack depth and advocate only a small fraction of what is available to those  who suffer.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 I was tempted to give this book two stars because the topic is excellent, however Berger falls short of the mark. The book is aimed at beginners (quote: "A complete discussion of <X> would quickly drive all but the most dedicated readers into 'geek overload', so I'll end my discussion here."), but fails in that endevour by providing a patchy and incoherent text. The book is sprinkled with insights from "In the Trenches" which makes you doubt that he's actually ever been there 
  For some reason I do remember seeing this film as a kid, and I thought it was great.  But now, seeing it again, I don't know, I think it's really kinda dumb.  I can't remember what the appeal was back then.  Maybe it was because I thought Carol Kane was hot. And Gene Wilder was still kinda popular at that time.    Try watching this again, believe me, it's not so great.  I should have rented this dumb thing first.  
 This book was one of the worst books I have ever read.  The characters are lifeless and the plot is unrealistic.  Without giving away too much of the book, lets just say the author does not have a firm understanding of ballistics or basic law enforcement procedures 
 I expected information about design, but this is just a self serving "I am good at what I do" book. I am sure he is good but there is little or no information about how to actually desigh furniture. No proportions, no instruction except make your mistakes on paper by sketching first. A waste of good money. 
 This book and every other book on self help topics are endless rephrasings of Jesus statement - " Ask and you shall receive ". Why we read these books? Because we are in need. And IF WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF OUR NEED IS THIS SAME NEED WE SHALL RECEIVE. We are always what we are conscious of. That's so simple like that. When I AM conscious of being rich, I AM rich in that very moment. In SPIRIT and so, IN TRUTH, I AM rich. That's all. The proof that I am rich is my total joy and gratefulness. Money in my bank account will materialize soon after, but, first, money must be a fact in spirit. The same with health, relationships, etc. Try this: suppose you are feeling depressed and anxious. Be conscious you are the most happiest person in the world. Right now. Feel  happy beyond your wildest dreams. Not that you will be, but that YOU ARE NOW. And you are. That's all. So, feel you are rich right now. And you are. Apparent money will appear soon in your bank. Ask IS receive. But asking in the conscious of the need is receive the... need - the very thing one is conscious of. Each new book you read about materializing your desires is a proof that you are conscious of your needs and that is your asking and what you receive. This is so simple that you need to be as a little child to believe 
 I picked up this book expecting to gain some new insights about the bleeding edge of scientific research, string theory, and model-building, but found it unbelievably tedious, self-congratulatory, and self-absorbed. There may be little doubt that author Lisa Randall is a brilliant physicist, but her explanations of the last 100 years of science and her theories are muddled and poorly written. I found myself longing for a writer such as Bill Bryson to explain half of these theories. In addition, one of most annoying features of this book is the way Randall tries to disguise her inability to explain advanced physics in straightforward terms that would appeal to the lay reader by starting each chapter with a pop culture reference, usually a lyric from a band such as Metallica, as if such a reference will be enough to goose the reader awake and take interest in the next muddled exposition. She even has footnotes that explain the American term "runway" is translated as "catwalk" in the United Kingdom -- oh, thank you, Ms. Randall, for such elucidation! Why not make this book more interesting and readable with a more engaging style that explains these fascinating theories in a clearer manner? Not to give away the ending, but many of these theories about extra dimensions cannot even be proven unless the universe demonstrates another massive outburst of energy almost equivalent to the Big Bang 
 I have gotten better results with Sterlingtek batteries for a fraction of the price...like less the $15 shipped

 This is a good phone, except it has one major flaw which makes it unusable. First off, a minor flaw is that it is hard to pick up the reciever as it is locked in there, I don't like that. Another flaw is that while you are picking up and putting back the phone, it makes a VERY high and LOUD screaming pitch. This makes it almost deafening for someone on another phone in the house. This phone will be going back ASAP because it is unusable. Stay away from this phone at all costs 
 I woke up repeatedly in the night with more pain that the Plantars Faciitis was giving me for the following reasons:  -The front part of the sock device is extremely narrow.  I don't have wide feet, but the pointy ends crowded by toes and caused cramps that I had to adjust for constantly.  Could never get used to it.  -The strap around the ankle was too stiff and chaffed.  Took forever to find the right tightness that didn't cause my feet to swell painfully in the night while not being so loose that it moved and chafed horribly.    -Honestly, even wearing a hard plastic brace was easier for me to sleep with.  A simple strap that supported the arch and wrapped over the instep has been the most effective, along with faithfully wearing the arch supports during the day.  Don't waste your money 
 I liked the book well enough to read past the first 100 pages, and I did enjoy the Scholar's Tale, but beyond that this book really failed to satisfy.  I don't want to give away any details, but I will say that all of the excitement and mystery surrounding the Shrike is NOT satisfied at all by the end of this book.  Presumably it's wrapped in in the next book but I found myself not interested in slogging through more of Simmons's half-baked plot to reach satisfaction.  I felt cheated 
 Since Mr. Oord felt compelled to offer multiple reviews (see July 14,2002 entry), though I wasn't so compelled, here goes my single review. *As a Wesleyan, this book is very disturbing.*  The False Premise of this book and much of Openism: God's Love is Paramount Attribute under which all other Divine Attributes are Subordinate. Or to use one of their illustrations: God's Love is like Mt Kilimanjaro, the highest stand-alone mountain on earth. While the Lord Himself is represented as the Continent of Africa with its many wonderful attributes and qualities, nothing can match the stature of the majestic Mt. Kilimanjaro rising above the Tanzanian plain, dominating the otherwise flat terrain and adding Massive Contour to the topography.  While a nice sentiment, and without by any means downplaying the Wonder and Magnificence and Eternal, Omni-nature of Agape' as fully displayed on the Old Rugged Cross and the movie Passion of the Christ, sympathizers with this misguided view need to read the ENTIRE BIBLE to get its take on things.  What's the harm/danger in overemphasizing God's Love? Simply this. It subtly UNDER-emphasizes God's other equally inherent Attributes like HOLY, PERFECT, OMNIPRESCIENT, JUSTICE, GOOD,RIGHTEOUSNESS, and so on. God of course is portrayed in the Bible as Whole Being, not mere sum of Attributes or as the Deity Who is LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. What does Isaiah 6 and Rev. 4 say for emphasis? HOLY, HOLY, HOLY.   This tells us God is Love, yes. But HOLY-LOVE. GOOD-LOVE. JUST-LOVE. RIGHTEOUS-LOVE. And so on.  Ever wonder why many Open Theists like these authors are either Annihilationists or non-eternal Hell believers? It's because their unbiblical emphasis on Love excludes God's WRATH on Jesus-rejectors. They can't imagine their loving God enforcing a literal, conscious, bodily, tormentive ETERNAL existence of the lost (for some of these openists, Universal Salvation is the only logical outgrowth to their Love-theology: for them, none will be ultimately lost).  Despising and rejecting God's Love, if left unpunished with no divinely imposed just consequence renders the notion of God's Holy-Love into little more than sappy sentiment. That's why the Cross and Blood of Christ is so graphic: not just Holy-Love for the sinner, but Holy-Hate/Wrath for sin. Jesus the Innocent got the Wrath so we the Guilty get the Wreath (by Grace via Repentant Faith alone). Those who forfeit the Wreath are left with the Wrath.  See Wesley's commentary on Romans for insight.  Let Scripture settle the matter decisively and conclusively. If they're going to quote John 3:16, at least it should be in context of John 3:17-18 and 3:36  For God so loved the world that He gave His Only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him would not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes is not condemned; but whoever doesn't believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the Name of the One and Only Son of God..Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever disobeys the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains (just as eternal) on him.  Read Revelation about the tormentive, day & night, 'forever and ever' nature of the hell which Jesus-rejectors impose on themselves by God's Holy-Wrath (Holy-Love wilfully spurned/blasphemed).  If Hell is not eternal, neither is Heaven since the same Greek duration descriptor is used for both:  Matt.25:46 "these (goats) shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous (sheep) into life eternal."   
 I picked this book up from a local bookstore because it was flagged with a "recommondation" tag, and I've discovered some pretty great authors following the recommendations there.  Unfortunately, this one was a bust.  After reading the first 50 pages or so, I noticed the pull quote on the cover that announces "Swordspoint has an unforgettable opening and just gets better from there."  In all honesty, I couldn't really remember how the book began, and I'd been reading it for less than an hour.  There are two main problems with this "historical fantasy" work.  The first is the workmanlike prose.  Characters always speak with adverbs tacked on to force the tone.  Here's a quick recap of one such conversation that covers about five paragraphs of text thanks to the long stretches of dialog:  xxxxxx she said fondly.  xxxxxx said Michael with an impish grin.  xxxxxx the duchess said dryly.  xxxxxx Lady Godwin said firmly.  xxxxxx the duchess was saying consolingly. Now, everything is serviceable enough -- nice, adjective-laden descriptions, a metaphor here and there, but there's not a lot of creativity in the author's style.  After a while, it feels like reading a newspaper article.  The second problem is the plot.  The author was aiming for a kind of "Les Liasons Dangereuses," with lots of court intrigue and subtle positioning in the complex fight for political power.  But to pull that off, you really need some kind of mystery or subterfuge that keeps the reader guessing, or at least holds his/her interest.  There's really none of that in Swordspoint... the "court intrigue" is incredibly blunt, more like a daytime soap than a good movie 
 I bought this book soon after we adopted our daughter.  I found the writing style to be convoluted and precocious, much like the way children speak in contemporary movies (adult words from a child's mouth).  Sorry, not a fan.  We are still looking for a book that addresses an open, domestic adoption that can speak to children, not adults 
 Too bad for this guy, can't make much money off the China Threat scare these days. One of many retards who weren't very focused on the real threat back in pre 9/11 2001 
 Not The Original Film. Doesn't have the original disco scene with "I like the night life" song. THEY COMPLETELY RUINED THE MOVIE 
 I mean, come on. A blind golfer? I thought it was an intruiging premise, too, until I tried to hit balls with my eyes closed. I'm a 2-handicapper, and I was completely hapless. So forgive me if my suspension of disbelief came crashing down.   That said, Cullen writes a pleasant, if completely farfetched tale, with likeable characters. However, I thought the best parts of the book had nothing to do with golf. The subplot involving the mentally ill father was actually more interesting, believable and touching, and the best part of the book was a short bit about Allegheny men and their pickup trucks.   
 Ya. it had a pretty naked chick in it. but man it was booooring. definitely one for a very specialised marke 
 The hullabaloo surrounding the book will lead one to believe that this is an epitome of all adventure/suspense stories. In reality, the book is nothing but a wanderings of a disturbed mind, disillusioned with life and suffering from abnormalities of mind - so common among soldiers after attending a bloody war. Those readers who praise the book sky-high must have some ulterior motive in mind; otherwise this is a shoddy piece of work and written obviously with a film script in mind rather than a book, which anyways what Hilton was, scriptwriter in Hollywood!  His other tiny book  Goodbye Mr. Chips is a better read and doesn't pretend to be something else or is it we who label a book. No wonder Lost Horizon is out of print and should remain so. I don't blame the writer as much as the so-called critics, readers and other writers for whom the world begins in Western Europe and ends in North America. A very myopic view!    
 I have read hundreds of true crime books and I followed the story of Lori Hacking in the news very closely.  So when I was on vacation and was looking for a book to read on the airplane, I was happy to see that a book had been written about Lori's story.  I am now very disappointed that I did not have the benefit of Amazon's customer reviews before wasting my money on this book.  The author did not talk to any family members (save maybe Paul, who had one or two quotes in the entire book).  The book was written from a reporter's perspective and added no detail that I had not already read in news reports when the story was unfolding several years ago.  He even quoted the National Enquirer.  Here are some quotes from this book:  "While Winslow had his scoop, and would lead others to the story, the Deseret Morning News held an edge.  The paper, which had been founded by Brigham Young, would make the playing field uneven for other news outlets working the story.  Throughout coverage of the case, journalists from the Deseret Morning News got access to family members of Lori and Mark Hacking when other news outlets did not.  Why should journalists from the old Deseret News and Church-owned KSL get all the leads?" (p. 108)  "The AP reporter hadn't paid much attention to the missing persons story out of City Creek Canyon when it first broke.  After all, it was local and would be of only passing interest to the wire service clients who subscribed at radio and television stations and newspapers across Utah, much less the ones on the national wire.  But word travels fast among AP clients, and the wire service's Utah office learned that the North Carolina television station had broken a major story on the Hacking disappearance.  The AP reporter was now assigned full time to the story as the AP moved the item." (p. 133).  "Network television producers and guest bookers have a power that print journalists envy.  The lure of the camera, the desire to appear on national television, boils under the surface of a surprising number of ordinary citizens. . . .  But three outlets had an edge, and they covered both print and electronic news.  The Church-owned Deseret Morning News and KSL radio and television often managed to beat the competition, both in print and on the air." (p. 143-144).  "The editorial showed how out of touch the hierarchy of The Salt Lake Tribune had become in its ignorance of how major media work.  Worse, it demonstrated a shallow view fired by a desire of city fathers to manipulate the image of the city.  Members of the national media laughed when they read it and e-mailed it to their home offices, who laughed as well." (p. 149)  "Money is a lawyer's curse and blessing.  The curse is simple:  If there is a Hell, surely some of them will find their particular circle to roast on for defending their clients who paid them.  The blessing is equally simple:  They will live well, eat well, drink well, and have the most articulate friends around until that day comes and they face the Devil himself." (p. 153).  Anyone who writes true crime books should realize that the American system of justice includes the Constitutional right to an attorney for all accused of a felony, and to compare a defense attorney to the Devil for doing his or her job is ridiculous coming from a true-crime author.  The portion of the book describing the weeks when the police were digging through the landfill was torturous:  Page 172: "Tedium quickly became the norm, yet once in a while the search would stop as cops would walk over to look in the pit that had been dug.  When that happened, reporters scrambled, knowing only that the cops had broken the routine and were doing something different.  Maybe that meant they had found something.  The journalists sitting along the road joked among themselves that they were stationed in a media version of summer camp, although a smelly one.  Some brought lawn chairs, chips, cookies, and sodas."  For crying out loud.  It was at this part of the book that I began rolling my eyes on a regular basis at the absurdity of this story and the wonder that any publisher would accept it.  I try not to criticize a book without reading the entire thing, and because I was trapped on an airplane with nothing else to do, I finished this one.  It never got any better.  I cannot say that a news reporter would not find this book interesting, but I can certainly say that no one else will.  The story of Lori Hacking broke my heart.  I only hope that a really good author (Jerry Bledsoe, Carlton Stowers, Ann Rule, Charles Bosworth) will do us all a favor and tell Lori's story the way it should be told.  I would recommend to anyone "A Killer Among Us" by Charles Bosworth, Jr. -- a story about a husband who hired someone to kill his 28-year-old wife and the mother of his 4 children, Elizabeth DeCaro.  That book will make you cry, and you will feel the pain of each family member because Bosworth brings you inside each person's heart.  Elizabeth's memory was done justice by Bosworth, and I only hope that someday we can say the same for Lori 
 I was so offended with this book. I agree with Bruce in regards to the conservatives and how they shape our image. But to put blame on the activist and the more eccentric gay people is just ridiculous.  I was both an activist and eccentric and let me tell you I fought for my rights every day of my life.  I am proud of this struggle because I never compromised myself to fit in and appear normal....and I know my example has played a small part in changing this world for the better.  Those so called mainstream and normal gays are enjoying life because of people like me.  We fought the fight while they sat back and pasted judgment...how dare they.  The reason the activist and eccentric gays appear to shape the gay image is because they are the brave souls! If you want the world to know that we all aren't that way then get your normal, mainstream ass out of the closet and do your part.....how can you expect the people to know that not every one gay is eccentric and an activist if you guys are always hiding behind closed doors in fear. In my opinion you normal wannabees are the real threat to gay freedom 
 I remember really liking this album when it was first released, even though I could tell it was not in the same league as The Real Thing or Angel Dust. Listening to the album now, I realise it is by far the worst FNM album since Mike Patton joined. The whole album feels very rushed, it has a sparse, raw sound, very different to Angel Dust's polish. The music is generally very simple with many tracks sounding like B-sides and lacks the consistent melodiousness and sense of rhythm of their previous two classic albums.   It was a shame to see guitarist Jim Martin depart. He had an unmistakable style and crunching guitar sound and was an integral part of FNM's style and make up. However, being replaced (for a short time anyway) by Trey Spruance is no bad thing - anyone familiar with his work with Mr Bungle will know he is a genius with a guitar and his work here on King For A Day is excellent, it's just a shame that the material he has to work with is largely uninspired.  How ironic then that on such a disappointing album, FNM produce one of their greatest ever tracks - the title track is pure genius, full of the care and effort, rhythm and melodiousness FNM were famous for. Beginning with a great bass riff and acoustic strum, it is soon joined by a gentle female voice effect and simple minor piano scale and then brilliantly builds into a tour de force of percussion and guitar work before cleverly returning to the gentle acoustic sounds of the intro where it carefully takes 2 and a half minutes to wind down beautifully - this is FNM as you'd expect them. Another track that deserves special mention is Cuckoo or Caca, a great metal piece with excellent percussion and keyboards and crazy vocals. It's scorching and funy and another reminder of the greatness FNM once held in abundance.  It's just a shame that these moments of inspiration are surrounded by so much surprising blandness (Caralho Voador, Take This Bottle, The Last To Know) and 2nd rate metal (Ugly In The Morning, What A day, Get Out). Star A.D. could have been vintage FNM but in the end falls flat, Evidence starts off interestingly enough but soon gets boring and metal tracks like Ricochet, The Gentle Art Of Making enemies and Digging The Grave are simple and sound like what most student bands are writing. However, the album does end on another note of vintage FNM - Just A Man is funny and catchy with Patton having fun doing his Tom Jones impression and the inclusion of a gospel choir at the end is inspired - you find yourself not wanting it to end.  Patton's vocals throughout the album are still amazing but should be accompanying much better material and you can't help but feel he was a little bored here - I think his heart always really lay with the far superior Mr Bungle, where he really shone and where his voice was absolutely perfect for the complex and avant garde material.  I suppose it's not surprising that King For A Day is a largely empty affair, the departure of Jim Martin and the diminished presence of Roddy Bottum at rehearsals meant that FNM's original chemistry and resources were sadly lacking and so were unable to achieve what they once had been able to. It's really an album for Faith No More fans, it's certainly no classic despite some classic material and I feel it was the beginning of the end for FNM, they would improve with their next album, Album Of The Year - but only marginally. 
 This book was immensly boring. I feel utterly stupid for having wasted my time reading this blithering mass of mindless jargon. This mystery did NOT keep me on the edge of my seat like it should have. The characters were poorly described and muh! What a waste! I'm just sorry that I couldn't choose to give negative stars 
 This book is chock full of hatred and inaccuracies. I was forced to read this book for a class and was disgusted from page one. How a teacher can assign this horror for a diversity class is beyond me. If you want indoctrination, then by all means read this nonsense. 
 this machined worked well. It was quick, until today We tried to use our Rancilio Espresso Machine this morning and it would not heat.  I am reserving judgement as to whether I will be able to get this thing repaired under some kind of warranty.    
 This CD is okay the first few times you listen to it, but it will grate on you by the 5th time. Some of the songs sound hillibilly and twangy, sing about topics that are not of special interest to kids, don't rhyme or are catchy, and don't teach anything 
 Derrida, who passed away on Oct 10 2004. His last thoughts were to his dearly departed friend, Giles de Leuze. Most of you know that the Oxford philosophical committee wanted to reject him for an honorary award, because they considered his "work" "useless". It is precisely because of Derrida that one was able to question and in this subtle work he traces the steps of "Igmar", who was a religious fanatic who existed in 700 AD with a large following in Persia. Devotees were said to wrap used loin clothes around their head and weep to an ancient statue which was later discovered to be a sign post. 
 This latest translation of the Chinese Taoist Classic is a dry and lifeless specimen, not surprising from a man whose translation of the I Ching was praised for "having no truck with 'timeless wisdom.'" (back cover blurb).  This volume's claim to fame, beyond its slim and attractive appearance, is the complete translation of Wang Bi, a 23 year old commentator from 3rd century CE China.  To determine whether this translation is for you, you should know that Wang Bi had a strong inclination toward political interpretation, a proclivity probably due to the "high official status and prestige" of his family and their role in government and politics [p. 9], a trend furthered by his great-uncle's "Treatise on Keeping One's Person Safe"-which begins by making government secure [p. 10].  (Now there's a Chinese virtue, eh?)  Consider also Wang Bi's answer as to why Confucius never spoke of nothingness while Lao Tzu spoke of it incessantly (as the Mother of the Ten Thousand Things etc.):  "The Sage [Confucius] embodied nothingness so he also knew that it could not be explained in words....Master Lao...constantly discussed nothingness...for what he said about it always fell short [p. 12]."   Now if you believe that someone who could say that actually knew anything firsthand about the Tao, then this book is for you.  And if you are interested in Wang Bi, see Ellen Chen's superb translation/commentary which puts it in perspective.  Otherwise, this is a book on Te-social virtue-where the scholarship is impeccable and the feeling is weak.  And that's the Way it is 
 My main interest in reading the book was for the information about the Nazi fascination with the Occult.  I was hoping for something as stimulating as Mel Gordon's HANUSSEN: HITLER'S JEWISH CLAIRVOYANT.  I was greatly disappointed.  Christopher Hale's HIMMLER'S CRUSADE doesn't really deliver what it promises.  Hale basically pooh-poohs anything connected with the occult, asserts that only Himmler took such notions seriously (but was indulged by those seeking favors from him) and then moves on to other matters.  The book draws no real conclusion other than "Nazis were evil," which it pounds repeatedly throughout the book.  (I think I knew that before I even started reading the book.)  Hale never seems to be sure of exactly which story he is telling.  For a while it seems as though the book is about Schaeffer, who led the expedition, then toward the end, it drops him altogether and starts giving detailed biographical information about other members of the expedition (and the people with whom THEY interacted).   The author goes off on lots of tangents, giving unessential details about minor figures and events that had little bearing on the main story.  After having invested several weeks in reading the book, I am not sure what the point of it was.    The most interesting parts of the book were those that took place in Tibet, but the trip to Tibet actually takes up only about half the book.  The rest is a long-winded recounting of the rise and fall of Nazism.  It seems to me that here we have yet another book written by someone completely lacking a literary sensibility.  The author, Christopher Hale, is a British TV documentarist.  This book is an appendix to his TV show.  I found it very difficult reading.  In addition to its lack of focus, I just don't think Hale is very comfortable with the printed word.  There are pages and pages wherein it seems he is giving verbal descriptions of documentary film footage.  Perhaps his TV show was interesting, but the book was a chore to read.  In addition, the author has this maddening habit of inserting inflammatory opinions into his narrative, apropos of nothing and lacking supporting evidence.  Several times throughout the book, the author, a Briton, makes outlandish parallels between America and Nazi Germany, which he doesn't bother to back up (because he can't).  Perhaps one can get away with this in a TV documentary, but not in a book, where the reader can back up and say, "Wait a minute.  That's a bunch of crap.  Where is the evidence are you basing that statement on?"    The book is also rife with typographical errors (some of them giving an unintentional double entendre when for example "role" is spelled "roll") and misusages of words.  It appears to have not been edited at all.  I give this book one and a half stars, but let's round it off to two just for the research the author has done.  (His bibliography is probably of a lot more use than the book.)  I just wish he had been able to put all this research into a more coherent form and told it in a way that was more comprehensible and more interesting 
 In my opinion, the interesting parts of this story were the travels themselves and the relationship between the brothers.  The dull parts were when Franz would indulge himself, his escapades and "his" Annie.  Hopefully, the story worked as therapy for him as much as he feels the travel did.   I am guessing that a story written from Kurt's perspective would be more exciting.  I did finish the book, though felt it dragged on, and have to admit I'd see the movie...for more insight on Kurt. 
 I'm an architect and was very much looking forward to this book as I am a fervent believer that bigger is not better.  I am always searching for good examples of how to do things as efficiently as possible, which produces a better design and ultimately costs less.  People do not need 3000 square feet houses.  I got this book for christmas and am very disappointed. First, the editing is terrible.  There are literally pages that are marked "lower floor plan" & "upper floor plan" which are blank.  Secondly, the majority of these houses are architectural follies.  They are not "houses" in the meaning that most of us mean when we say house.  They are playhouses - art lofts, guest houses, vacation houses, etc.  How we live in a structure for a few hours of pleasurable work each day and how we live in our actual house varies greatly.  How many of us recreate our same lives while we are on vacation?  That is the whole problem with this book.  It should rightly be called "Expensive architectural follies under 1500 square feet."  In reviewing this book there is nothing that will inform you how to live in a smaller space.  There is nothing that will redefine the idea of house.  That being said there are some very nice pavillions.  
 ****this review is NOT for the superbit version***** The 2 star rating is not for the movie, but the fact that the description on this site says its widescreen; it kind of sucks when you get the movie in the mail, it says on the movie case its widescreen, yet its full screen, not much you can do.  Can someone at Amazon change the product description to reflect whats going on?  It would help out 
 I found this book to be poorly written and disorganized. It also mentions some products in general terms but never tells what the products are 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 It is quite possible for this film to wash over you and leave absolutely no trace of passing.  There are about three or four lines in this effort which are funny however the tedium in-between does not make them worth the wait.  Part of the problem with this film was that I felt that I had seen it all before. Which, of course, I had in Four Weddings. Slightly pathetic, floppy-haired middle-class Englishman falls for glamorous American who rejects him them gets back together with him and has a group of friends suffering from various disabilities.  Not since "Intersection" have I spent a movie looking at my watch to see when it ended. I honestly don't know who was worse, Julia Roberts or Hugh Grant. They both became so grating on the nerves that I couldn't wait for the movie to end. The most enjoyable part of the film (aside from it being over) were the trailers they showed before it.  Not worth seeing or renting. Save the money for something better... it shouldn't be that hard 
 My husband and I did not bother finishing this book. We skipped around to different chapters, as the editors suggest, in hopes of finding something erotic. The editors clearly had lofty aspirations for this book, but their  intentions fell short of what they managed to achieve. Unfortunately, most  of the stories were poorly written and laughably ridiculous; a bad  combination. You can get mediocre erotica on the 'net for free. Don't waste  your money 
 I had high hopes for this book, but they were soon dashed.  The book is terribly superficial, and is more of a lengthy series of factoids than a deep analysis of current issues.  The writing style is breezy, and has the feel of Newsweek or Time articles rather than what one would expect from a nearly 400 page book.  As to the substance, the Tofflers point to "deep fundamentals" of social activity, consisting of time, space, and knowledge.  These fundamentals are undergoing change, as the pace of life and innovation accelerate, more knowledge is generated, and we shift into the "third wave" of civilization.  They also claim that we are in a new era of "revolutionary wealth," in which monetary, measurable wealth of consumers and producers is joined with the value provided by "prosumers," a neologism that describes those who provide value for themselves, or engage in volunteer activity to help others.  I don't see how the mere recognition of this element of activity is revolutionary, however, inasmuch as it has always existed.  Much of the book engages in digressions that do not really further the thesis of the book.  I also found that they emphasized their criticisms of "antiscientific" activities of environmentalists and animal rights activists, but paid scant attention to those in American society who deny and attack evolution theory, resist efforts to have governmental sponsorship of stem cell research, and who advocate a radical right wing political agenda.  These concerns, which are prominent in Kevin Phillips's far more insightful book American Theocracy, are never explored by the Tofflers.  Ironically, the Tofflers engage in what I would call "second wave" logic and analysis in pursuing what they call "third wave" ideas.  They perfunctorily dismiss any ways of knowing outside the reductionist scientific paradigm.    I would not recommend this book as one that is particularly edifying.  There are some interestng vignettes and factoids in it, however.  Most of the endnotes are citations to newspaper and magazine articles, and website entries.  Occasionally there is a book or journal article citation, but the flavor of this book is more of a journalistic essay than an analytical study with well-considered insights about how the future will unfold 
 When a book is entitled "Thailand in Pictures", you expect... well... pictures. Lots of them. Especially when it's a book for children. This book doesn't even provide anything like the good scenic pictures of cities or landscapes that text-based travel guides provide, and they usually have only a few pages of illustration. A very poor picture of a mudslide during monsoon season... why would anyone really be interested in seeing that? Maybe if it was engulfing an entire home or something, but this photo just looks like a lump of wet dirt. I bought this because it looked like the closest thing I could find to a pictoral book on Thailand, and returned it the next day. Don't waste your money on it 
 At first I was very happy with this stroller. I love the big wheels, the front one which swivels. The cup holders are convenient for both parent and baby. And the adjustable handle is awesome because I'm short and I can push the stroller at a comfortable height. Also it maneuvers very easily up and down curbs, steers easily even with one hand everywhere from the mall, museum, park, or on city streets.   One of the biggest drawbacks for me has been the reclining seat back. There is a drawstring that you must adjust. This requires two hands and can be difficult at times if the child is fussy or uncooperative. Despite this, I still loved the stroller until recently.  However, after only two months of use, my stroller will not lock. It has actually folded up on my son while pushing it. I now cannot even seem to lock it into the open position for use. I have not found any levers to snap in place to hold it open. And because the stroller folds outward, not inwards like an umbrella stroller, it actually pulls the childs body backwards when the locks give out. This is very dangerous. I am contacting the manufacturer about this defect 
 This is clearly not the success they would like it to be. it is very incomplete and patchy. Some artists are covered too succintly and some should not be included in a rock encyclopedia. If you need one reference work, this is clearly not it. This is probably due to the direction that RS magazine has taken over the last decade or so. While it was indispensable reading it has become hopeless and out of touch. I really used to read it but the quality of the writing has gone down the drain and this is reflected here. It is surprising since the early editions of their album guide were quite fantastic. 
 In the last few years rock music biographies have come of age and many are well researched, full of insight and show a real and objective understanding of the artist in question. Victor Bockris' study of one of the most important icons of the 1960's unfortunately falls far short of what I've come to expect.  The book reads like a lazy retread of thirty years of news clippings and has very little insight into what actually made the Stones become the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world. He's good at knitting together a constant series of quotes and old interviews into a below average narrative but seems to be unable to actually have any real understanding of the people behind the words.  With less than a quarter of the book dedicated to the years when the Stones actually had some validity and almost half of it dedicated to the incredibly tedious 'heroin' years Bockris misses the whole point of why a book about Keith Richards should be written. One unproductive junkie is just like any other and I don't need nearly two hundred repetitive pages to get the message. As another reviewer has rightly pointed out, the author seems to have an unnatural admiration of Keith's heroin addiction and completely fails to comment on the fact that it neatly coincides with the band's rapid creative decline.   I can only hope that the next four hundred page book on one of popular music's most influential guitar players will have three hundred of them covering the period of 1964 to 1971 with the remainder dealing with the following thirty six years when the Rolling Sones simply ceased to have any relevance 
 I was thoroughly disappointed in this book, which I found to be a dull recitation of facts.  The author has little interest in the artistic side of Rodgers, which is--I presume--the reason why we would want to know more about him in the first place.  I have a huge shelf of musical theater books, but this one isn't going to end up there 
 but a polemic. my apologies for abusing the democratic voting/reviewing process. my lame excuse it that down below mitchell's own editor gives this book 5 stars, and somebody had to counterbalance that. mitchell hasn't just translated/written on the gita, but the german poet rilke, the gospel according to jesus, and the tao te ching (his one book i read, and disliked) etc. reading the reviews of his books you'll see that accessibility it touted by numerous people, but many (seemingly serious and well read) others claim that his loose interpretations miss the mark. you decide for yourself, but as for me, i'm looking forward to his coming releases "dabbling in the qu'ran", "sticking my toe in the Holy See", and the grand finale "Unencumbered by Humility - The Religion of Mitchell: How you too can be smarter than everybody else", available at the great introductory price of just $498. Enjoy 
 It's too bad most Americans have only read one book on globalization, i.e.,  Firedman's middlebrow, misinfomed tome. Friedman makes "arguments by assertion," assertions based not on documented facts, but on stories from friends and elite CEOs he visits --not even one footnote reference. Yet his book influences business and government leaders around the globe. By what it leaves out, it does nothing more than misinform the American people and our leaders.  Actually, the world isn't flat; it's tilted in favor of unfettered global corporations that exploit cheap labor in China, India and beyond. Instead I suggest you read, "The World is Flat?" by Aronica & Ramdo. This concise monograph brings clarity to many of Friedman's misconceptions, and explores nine key issues that Friedman largely ignores, including the hollowing out of America's debt-ridden middle class. To create a balanced exploration of globalization, the authors cite the work of experts that Friedman fails to incorporate, including Nobel laureate and former Chief Economist at the World Bank, Dr. Joseph Stiglitz.   Refreshingly, you can now gain new insights into globalization without weeding through Friedman's almost 600 pages of ill-informed, grandiloquent prose and bafflegab 
 Legally Blonde 2 - Red, White & Blonde is a very disapponting sequel to the blockbuster hit 2001, Legally Blonde. I love the original so much but the this one is slow, boring, has a stupid premise, and Reese looks like she hated filming this movie. All the magic is gone, people still treat Elle like she is an idiot. Sally Field's character is heartless and cold as well, Luke Wilson makes a brief apparance as Elle's boyfriend and yes they do get married in the end. This sequel focuses on Animal Rights in Washington D.C. Elle worries about the safety of her dog, the adorable Bruiser but I just couldn't get in to the story or new characters. Poor Reese, she is a wonderful actress, but maybe she should have read the script again before she agreed to take this sequel head on. Forget this film, buy the original instead. 
 We enjoyed the first couple of lessons, and I was really excited about these cds. Unfortunately, the sound became almost completely incomprehensible after the first few lessons, sounding almost like a robotic or synthesized voice. I see other reviews that complain about this, too, so purchase this at your own risk. It's hard to imagine that a company would ship so many defective cds, especially cds where sound quality and comprehension are the most important aspects 
 This book was an OK read, not a bad book, but nothing spectacular either. The writing seemed to drone on without any real punch and it never did foster any real excitement for the evolving story of New York as the center of the art world. The book misses a great opportunity to do something significant with an interesting subject. It mostly felt like a narrative of events punctuated by passages of overwrought artspeak. The word "dialectic" was used much too many times.  When I finished the book I'm not sure what I read. The only new insights that I developed from the book came from the discussion about Fairfield Porter.    The book suffers from being published at about the same time as the much more captivating Stevens & Swans' "De Kooning: An American Master" which covers much of the same ground but is a more interesting read. 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I bought the four pack of these pillows and kept finding the pillows thrown in other rooms.  My husband informed me that he hates the pillows.  They are not soft, and are crunchy and loud when you lie on them.         
 "Dark Tort" was inoffensive and certainly not painful to read, but for a novel that's supposed to be part of a quirky, light mystery series, I found things a bit leaden.  The book took forever to get past the opening scene where the body was discovered, and when we finally do move beyond that scene, a huge tangle of clues and suspects quickly built up that slowed things down even further.    I do admit that it also doesn't help that I'm one of those people who can't suspend disbelief and have to ask, "...so she's an off-site caterer yet she continually runs across dead bodies whose murderers need to be identified?"  But, that's just me.  Oh, well... many of the recipes did sound good, though I doubt I'll get around to making any of them.  This is one of those reviews where it's probably best to just say that if you liked the previous entries in this series (which I personally haven't read but suspect aren't much different than this one), you'll likely enjoy this installment, too.  The rest of us can just wait for the latest Robert B. Parker "Spenser" novel for our light mystery fix.    
 This book was first published in 1981, but later edited and republished with a new title in 1984.  The author was clearly influenced to change the direction of this book from the first printing because of his contact with YWAM, John Dawson, Richard Twiss, Daniel Kikawa and others who are hawking these same ideas.  Any good Christian anthropologist will tell you that history shows that, though most Gentile cultures had some sort of "supreme being" they worshipped, those "supreme beings" were one god among a pantheon of gods.  The Bible is clear that "from the creation of the world" all Gentile cultures had corrupted the knowledge of the true God.  Though the first printing of this book had some good ideas about cross-cultural methods to preach the Gospel to many cultures, the additions to this book prove clearly that it is unbiblical in its basic premise.  The new title "Eternity In Their Hearts: Startling Evidence of Belief in the One True God in Hundreds of Cultures Throughout the World" is an unbiblical statement.  Why do I say that?  Two verses end Richardson's unbiblical speculations:  Eph. 2:11-13  Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of  men)-remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now inChrist Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ. Rom. 10:14-15  How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news! 
 My 4 year old loves this set of books!  They were challenging yet easy enough to experience success.  The sentence patterns and picture clues are perfect for young pre-K/K readers. 
 Two things about this book are depressing. First, the author has no patience or self-discipline, and thus cannot possibly learn to play piano well. So why does he go on this "quest" to obtain an expensive piano? The real reason, which goes unsaid but runs as a sad subtext through the book, is that it is easy for the author, who has money, to spend that money on a piano, and the satisfaction of owning the piano serves him as a substitute for the satisfaction that would be gained from learning to play it. The second reason this book is depressing is a quality that this book happens to share with countless "personal journey" memoirs that are coming out these days. It is that the author does not have the discipline, education or interest to write a serious work of non-fiction about pianos, piano manufacture or piano playing, and so turns to the much abused memoir format to squeeze a book out of what are, ultimately, mundane experiences, shallow insights and personal challenges that are ultimately abandoned 
 I was at first rather impressed by the epic size of the book thinking it must contain something new about the comedian. Well, I was wrong. It was long, tedious and nasty. Granted, Chaplin was not perfect, but the author's preoccupation with his imperfections borders on sickening. A better title for this book would be 'Trash, what I think of Charlie'. Joyce Milton would do well writing for tabloids.. 
 Let any man who understands know that this name "Maitreya" is the sum of 666. This being is none other that the Light Bearer-The Bright Morning Star-THE FALLEN ONE...LUCIFER. Woe unto the inhabitants of the earth, for the beast has come down to you as a Lion, seeking whomever he may devour--Revelations. There is only ONE Christ. He was the ONLY son of God Yehovah. For God so loved the world, that he gave his ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, so that who so ever shall believe in him shall not parish but have everlasting life--John 3:16 "Beware, for many will come saying here is the Christ, or I am the Christ...they will come as wolves in sheep's clothing"--Lucifer will claim to be the Christ!. Do not be deceived...For The one and only Christ-JESUS-said in Matthew "There shall rise false Christs, who shall show great signs and wonders...he shall deceive even the elect." Maitreya who promises us something that he cannot give, has only one agenda...to destroy the human race. Christ will indeed return to earth after 7 years of Maitreya's rule. This time will be known as the Tribulation. This Tribulation's beginning will be marked by Maitreya's 7 year agreement w/ Isreal. This agreement, like all promises made by the Father of Lies, will be broken. There is no "Godhood" for any of us. This same thing was promised to Eve in the Garden... "for you will know the difference between good and evil and be as Gods" The real reward for this trespass against God (as Lucifer knew it would be according to eternal law) was seperation from God and the beginning of suffering. "And take heed to yourselves, lest anytime your heart be overcharged [with the cares of this life ] so that the day will come upon you unawares" Luke 21-34   The time is soon now, very soon. God Speed in these last days. 
 They clean the screen, so to speak, but also leave a slight film behind which can be seen when the monitor is off. It doesn't really affect viewing while the monitor is actually on, but I still don't like the fact that the screen is not completely clean after treatment. The monitor would have been cleaner overall had I just wiped it with a dry lint free cloth.   Perhaps some people would view this film as a relatively minor flaw, since it doesn't affect picture during use, but regardless, I am extremely disappointed to pay money for a product specifically marketed as a screen cleaner with results anything other than excellent. I thought these would be a solution but they've turned out to be just another problem I have to figure out. 
 You don't want to read a book about writing that is badly written.  As far as I can tell, Usborne figured that since the book is offline, it should not follow the high-impact rules of writing that he would use online.  Well, online and offline writing is not THAT different!  This book is turgid and useless.  Other books on the market are superior 
 I love David Cross's comedy,  I love his stand up, I love Mr. Show. But this dvd is not kinda boring, it is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  There may be a few folks who find something entertaining in this dvd -- there is no accounting for taste. But 98 out of 100 normal people will simply shake their heads trying to figure out why this dvd was released 
 this book did not define any good portrayal of anything. it is severley overpriced for a paperback and ran me about $30.00!!!! THAT IS REDICULOUS.  I WANT A REFUND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS A F 
 This book is unorganized, out-of-date, too focused on New York City, and on every other page promotes the authors and their careers...On page 7 they are telling you how much has changed with the computer age, and the internet, and one of the authors tells you he went to grade school and they used quill pens and fountain jars...okay, I didn't need to know that.  It was so annoying that by page 14, I was going to submit to them a list of improvements, but it would have been EXTENSIVE!  From there on just gritted my teeth and got through it...Good luck!  You'll be really tired of the references to the Trade City Bombing, and NYC in general, by the end of it 
 I excitedly upgraded to Office 2007....'07 Outlook is FAR slower - ties my reasonably powerful machine up in knots (110% of resources) for minutes at a time inexplicably; spell ck doesn't work consistently; HTML emails have lost functionality I used to use often with 2003 ver; Excel opens MUCH more slowly; no real gains in Excel fuctionality; various add-ins essential to my biz no longer work in Excel 2007; Access 2007 was billed as much easier to use - FALSE; Word has a couple of improvements but messes up spell ck with Outlook if you keep both Word 2003 & 2007 on yr machine; the highly touted "Ribbon" is mainly cosmetic; I believe 2007's indexing is at the heart of some of sluggisness which might be ok if it worked..but it retruns strange results....NET, NET, I am uninstalling Office 2007 and going back to 2003 with all its stupid faults....it's too bad no one at MSFT actually uses thier products to realize how defective they are.  
 But this for my kids and it was the most boring movie I have ever watched. The shows are more entertaining to watch then the movie 
 Boring on disc...not a true musical theatre score at all!  Not Disney's best effort, but it will be a cash cow. Visually interesting on stage, but not enough to make for the extra-slim story line.  Kids will love it 
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 since there is little to no mystery involved in the story.  I should have expected this, since this has been the trend for the last 4 or 5 books in the series.  I had put off reading this one for precisely that reason but needed something to read for the weekend so I decided to give it a try.  The best thing that can be said about this "Turkey" is that it's a quick read, so it's good for a plane ride, but if you want something that remotely resembles a mystery pass this one up and read one of the first books by this author which really were engaging and satisfying mysteries.    Even as a glimpse into the small town life of Moose County this one falls flat.  It used to be that one of the charms of the series was the way Braun had developed the world of Moose County and all the foibles of its inhabitants and if tragedy struck one you really felt for them.  In this book, characters from previous books are randomly introduced and they wander around aimlessly and there is no emotional depth to Qwill's relationship with any of them.     The other problem that has happened to the series is that Braun fell in love with her own character.  Qwill started the series as a flawed charcter.  In "Turkey" there is even more rapturous description of Qwill's mustache and wonderful voice than usual, not to mention the ovations for the ridiculous Big Storm production.  We are supposed to believe that it is so well received that there are to be several performances a week throughout the summer - how big is the population of Moose county?    SPOILER ALERT:  But to cap off the ridiculousness of this book, Qwill leaves his beloved Koko out in the gazebo with a confessed murderer who is strung out on drugs.  The Qwill of past books would never have intentionally put either cat in danger like this.    According to her fan club web page, she was born in 1916 so now she's pushing 90.  It's possible she's in poor health. Because of this I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and agree with those who suggest this book was ghost-written based on notes she made.  That would account for inconsistencies in plot and style.  The only good part of this book - the only reason it deserves even one star - is the description of YumYum playing with her thimble (but even it is taken from another of Braun's books).  It's on page 72 - read it, then find something else to read.          
 Ambush Bay is not art.  It is not entertainment.  It is not even interesting. Ambush Bay is without a doubt one of the worst WWII movies ever produced.  The best part of this movie is Robert Mitchum's red cap, worn while he is in the Philippine jungle hiding from Japanese soldiers.  Red cap....  Why not wear universal orange?  I've seen the movie twice.  Once with the sound on.  It was awful.  I watched it again, with the sound off.  It was better this second time.  It had the feel, without sound, of an ok comedy.  With the sound it was pathetic.  Don't both buying it.  Spend your money on something more useful or entertaining.  
 This book should have either covered a narrower base, or covered it's broad base more carefully. Halfway through I realized that about the only point I really was getting was "the East hates the West, in particular the Muslims hate the Jews."  There were lots more specifics, but I didn't feel as if there was enough context for them to help. Instead the specific examples clouded the meaning for me and distracted me from the real theme.  I had to finish it because I read if for a class, but unless you have to read it...don't. You can find much better writing 
 This CD is the book being read by a text to speach piece of software. It is totally unacceptable & far too difficult to listen to 
 This book provides a broad overview of some of the issues behind the Simplicity movement.  The author, Cecile Andrews set up a number of Simplicity study circles near her home in the Northwest.  This book reveals some of the factors that led her to become interested in Simplicity as well as her ideas of how Simplicity study circles might work.  Much of the beginning of the book provides justification for adopting Simplicity.  Andrews enumerates problems such as hyper-consumption, environmental degradation, and personal isolation.  She also explores possible actions we could take to solve these problems, such as consciously building community with other people and the earth, finding ways to express our spirituality, and restructuring our economic system to make it more environmentally and socially friendly. In the last part of the book, she describes the idea of Simplicity study circles, the benefits that might be gained from participating in one, and how a study circle should operate.  She also provides a 10-week study plan based on the earlier material in the book.  Although I agree with the ideas in this book, I found the book rather disappointing in content.  Much of the discussion is either so personal as to be hard to generalize, or else a superficial summary of other more substantial texts.  For example, Andrews frequently refers to findings of Juliet Schor; readers would have more material for discussion by reading Schor's works directly.  Some of Andrews' suggestions for addressing problems are rather inappropriate.  To draw attention to hyper-consumerism, she suggests surreptitiously clothes-pinning tags with messages like "You don't really need this, do you?" inside articles of clothing in shops.  While I'm all for trying to get people to become more aware of their needless purchases, I don't think messing with the property of individual store owners is an acceptable way to go about the mission.  Her suggestions for reforming our economic system would be great in an ideal state, but until we are run by a benevolent socialist dictator, I don't think they can realistically be put into action.  It would be better to focus our efforts on goals that are conceivably achievable.  Overall, while I found the topic of this book interesting, I think there are numerous other books on the topic of Simplicity that are better implemented, starting with Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin's "Your Money or Your Life".  It's hard to tell from this book if Andrews can take credit for originating Simplicity study groups such as those run by the Northwest Earth Institute.  If so, she certainly deserves credit for her efforts in that area, but I don't think there's enough substantial material in this volume to use as background reading for an effective study group by itself. 
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 If you like to grab a book and take a nap shortly after opening it, this is the book for you. It starts out keeping your interest, but will quickly loose it. If you are looking for a book that really lets you meet York  (which was what I was looking  for), this is not the right book. This book  is a wealth of information, but you will get easily dis-interested, lost,  and confused as the author goes into great depths to introduce the men that  were involved in York's struggles after the war. I was hoping for a book  about York and his family, but was disappointed in this one.  He gives very  little information about York's family life 
 I have no idea where Warner dredged up these desperate, anxiety ridden mommies fretting over Baby Einstein and private schools. As a stay home mom, by choice, I resent the implication that all women who choose to stay home are mired in a unfulfilled tedious life. And as far as these crazy women running themselves ragged - Ladies, you made a CHOICE to book your kids into a gazillion activities. My children are at their most creative with a few blankets, the kitchen table and some cardboards boxes. Remember making kitchen table forts on rainy days? And I am pretty well convinced neither of my kids are going to end up mentally impaired, at the bottom of their class or having their college admission applications rejected because I wasn't tutoring them in conversational Japanese rather than coloring in a color book together each afternoon. And if the childcare system/motherhood support system is so great in France, then move back to France! Encouraging the US government to provide some pie in the sky support is naive and short sighted. Instead, look to cultivating your community and embracing your neighbors as friends and helpmates rather than competition. Making true connection with others in community is a rare and splendid thing. Here on planet Earth, despite the anxious paranoid feeling we are all supposed to be feeling, the Joneses don't give a hang if we drive a Mercedes and they  really aren't out to get us 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Don't buy this book, unless you have a copy machines that enlarges in your home. Very disappointed. Will never buy a book from That Patchwork Place again 
 If you are looking at buying this book because someday you would like to build you own Audio Amplifier, forget it! There is really no information in this book that is useful in terms of that. Its very NON-TECHNICAL and personally I feel why would anybody write such a book ? What information is attempted at being given to the reader ? Utterly Useless! This one didnt even survive two hours. 
 I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of 
 This is one of the worst films for kids I have ever seen with my four year old son.  It is built around fear, bullies, aggression, and ugly stereotypes.  This film is a bonanza for therapists and sociologists, and it goes a long way towards explaining some of the pathologies of this society.  How about a movie that lets kids be kids, instead of this onslaught of cheap sentiments and terror?  The calculated story uses every trick to scare kids.  The limited imagination of the story writers is particularly insulting. Is everything just about good and evil and the fight for survival?  For young kids??  In many ways the film is a throwback to Cold War films such as Red Dawn (1984), in which school kids fought a Soviet invasion (no kidding!).  Is "A Bug's Life" how we are supposed to prepare our kids for the war on terrorism?  In sum, this film is a toxic brew.  Kids deserve better.   
 In order to tell the tale, a movie in the range of three hours would have been required. Instead, you are given about half of that (102 minutes). Instead of a solid bridge from start to finish, you are given stepping stones, some of which are covered in moss. To make matters worse, the actors seem over-rehearsed and uninspired. In some cases, the actors may have been miscast. The bottom line is this: READ THE BOOK. If you want to experience this story, there is no shortcut, you must read the book. I am confident you will find the written story a fine one indeed; worthy of reading 
 Calleman was a well regarded biological researcher.  A quick query will turn up many serious, scientific papers on chemical toxicology, carcinogens and a variety of other very complex research topics.  Alas, this book is not one of them.  In writing this text Calleman puports to connect the Mayan calendar with some unifying theory of human consciousness.  He tends to ignore several basic tenets of any good treatise.  First of all, there are no substantial references in this work.  Nothing is footnoted and a number of the assertions and claims are attributed to "an unpublished work" of his own.    This is only compounded by the wandering writing style of this book.  It almost seems as if it is a compilation of essays and notes rather than a cohesive postulation.  Calleman makes no sound argument for the reader to understand the Mayan calendar.  He ignores several significant Mayan sites, such as Copan, and a wide body of archaelogical work which would invailidate his theory.  As one critic pointed out, he takes a decidedly Swedish and Christian view of his theory. This occuldes any potential scholarly understanding of his statements and converts what I had hoped to be an interesting intellectual journey into more New Age pop philosophy.  Avoid this and seek out some truly legitimate work on the Mayan culture.  They are a fascinating people without all the ridiculous attributes being foisted upon them 
 . . . and this work is no different than any of theirs 
 I found History of the Balkans very flat as I have a interest in former Yugoslavia.Mr Glenny pasted over English created problems ie:Blieburg, he would have you believe happened as a Partisan only action against Women ,Children & Ustashe members.He should cover one Country rather than try cram the whole region into one book 
 Well, that should've been the name of the book.  If you're looking for advice on working within the building code bureaucracy, this book might be for you.  If you're looking for advice on building according to code, you  need to look elsewhere.  It does give insight into the mind of the  inspector, admitting permits are for taxing and taking glee on setting the  attorney general on a citizen who was trying to prevent the inspector from  trespassing on his land. I bought the book hoping to get a concise guide to  the code, but was mistaken 
 I had such high hopes for this book, based on its description.  And in spite of the author's sometimes hard-to-follow writing style - she does love to start in one place and wander quite far from the original subject before finally winding her way back - for the first few chapters I managed to hold on to those hopes.    But in the end, I would have to classify this book as 80 percent disappointment.  Charlotte is set up to be a very sympathetic character: Married to a man she loves, but trapped in the family home surrounded by a seemingly endless supply of in-laws (also all residents of the family home), none of whom have ever made much of an effort to make her feel a part of the family.  Charlotte has been unable to bear a child to term in all the years of the marriage, and her 10 months in a sickbed seem to have put the final distance between her and her husband, Hays.  Finally, after an inexplicable recovery (the author never bothers to give any hint of why Charlotte is suddenly well after all this time), Charlotte is off to surprise her husband at the wake for one of his recently deceased uncles.  But what she encounters is Hays and a mystery woman, just about to share a kiss.   Calling in a favor from the local baker and his wife, Charlotte finds herself at the hotel of the title, facing a chilly reception from Mrs. Petty - the former cook in Charlotte's in-law's house - who had been the one to first tell Charlotte about the hotel. (Though not about the details of what goes on there.)  To this point, the book was enjoyable.  But once Charlotte lands in the hotel, the book heads into a decline from which it never recovers.    The efforts of the hotel's owner, his staff and Charlotte's Aunt Lily - a surprise "regular" at the hotel - to get Charlotte out of the hotel were understandable, if a little tedious.  Arthur's attachment to Charlotte is pretty sudden, and regardless of how she feels about Hays' cheating on her, it seems a little odd that she would embark on an affair with Arthur quite so easily.  And unless the author is planning a sequel, there were things in this book that just didn't seem to have a reason for being.  Charlotte's introduction to the hotel owner's wife and her servant, for example.  An interesting enough scene, but to what purpose?    The artist who created all the paintings in the hotel - introduced, then killed off.   Mrs. Petty and her children - suddenly packed off to another situation, for the good of the children.  Sure, we learn who the father of one of the children is, but again - why?  Charlotte's parents, who have been conspicuously absent from Charlotte's thoughts for a good portion of the book - there's no purpose to their appearance at the end, nor really to Charlotte's search for them.  The ending, as mentioned by another reviewer, is the worst part of the book.  Why does Charlotte do what she does when she leaves the hotel?  Is it guilt, a desire for reconciliation?    Charlotte frustrates me...I don't know what she wants, and most of the time she doesn't seem to know, either.  In the end, I didn't care much about this book, except to wonder about the several chapters that seemed to have been lopped off the end.  Maybe they would have wrapped things up in a better fashion.  I won't read this book again, and I certainly can't recommend it to others.  
 Milo Ventimiglia (Gilmore Girls, The Bedford Diaries) stars as Zack Harper, a kid who helps out his friend Kyle who is in a bit of a rut. Kyle was challenged by a senior to do the Dirty Deeds. The Dirty Deeds (there's 10 of them) are just random things on a piece of paper the person has to accomplish. There's also a record that has never been beating before. So, Milo sets out to do the Dirty Deeds and there's also a party being thrown at a house where they keep a scoreboard of how many Milo has done. Not Another Teen Movie!! Just had to say that but its bascially what it is. In American Pie you had Jason Biggs doing the pie and in this, well Milo Ventimigla enters a bag of whole wheat bread (if you know what I mean). Milo helps the film but nothing is special about this movie. More moronic characters. My advice is watch it (Unrated or not) once and the decisions are up to you. Also starring Lacey Chabert (Not Another Teen Movie, Mean Girls) of course, Mark Derwin (One Life To Live, Heist), Zoe Saldana (Drumline, Pirates of the Caribbean), Panso Gorson (South of Nowhere, Dear Wendy), Billy L. Sullivan (My Life, Little Big League), Ray Santiago (Meet The Fockers, Pinero), Todd Zeile (King of Queens, SNL), Michael Milhoan (American Gun, Pearl Harbor), Erin Torpey (Crescendo, One Life To Live), Arielle Kebbel (Aquamarine, Be Cool), Dave Power (Frailty, Boston Public) and Charles Durning (The Final Countdown, Rescue Me) for some odd reason that I dont know why. What does the Unrated version have to offer? Female Nudity what else?! 
 I was rather disappointed in Mr. Peterson's work. He dwells much too long on trying to convince us of "the problem". Nearly the first half of the book is spent on statistic overload!  Even after wading through the  numbers and graphs, I am still skeptical of his conclusions and would  caution readers to do further research.  Certainly the Baby Boomers are an  aging bulge in the population of the US and will create some challenges.   However, the author fails to mention the "echo boom" (baby  boomer's children which are equal in number) and he glosses over the impact  of the huge young immigration population that comes into the country every  year.  Both of these facts will "soften" the impact of the  "Gray Doom" that Mr. Peterson tries to create.  I just don't  anticipate the tremendous problem of which  he tries to make us aware.  But  I did find interesting the apparently huge impact that abortions and birth  control will have on our future. Another disappointment was very little  discussion of aging trends and buying habits. Despite these shortcomings, I  enjoyed parts of the book and it stimulated thinking about the future and  the impact of aging populations 
 This tape really doesn't show you how to do all of the cuts listed.  In fact, you don't ever see a complete groom from start to finish and all of the dogs are show dogs who stand perfectly still without the use of a grooming tether.  The tape also assumes a certain amount of knowledge about grooming and grooming tools; she tells you the name of the tools but not why she choose them or which breeds to use them on.  I was expecting a step by step video including expert tips on grooming but it was more a "show" with occasional comments tossed out.  The groomer almost seemed bored with her job!  I purchased it so that our novice volunteers could learn about grooming but I don't see how it will help educate them.  We'll probably never use it 
 As a stand-alone story (not a "prequel"), this book is relatively fun - if you can ignore the countless glaring grammatical errors and typos. I can't believe this made it past editing!   As far as being a prequel to Barrie's Peter Pan, this book misses the mark. There are too many blatant inconsistencies for this to be anything but a shallower "re-telling" of Barrie's richly woven classic. These are not the characters we knew and loved; this is not the Never Land we dreamed about at night. Pixie dust is now nothing more than "space dust" which causes strange and unpredictable genetic mutations on contact. Need I say more 
 First, I should say that I haven't yet heard any of the Oasis records made after this one. Like most people I got into Oasis (as well as Blur) during the Definitely Maybe/Morning Glory years. When I heard "Be Here Now" I couldn't help wondering if the band had lost its edge. I liked The Master Plan a lot, but as it was more a loose collection of B-sides than an album in its own right, I didn't read it as indicative of a specific musical direction.   By the time I bought a cassette of SOTSOG during an April 2000 trip to the UK, my Britpop tastes had moved on to Stereophonics, Belle & Sebastian and Badly Drawn Boy. I listened to that cassette in my rental car all during the trip. I wasn't crazy about it. I really liked a couple songs, but when I got back to the US I put the tape away and rarely ever listened to it until a few weeks ago.  So, my take on SOTSOG:  Noel Gallagher has always written trite lyrics, but the triteness was forgivable because his songs had great hooks and were loud and noisy and made you want to jump around. SOTSOG shows that when Noel goes mellow, his lyrics quickly go from innocuous to annoying - and these songs generally aren't hooky enough to compensate.   Letting Liam join the songwriting guild was not a smart remedial step; at this stage, Liam's simply a juvenile songwriter. I don't oppose the mellowing of Oasis, but if they are going to turn the noise down they're going to have to ratchet up the hook quotient or come up with some more sophisticated lyrics. Noel's mellow tunes on The Master Plan ("Going Nowhere", "The Masterplan") came closer to achieving this balance.  That said, the album has a few highlights. The Celtic raga-hymn "Who Feels Love" is one of the band's best songs, ever; since the CD-single of this song is more expensive than SOTSOG, the album is worth buying for this one song alone. Also, "Go Let It Out" is pretty much vintage Oasis, bright and crisp.  I like where Noel Gallagher is going. I'm interested to see if Oasis' post-SOTSOG output is better 
 I love Heinlein.  I think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction.  I find that his plots and ideas are inventive.  Even this story was inventive in many ways, like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters.  However, I found this book as a whole to be very boring.  Much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters.  The "main" characters of each section of the book aren't fully realized at all.  I wouldn't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really, really bored 
 mosier is the worst type of historical writer, really a historical fiction writer.  he just makes up stuff as he sees fit, like 'hitler was the genius behind all the germans' successes' and claims inane things like 'the ablest german generals and field marshals were simply great captains but not great generals'.  mosier is the quintessential fat grognard who's played too many games of axis and allies and believes that makes for a well-rounded education of the second world war.   1. hitler ordered the 6th army to stand firm when they could have broken out to the west, losing around 300,000 men or so. 2. hitler refused von manstein's attempts to follow through in operation zitadelle, which in effect threw away all the hard fought gains in the southern part of the bulge. 3. while generals like rommel and guderian may indeed have been greater 'captains' as opposed to great strategic commanders, von manstein was easily the best strategic commander of modern warfare.   despite this, cross of iron is really a tame book.  those two statements are really all mosier contributes in the book, the only 'shocking' revelations.  for pure shock/stupid value, his novel 'the myth of blitzkrieg' was a far more entertaining and fanciful read.   
 0 stars if there were such a thing ugly boring squares (oops, i mean "patterns") cheesy hickish dialect Great! for middle america an example of bloggers jumping on the knitting book bandwagon feeding the sheep along the way really can't for the life of me figure out the hype behind this book 
 it is juust a copy of the frist book. if you read the frist the world is flat, then don't waste your time. jo 
 Oh, I get it alright.  The joke is, I thought the dvd would be funny, and it wasn't, and they got my thirty bucks!  Ho ho ho!  The premise is this: Two guys you've never heard of and Michael Ian Black (the guy who says snarky things about pop culture on VH1) have seen and have enjoyed The Kids in the Hall.  So they steal a few of the characters from the show, and convince Comedy Central to give them 13 episodes.  And then MAGIC is supposed to happen.  The two guys you've never heard of are quite good at playing slow troglodytes, but Michael Ian Black, well, he just can't quite commit to the character he's stolen from Kids in the Hall, and in true Adam Sandler/Ben Affleck tradition, mugs and smirks his way through painfully unfunny dialogue.  The show tries to be many things.  It wants to be Kids in the Hall, obviously, and it also wants to be Arrested Development.  It'd like to be reminiscent of The Office, but it'll settle for Reno 911.  It is none of these shows.  If I was being kind, I'd call it performance art concocted to test the boundaries of a viewer's patience.  "How long can this go on without being funny," one asks oneself.  "Surely it will be funny next episode!"  Nothin' doin'.  If the popular kids in your high school got together and put on a "funny skit" for a talent show, it might be something like this.  Without Michael Ian Black's involvement, it can only be better than STELLA.  And in answer to the question posed a moment ago, this show can go on 10 episodes without being funny.  And then Comedy Central mercifully pulled the plug 
 Rev. Dyson  dissects the great black man of the last century and attempts to get some insight into how his image translates to modern America. I found the chapter concerning Dr. King's embrace of democratic socialism to be enlightening, but I found the Rev. Dyson handing out alibis for King's adultery disappointing. Equally mind blowing is Dyson's using overblown language to assail the King family's efforts to control their loved one's image. I wonder why there are hard feelings, since Dexter and Coretta King talked to him for this book. This is an interesting character study that does draw some modern parallels, but would have been better if it were about 3 chapters shorter 
 I really did want to like this book. It held the promise of demystifying alchemy and applying it to my psychological growth. Unfortunately, I found it sorely lacking in practical applications, exercises, etc. It was also very disorganized, printed on extremely cheap paper and throws in cross-cultural references to Zen Buddhism. Excuse me, but I wanted a book on Western esotericism, not Eastern. .. 
 If I lived in Vermont, and NY, and wrote everyday, and if I cared more about the sweat wicking abilities of my clothes, this would have been a good book.  I live in So Cal, and have vowed to not shop for months at a time successfully.  I thought this book might buttress my ability to do so.  But, I have a viceral annoyance with someone that is okay with asking their neighbors to help them out with their choice of not being responsible for their lack of responsibility.    If I drive on bald tires, I need to have an AAA membership.  If I have a "home" without the basic necessities, I need to make sure I can get through normal climatic changes (um, like, snowstorms in Vermont and NY)without ragging on my "friends" for not being there for me.  I did read the entire book, but only to see if in the end the author told me she should have planned on being more self-sufficient.  She did not 
 Save your money and skip this book.  As stated in other reviews, the title of the book is misleading.  The author mentions here and there how she got out of debt but there was nothing for the reader to grasp onto and use as a course of action.  The tid-bits of information she gives for saving money are obvious and boring if the reader has already been reading books on the "get out of debt" subject.   
 i purchased this item with the recommendation of a make-up sales representative at nordstrom's.  i was less than pleased with the product.  I used the entire container and saw no benefit!! 
 Disappointed. As an English teacher, I expected a more compelling and less hokey use of Whitman.  The first story, of the deformed Whitman loving boy, was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging 
 I bought the book in the airport and started reading it during the 8 hours flight. I could not believe that such an uninteresting and painfully slow paced novel was a bestseller...I forced myself through the first 30 pages...but that was it. I just left it in the airplane.Maybe later got more interesting,I woudn't know that. But what I read was just plain awafull. Now that I look at the amazon's reviews...they are not so bad......makes me very cautious about reviews in the futur 
 This book is an utterly corrupt, crackpot method of lying to others in order to manipulate them, to live under a constant cloud of suspicion, and to essentially ruin your personal relationships.  Shall I give you an example?  From page 122:  "You and a friend are deciding on what movie to see.  You suggest 'Lost In Paradise', but your friend, who doesn't want to see this, offers as evidence a coworker who has already seen it and didn't like it.  you then say 'Oh, well, if no one in your office liked it, I guess it's probably no good.'  If she lets it go at that - not correcting you - then you know she LIED INITIALLY" (emphasis mine).  Excuse me?  What kind of special social retard do you have to be to 'know' your friend is a LIAR because she doesn't want to see a movie?  A little earlier, a technique called "Insert a False Fact" shows up.  INSERT A FALSE FACT?  Isn't that known as LYING?  And this in the context of a party, no less... hoo boy... start lying to everyone at a party because you suspect people of being liars - you're gonna wind up friendless pretty quick.  If you just tell the truth, you'll be amazed at the nice people you meet - who needs a book which rationalizes lying and manipulation?  Trust me, if you have a moral compass, you don't need this rag 
 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
 Superficially Evening's book appears to be all that anybody would ever need about Photoshop CS2.  In fact, it is an impossible introduction for people making the jump from a simpler program, say Elements 3.0.    The organizational structure is poor.    Many ideas are used before they are explained, a fatal flaw as a text, tho' excusable in a pure reference volume.  But "For Photographers" claims to be a text and not a reference.  Terms are slipped in for somewhere without adequate definitions.  And neither the table of contents nor the index are detailed enough to help somebody find most detailed topics.  I bought Scott Kelby's book after putting Evening's on the shelf, probably for good.  Kelby gives the info a photographer making the jump to CS2 requires, although his language is famously just a bit to glib 
 This movie is GOOD, if you do not think of the traditional Arthurian story.  But, unfortunately, to those of us who like the original Arthurian story, this is really a bad movie.  Also, Richard Gere's character fits his real life attitude and so he really didn't have to act in this movie....  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the movie, as a movie, BUT, it has little to do with the King Arthur legend...  much like the more recent movie about King Arthur.  Because of this, it is a major let down to real Arthurian lovers......  So, I am torn between giving it 4 stars for being a fun and exciting movie and giving it a negative 4 stars for letting us true Arthurian buffs down..... so, I will give it a 2 star rating... 
 If you are really interested in what happened between Turks and Armenians in 1915,i can suggest you to read Heath Lowry's The Story Behind Ambassador Morgenthau's Story.Professor Heath Lowry is a well-known historian in Princeton University and in his book,he proves Ambassador Morgenthau's Story wrong scientifically,shows how the book is based on rumors.A must to read for those who are interested in this matter.. 
 I agree with most of the reviews here. I also grew up with watching the re-runs on Sunday mornings as a kid, and so when we introduced a VHS rented tape to my daughters they loved them. The "talkies" are the only films I'd consider buying and I think most people would only want as well. There was 1 DVD missing (we had two #5 DVD's)and missing the Spanky gang #4 disk. Right now we only have 1 original "talkie" and the rest documentaries and silent movies. I believe the company who produces this DVD set should be ashamed of themselves. They plaster Spanky's images all over all the videos and then we don't even have one of him!!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO (unless you like silent movies and bad documentaries) with film qualities that were bad copies (that are hard on the eyes!!!!  We're taking this one back and damanding a refund!! 
 This has got to be the worse introduction to Latin Dancing I have ever seen. It looked like it was shot with a home video & spliced together poorly. The deadpan personalities made it almost comical. I bought this after reading a few positive reviews especially the one from the woman who was married to a "Spanish man" & now she could keep up with him! Save your money for popcorn & watch "Dancing with the Stars" on television, you'll learn more from the amateurs 
 When we first got it, we loved the suction and filtering.  Our son has asthma and this is a good choice for keeping high air quality.    After the first year, the hose got cracks, then a few more months in, the belt and clutch went.  These are expensive repairs, so you really pay for this vacuum.    I thought you pay a high price upfront, you'll be covered with high quality lasting hardware, but nope.  You may as well just get a lower priced, higher performing machine 
 I have to wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers...to be fair the multiplication information that *is* contained in this book are useful and some of the pictures using the chocolate bar can help students. However, the art references by far overshadow the math lesson and as I was reading it, I found myself distracted and confused...and I'm an adult!  The hershey's fractions book is much better than this one. I thought I'd get the set and now I'm glad I didn't--this one is worth skipping over 
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 I'm not into R&B so i'll skip the tracks i'm not interested in. Bought it only for Junior Vasquez Dub which is i must say really bad. Totally boring. I think Junior should release his latest work (Simone Denny - Cliche, Deepa Soul - As I Am)  on CD's instead of letting us buy only his worse mixes. Very unsatisfied 
 kitchenAid 5 ply was not what I expected.  Plus its all made in china.....GET THE ALL CLAD and spend the extra 100 on the 9 piece set 
 This book is fine if you are interested in a purely academic approach. This offers nothing for practitioners 
 Stokes' favourite son belts out another hit album. Sadly there is nothing original here, just another mish-mash of pop tunes that could have been done by any X Factor wannabee.  In fact it may be fair to say that Mr Williams has done very little since 'Let Me Entertain You' and perhaps now might be the time to call it a day, especially as he's struggling to get anyone in the U.S. to notice him! He obviously has talent but why he insists on releasing formulaic albums such as this one is beyond me.  I've given this two stars simply for the fact the cd makes a useful coaster for my coffee mug 
 Investment Banker with a conscience, Ben Hartman, and special agent Anna Navaro's plot lines and bodies soon become intertwined in their quest for the secrets of Sigma, an elite cabal with roots in Nazi Germany that is bent on world domination. What starts out as reasonable and entrancing enough genre pulp becomes sheer Bond by the end, but there's no denying Ludlum has a gift for keeping the heat turned up from page to page.  If you are new to espionage fiction and have even slightly literary sensibilities, run don't walk to writers like Alan Furst, Graham Greene, or even John Le Carré. But if strong characters aren't a necessity, you are able to suspend your disbelief, and you are lusting for pure literary sugar, you probably won't be disappointed.  Ludlum is a great author for those who typically spend hours in front of the television and tremble in anticipation at the release of the next Hollywood blockbuster, because he provides essentially the same experience in written form.  He is a master of the wildly oscillating plot line, but barely approaches apprentice status in any other literary area.  I found myself cringing in embarrassment for the author at many points, but to his credit I was compelled to continue turning the pages until I had reached the end.  It's like candy, you can't stop eating it but feel ill once it's gone.  If you are a die hard Ludlumite I admit this is my first foray.  Please point me to a better example of his work if one exists, otherwise I'll invest my time elsewhere and catch up on Mr. Ludlum by proxy when the next "Bourne" film comes out 
 And why does he write a lamebrain neanderthal book every 6 weeks? And does anyone REALLY read him?   Factcheck much?  Utter tripe 
 For almost 600 pagers the author examines a double crime in 1970 from every single angle and viewpoint. It becomes excruciatingly dull, especially when we are force-fed the red-tape police files (yet additional versions of the versions we have already read). A hackneyed opening plot line about dissatisfaction with ones own race and identity is disposed of early, but not replaced by anything of interest or usefulness to the story. Forget this one; Walters has other very fine mysteries for you 
 One word, terrible. I asked for Nosferatu's Rise (awesome) for christmas and my mom saw this album under the "users who bought this album also bought" category. Save yourself the agravation and pass this one. I feel like Ive been robbed because I put the time into listening to it. There are only two good songs on the album and one of them is all but ruined due to shabby recording quality. The rest either are ruined due to the recording quality, or have terrible lyrics and crappy music, or usualy both. Hunter's kiss is sung in the first person from the perspective of a deer that has just been shot. Stupid stupid stupid. If you want an album like this except better in every way buy the soundtrack to the Witchblade comics. You won't miss out on anything if you dont read them as I dont and still thought it was awesome. Common, Peter Steele is on it 
 I ordered this book, and thought I would not have to read the text, but I was unprepared for the class.  I also did not need the busy-work portions of the book 
 This book is absolutely not worth reading--it's barely readable, has no defined plot, and is an overall disappointment. There is no plot in this book beyond sex scenes and clumsily drawn out character "relationships" which tend to consist of the protagonist realizing that she has to have sex with someone.  I don't recommend this book at all 
 Thats what I got to say about this piece o' sheeitt. When I bought this together with the first one for that kick a** price I thought I was going to watch the sequel of all sequels. I thought big huge offensive against the bugs. How can you go wrong? Well they somehow succeded. Poor acting, garbage special effects, retarded plot, man I can go on and on whats wrong with this pile of trash. But the other reviewers already did this. So I'll just be beatin on a dead horse. Please, if you loved the first ST DO NOT WATCH THIS!. It will put a bad taste in your mouth 
 I'm sorry, but I really don't! It's a style called Celtic Drama, which means it's a combination of stories w/o words and traditional Irish Dancing.  I've never been a Michael Flatley person.  Parts of this are traditional Irish dancing, but other's aren't anywhere near it! There are also long songs, sort of like a choir piece. I don't like those at all.  If you want to see traditional Irish dancing, this is not your movie 
 This book is nothing more than a political diatribe masking itself as history.  Reagan's Ph.D. committee should be ashamed they allowed her to pass this off as a dissertation.  And historians-especially women's historians-should be ashamed to call Reagan one of their own.  I am.  This work is a key example why people don't take women's history seriously 
 I bought this toy for my three year old son so we could have coffee parties. Unfortunately, the water leaks right out of the bottom, so barely any coffee makes it into the pot. Perhaps this item isn't supposed to be used with real water? It does not include any helpful directions or tips. Maybe we will send back and try again, but I think he will be heartbroken otherwise to be without his coffee pot 
 This book starts out slow and dry.  It didn't get exciting until Pat Garrett started to take over the story.  This doesn't occur until about midway through the book.  Don't expect this to be a screenplay for the movies Young Guns and Young Guns II.  The book isn't that exciting but it does introduce you to an interesting character profile of Billy the Kid.  Personally I feel that the first half of the book is fiction that is read for pure entertainment and the second half covers the real story of the Kid.  I would recommend this book if you are interested in the Kids story and you want to read every angle of his story 
 This book is really reserved for pattern's fans, because material inside is essentially focused on processes patterns, and design materials are expressed in a textual way. Anyway, some ideas are good to be kept aside,  but amount of such ideas don't justify the book size 
 Roger Ebert, a review I greatly respect and normally agree with, raved about this flick.  Roger, I love you, but you missed the boat on this one.  I'm not going to review the plot because it's been done by several reviewers already.  Suffice it to say, David Lynch didn't get enough of symbolism interpretation in freshman English ("Okay, class, who wants to discuss the meaning of the impaled pig's head on page 72 in Lord of the Flies?  David, how about you?") and now want to inflict it on you, the unwitting movie watching public.  Thanks, Mr. Lynch, but I'll pass.  I didn't enjoy figuring out the obscure symbolism in page after page of Crime and Punishment and I didn't enjoy it in scene after scene of Mulholland Drive.     To add insult to injury, Lynch prides himself on putting scenes in his movie that make absolutely no sense, rationalizing it by saying life often doesn't make sense.  This habit of his is less noticible in this film than, say, Twin Peaks, mostly because the whole film is for the most part senseless.  Yeah, it's true that a lot of things are absurd in my own life, but more along the lines of "...I would've won Powerball this week except I spent my lottery money on a scented candle at the RenFaire, what the heck was I thinking..." or "...I wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life watching this dumb movie, what the heck was I thinking..." but I've yet to be visited by scrawny cowboy or a wheelchaired dwarf.  I must live a sheltered life or something.  Lynch also forbids chapter cuts in his DVD, believing his movie must be watched in its entirety, or not at all (I'd advise the second.)  To be fair, in this case I don't think he's motivated entirely by a exaggerated sense of importance, but rather by the knowledge that every male, if given the chance, would overshoot most of the movie and focus on the hot chick on chick action.  C'mon all you 5 star givers, admit it!  You find the movie pretentious and silly, but the topless scenes more than make up for all the drippy pseudo-art!    To reiterate, if I wanted to see a boring and pointless dream sequence I'll rewatch Dallas - if I wanted to see a nice rack I'll take my top off and look in the mirror.  Who needs Mulholland Drive 
 Five crime stories. I read the first. Damn, ain't no way to solve the thing until you read the last page, and I waded through all kinds of cardboard cutouts and cliches to get there. I quit reading. 
 I am a huge fan of Karen Clark Sheard.  I have all of her Cds so I knew that if I bought this cd without listening to it first I would not be disappointed.  However, I was very disappointed after listening to it.  The only song that I really like is "Favor."  She is very talented and I love her voice and song arrangements.  I love her to death but this cd is just not working for me 
 The premise of this book is certainly nothing new, and the writing itself is nothing to write home about.  Benford spends a large number of pages telling very little story, with numerous uninteresting side-trips and distractions.  He also frequently switches between present tense and past tense randomly, and engages in long run-on sentences with no punctuation or capitalization - this must be considered "cool" in some writing circles, but as a reader, it is a great annoyance.  I certainly won't be bothering with any more in this series 
 Mark Galli's book helps to shed light upon Jesus's character -- instead of the "warm and fuzzy" Jesus some people follow, Jesus is portrayed as "not always nice", "demanding", "fear and shame-maker", "forsaker", "desire unfulfiller"....  Galli chooses to base each chapter on a different aspect of Jesus from 1-2 verses taken from the Gospel of Mark.  Some of what Galli writes fits with the verses chosen, but more often than not found that what he writes was really out of context with the entire passage the verses came from.    Many of the chapters made me feel uncomfortable -- not because the book was doing it's job of changing my perspective of Jesus -- but rather the author's stretching of the truth.  For example, he wrote "So we struggle with Jesus in such moments because he so willing employs shame and fear and physical intimidation to motivate people."  His quote refers to Mark 11:15-17.  None of the versions of the Bible mention this scenario with Jesus actually using "shame" tactics; it's the author's own interpretation.  My main concern is that someone who takes Galli's ideas to heart will become demanding, impatient, guilt-driven, mean followers of Jesus.  And not in a good way. 
 I am one of those 30something never-been-married women targeted by Whitebread. My parents divorced when I was twelve, and I was a latchkey kid. So I am very familiar with the social conditions that have created the "marriage delay" that's supposed to be so prevalent in my generation.  That said, I have to agree with some of the reviewers that the women interviewed in this book are unrealistic to only want well-to-do men that make - say - at least $100,000 per year. How many men like that really exist, especially these days when it's becoming harder and harder for anyone who's not a CEO of a Halliburton-type corporation to get wealthier each year? I wouldn't be surprised if it's a tiny shrinking percentage.  While I agree that you should only get married if you find the right person and never "settle," when it comes to financial status I have to make an exception.  There are lots of good men out there (I'm seeing one right now, he's not a well-to-do CEO type and I don't care). Most of them are just not going to be Donald Trumps.  Perhaps the real problem is not a lack of good men - or women - but too much emphasis on money and prestige 
 And folk revivalism is what it is, folks; I'll label it even if the populists fume at me because I know of more than 5 genres.  Meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the Fairport Convention, Pentangle, and above all Shirely Collins.  He even did an album of "covers" of Shirley Collins' arrangements of British traditionals, a ridiculous concept if I ever heard of one.  Why cover another singer's versions of TRADITIONAL songs?  This idiocy should evince Meloy's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of British folk music, and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition.  With no prosodic skill, he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as Shirley Collins' repertoire.  Evidently Meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a Walter Scott, S.T.C. or John Keats, but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an American desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie.  The wistfulness and Romantic nostalgia of Meloy's work come off as trite and calculated for NPR yuppies.  Moreover, his vocal range consists entirely of yelp, melancholy warble and nasal whine--this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold.  I'll admit the band is at least competent, but do yourself a favor: buy Comus' "First Utterance," the Incredible String Band's "The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter" or Shirley Collins' "No Roses" instead 
 The plane does not fly very good. When you crash the plane it is so heavy that it breaks the nose off  the tail section and the mid section. Not a very good design 
 Perhaps Dr. Mercola has some valuable insights; however, this book is way too convoluted in its writing. Who wants to trudge through the verbiage to get at the significant kernels? In addition, it is clear that anyone who cuts out grains and sugars is likely going to end up cutting out calories in the deal - that is probably the basic truth of this eating plan. The rest is hype-like. Are you willing to devote an immense portion of your time to food planning and preparation in pursuit of the demands of this diet? Just think, time you don't spend in the kitchen or in the grocery line is time you could be spending out exercising. When he writes, somewhere in the middle of the book, that if you are following the diet religiously and still not losing weight, then you should consider limiting your calories to 1000 per day. OKAY! What just happened here?  We've been switched to a low-calorie diet, only without grains! So, if you have a weight problem that just doesn't like to budge and a metabolism that just drags you through life, you may end up on the 1000 calorie diet plan, where you've been many times before. So try it, but save wasting your precious $$$$ on the book. It goes like this:  no grains, no sugars, no simple starches (potatoes, carrots, etc.), certain fruits only, most vegetables unless very starchy, meats, fish and poultry - preferably organic, butter, cream and cheese (all within reason, I suppose):  you'll need to read the book if you want more detail, certain good oils and no bad oils, almond butter sometimes, walnuts sometime, etc. Hey folks, it really is just plain old horse sense, you know this stuff anyway!! 
 "Nobody touches the Lonely Planet for budget travel advice," states the back cover of this book.   I just finished travelling around Southeast Asia with this as my primary guidebook. It includes the basics for getting around, eating, etc... but it really is just the basics. I have used other books from the lonely planet series in the past, and have found them good enough to continue using, at least until this volume. It has been 5 years since I was in this region last, and things have changed. Especially the guidebook, which was once a rich trove of off-the-beaten-path hints and tips. Increasingly, however, it seems that the Lonely Planet authors seem less interested in helping you find a unique experience and more interested in serving up a cookie-cutter, package tourist rehash. I have a couple grievances with this book:    -It insists on constantly pointing out little sidebars entitled "Splurge!" which indicate ways that the budget traveller can spend a great deal of money in one shot. Why this is in a travel guide called "shoestring" I couldn't tell you. Neither do the authors, but I suppose we can assume that backpackers are interested in spending $5 a night for a couple of months and then blowing $150 to stay in some posh hotel in Kuala Lumpur or racking up an additional $20 in credit card debt for an entirely forgettable dining experience in Bangkok. I just don't feel these are relevant to 99% of actual budget travellers, but they waste a lot of space that could be much better used on greater detail. But I will get to that in a minute.    -Another issue I have is the lack of actual information about actually moving from one place to the next cheaply.  Cheap local transport is available in many of the places covered in the book.  For some reason though, the book usually offers helpful advice like 'just take a cab,' or 'buses are so cheap, so don't bother with local transport.'  As an independent traveler that actually enjoys saving money AND spending time with the locals (what's the purpose of traveling again?!?!), I regret the lack of information about local transport.    -The maps in the book, though better than some in past editions, leave much to be desired. Streets are incorrectly labeled or in the wrong place, intersections are vaguely marked, and occasionally they add a street that doesn't exist or remove a street that does. Worst of all, in a region that prides itself on an almost complete lack of road signage, not many good landmarks are given to orient oneself. There is little that is less fun on the road than standing in front of a train station, staring at one's new alien surroundings, being hassled by touts who are trying to steer you in the wrong direction while trying to find that cheap hostel you read about.    Look, if you want a run-of-the-mill book to complete a run-of-the-mill trip, by all means, you will find this book quite helpful.  But if you are looking for that individual experience that is the beauty of independent travel, you might be best going with a different guide for this region.    By the way, the quote I wrote at the beginning should be viewed as a warning rather than an enticemen 
 I picked this book up as part of a package for attending a speech by Mr. Stalk who is VP at the influential Boston Consulting Group. More so than his book, his speech was jaw dropping, hard-line, 80's corporate raider stuff... all based on a core principle that makes sense, businesses have a primary objective of meeting the needs of their customers and shareholders. Beyond this simple concept, everything else is good will to the community. This ongoing principle was easy for me to accept and I have to say I reflected on some of my opinions of different businesses (WalMart, Starbucks). That being said, the majority of this book is written to CEOs and their advisors with influence over an organization's objectives. This was where I was confused on being invited to this speaking engagement, this is subject matter that is higher up the chain than I can influence right now. However, I did take away some understanding of why corporate leadership makes the decisions they do and am tossing around how these concepts can be scaled down to the departmental level 
 I read this book many years ago, and thought it was terrible.  Looking through the reviews just now, I couldn't believe how overwhelmingly positive they were, and just had to put in a word for those of us (and I assume/hope there are others) who didn't like the book.  The book is ludicrously long, and meanders through way too many red herrings, dead ends, and nonsequitirs.  There are any number of sub-plots that appear out of nowhwere, go nowhere, never pay off, and leave you wondering why you had to take the time to read through them at all.  The sub-plots, though, are nothing like as much of a problem as the main plot itself.  It's a very uninspiring story about a business deal.  Will person A get the contract, or will person B?  A business deal?  Who cares?  SPOILER ALERT:  And then, after sitting through thousands of pages boringly building up to the big deal, at the end one of the characters randomly dies, and the whole thing just peters out.  No climax, no drama, nothing.  I also respectfully disagree with the reviewers who praised the characters.  I found that Clavell has a bad habit of making his characters too perfect, carried out too far in this book.  All of the major characters are the greatest golfer and an olympic diver and the greatest gourmet and a brilliant business person and so on and so on.  These are not real people, they're supermen who I couldn't relate to at all.  It's boring, it's long, it's badly written.  I was particularly disappointed because I loved Shogun and liked Tai-pan and King Rat.  But after this one, I've never read another Clavell book, and I don't think I will 
 If you need a guidebook that will help you plan an itinerary, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! This book, while chock-full of information, gives no practical tips whatsoever about how to arrange activities while touring. I read through it twice and came away with snippets of information but nothing that helped with actually planning how my family would spend each of our four days in the city. The index is incomplete and much of the information is sketchy at best. I would NOT recommend this as a resource, especially for first-time visitors 
 Pity the student using this textbook for a Differential Equations course. The Boyce & DiPrima text is unduly cumbersome with lacking explanation and poorly choosen examples throughout.   Many problems given in the text are tedious, and are indicated as being "technologically intensive." This is fine: in today's workplace, one can anticipate using a computer to solve problems. Unfortunately, none of my math professors will let me bring out my laptop on an exam. In some of the chapters, almost every problem is indicated as being "technologically intensive." If the computer-oriented problems weren't bad enough, the examples in the text are. Most of these are sorely unclear. I think that Boyce & DiPrima must have been writing in Fermat's marginal notes style when composing this text. Many times the omitted steps (which the authors sometimes regard as "it is clear that") require substantial algebraic and calculus manipulation to achieve the indicated results. Certainly I have no qualms about a text leaving out algebraic or even trigonometric simplifications, but what's left out of the Boyce & DiPrima examples is truely excessive. Worse, still, the examples are often very generic to a single type of problem. Thus, while one type of problem in the exercises might have good examples to instruct students on how to achieve solutions, the rest of the exercises often lack example altogether. Explanation and orientation to applied math is poor. The authors jump suddenly from a confusing theory discourse to an application without bridging the two. Many times I was left puzzled by how the text was proceeding. Still many more times I set the book aside in frustration.  This book does, however, have redeeming values. I like how all of the problems have their solutions provided in the back. If only other math textbook authors took the hint: students won't know how well they're doing if they cannot confirm their results! Also, the included software is good. I found it easy to use and helpful for the computing problems. I wish, however, more attention was given to this software in the text (like small projects using the software with each chapter). These benefits unfortunately do not overcome the tremendous flaws with the Boyce & DiPrima text.  Overall, this is one of the worst math books I have encountered. Rife with poor explanation, a confusing style, and poor exercise sets, the Boyce and DiPrima textbook is bound to cause grief for most students. The student's solution manual is helpful, but offers only little more explanation than the textbook. If you are hapless enough to have this text as a course requirement, I recommend that you either swap classes to try and get a course with a different book - or - be prepared to spend many long hours with tutors or your professor.  Good luck.  [... 
 I remember seeing this film with my uncle of mine. I really didn't like the film to much. The film wasn't really like his other 80's films. The story line was really slow not much of an action movie. This movie was more like a "ladys soap opera" rather thin a action movie. IMO  Dont get me wrong there was acouple of parts in the film that were awesome but still the movie wasn't that good. I dont suggest picking up the DVD unless your a big collector on Vanddame stuff 
 I bought this coffee machine in October 2006 from Amazon after reading the reviews on this page, and I knew that some users had problems with the coffee leaking over the sides and onto the hot plate. But I figured that it was only happening to some of the customers and some of the time.   This coffee maker makes great coffee and it looks good on our counter.  But this coffee machine needs constant supervision because, at least in our case, it will drizzle/drool/leak over the sides and onto the hotplate and frequently in enough volume to also go over the edge of the plate and all over the counter. If we set it up to make a 6 cup pot and go off to have a shower, we frequently come back to a mess on the counter top, because at least a cup of coffee has not made it into the carafe. And as someone noted, it's impossible to figure out how to resolve the problem. We have looked at the "drip stop" mechanism in the basket, and there's nothing obvious here. We've looked at the top of the carafe and there's nothing there either. You can seat and re-seat the carafe and sometimes it will work, and and other times a disaster. Today we are simply staying in the kitchen to watch the entire pot brew, as the leaking can occur at anytime in the brewing cycle, not just at the start. I am now so annoyed that I am writing the company to tell them how annoying this is. And I buying a new coffee maker. I am not sure Amazon will allow me to return the machince, but I will try. Buy something else unless you really like troubleshooting a design that needed a bit more beta testing before it was  ready for production 
 BODY MODS ARE NOT MUTILATION. this author was very ignoran 
 Cantwell's volume represents everything I hate in a book about music.   Pompous and pretentious pseudo-revelatory academic blather about folk  music.  Compare and contrast Cantwell's account with the genuinely readable  and insightful history by Neil Rosenberg.  As I recall there's a blurb on  the cover comparing this work with Greil Marcus' brilliant Mystery  Train....well, hardly, not even in the same league.  Here's a rule of thumb  for books on various genre's of music, as you read the volume do you seek  out the recordings or performances discussed by the author?  Nothing in  Bluegrass Breakdown moved me to explore artists or styles.  This is a book  by one of those academics who is more intereted in showing the reader just  how much he's learned about this quaint folk music.  In a word...annoying 
 This book is a waste of time. It's interpretations of the symbols of the Tarot are largely unfounded and/or intuitive lunging. As for its treatment on the Tarot's history, this author has apparently thrown her arms up in the "we'll never know" hokum-dance all too often encountered.  So I can slam it, but can I recommend a better source? Sure. Try "The Tarot: History, Symbolism, and Divination" instead, for instance. Or even a moderate degree of personal, serious, research.  You would do better than to accept the speculative retardation presented in books like this. Please. Seriously. This books deserves ZERO stars 
 Totally disappointing.  From the beginning the novel read well, but like a Sherlock Holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue .  I, personally, do not like reading this type of mystery....I want clues.  Alas, there were none.  Also, the characters did not make sense.....most were too undeveloped.....Mr. Patterson needs to go back to the drawing board & try to forget the $$$ he is being paid up front by the publisher 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 I recently bought this card to add on to my HP desktop computer. The card went in easy enough, but that's when the problems started. I put in the disk that came with the card, but over and over my computer wouldn't recognize the card or the program on the disk. I kept having problems occur one after another and other programs starting to fail due to this mess. After almost losing the computer on the second occasion, I was forced to take the card out of the computer. All problems ended immediately! I've had no problems with Belkin's cords and wires, but their cards and hubs, I've had nothing but trouble. Do yourselves a favor and don't get this item. It could cause you nothing but your entire computer to crash. It's not worth your hard earned money to see your computer crash and burn, is it? If you need to add a card, find yourselves a different brand. I, myself, am going to try Adaptec. Hopefully that one won't cause me the problems that I have gotten with this one 
 Be Careful! It is just a CD including an Excel File. You need to have two other add-ins installed to run the file. I can't judge how flexible this model is. But I couldn't apply this to my current valuation class in MBA program 
 I never would have believed that someone could talk so much without having anything to say. I'm positively amazed.  I've waded through this book for hours trying to find even a shred of a concept among the heaped piles of trivia, irrelevancies, flawed arguments, bold and baseless assertions, large amounts of poorly analyzed information and fantastically impractical propositions, not to mention the incessant repetitions of said.   The fact is, this book contains neither illuminating theories nor useful practical suggestions, but only seemingly random (albeit grammatically compatible) sentences strung together in what must be the most extravagant display of Da-Da intellectualism to ever see print.   For example, after stating that on the one hand, the merging of games and stories seems natural and desirable, and on the other hand it has proven more difficult than expected (by whom?), the author treats us to this piece of sublime poetry:  "The quest to find a way to combine storytelling and gaming has all the qualities of a great story or game: there's a noble goal to be achieved, difficulties to overcome through understanding and insight, and success to be won by the careful use of skill, planning and execution".  This self-indulgent babble fills the book's pages to the point of choking. Another episode of it is exemplified when the author is considering the proper term to call users of his "participatory storytelling" idea, kindly sharing his profound thinking processes with the reader:  "What shall we call the people participating in these stories? I like players; someone taking part in a game is called a player, as is a performer in a play or film. Since a person participating in a story environment is doing a bit of each activity, the term "player" seems both fitting and economical".  Thanks to Mr. Glassner for his enlightening elucidations.  Later in the book, the author arrives at a conclusion that several difficulties that he claims to be inherent to interactive storytelling require the transition to a new aesthetic goal, which he calls "participatory storytelling". In addition to the fact that it is impossible to yield from this text either an intelligent overview of these difficulties, a coherent argument as to the superiority of "participatory storytelling", or even a solid definition of it, it seems the author has actually no grasp of the considerations relating to the subject matter. Mr. Glassner suggests, for example, the use of a fantastic science fiction technology he calls "living masks". A living mask, we are told, is a form of "interpreter" assigned to the player, who translates that player's input into the story world, transforming it into a more professional performance. In other words, this "mask" is supposed to be able to understand the player's intention, and then express it in a way that is more theatrical and more "in character" than a non-professional player would be able (or, Mr. Glassner claims, would want) to achieve. A computer rephrasing a human's speech to be more theatrical! Changing his tone to express more emotion! Manipulating his facial expressions to be more like "professional" acting! If this is at all possible, which is in doubt, this technology would certainly consume lifetimes to achieve!    But technology is not the only thing that the author seems to have no grasp of. Not by a long shot. The book drudges through an exhausting overview of what differentiates stories from games (Based, of course, on the mislead assumption that Story + Game = Interactive Storytelling). Since this comparison is about as appropriate as asking what differentiates a symphony from a papaya, Mr. Glassner has to invent some highly imaginative points of comparison which, other than providing an opportunity for several obscene atrocities committed against the English language as regards the definition of certain terms, stretched beyond recognition to be applicable to both stories and games, like the claim that both stories and games have a "referee" of some sort, have very little value. But even within his own twisted semantics, he simply doesn't seem to grasp the core concepts. When comparing the rules of games to those of stories, he focuses on stories, saying that their rules are hard to define because they are dependant on many practicalities - the laws of physics, the capabilities of the characters, or the ramifications of some actions. He's got it all backwards - all of these are the exact considerations which decide the rules of computer games. Stories, all stories, have one, and only one constant and inescapable set of rules - the rules of narrative.   It seems Mr. Glassner's understanding of interactivity is no better than his understanding of storytelling or games. He bemoans what he calls "The Myth of Interactivity: more interactivity makes any experience better". It's hard to say who exactly Mr. Glassner thinks are the subscribers to this "myth". After all, I've yet to hear someone express a wish that food or music, for example, were interactive, however that could possibly be achieved, yet these activities are among those most enjoyed by people the world over.  The examples given by Mr. Glassner serve both to undermine his point as to the overestimation of interactivity and to demonstrate that he, himself, has no idea of what interactivity is:  "Interactivity itself is hardly novel or interesting: an ATM is interactive... and the automatic doors in front of a supermarket are interactive. The whole world is filled with interactive experiences, from waving down a cab to sharpening a pencil".  For all of these activities save the last, the author is correct in claiming that they are, strictly speaking, interactive. The part about the pencil sharpening is outright puzzling. However, all these activities are perfect examples of why increased interactivity is better: first, they are the simplest, silliest forms of interactivity. Supporting a claim to the overestimation of interactivity with these examples is like supporting a claim to the overestimation of reading with the example of bumper stickers. Furthermore, each and every one of these activities could be improved with more interactivity. The interaction with an ATM would be much more interesting if, for example, it gave you financial advice instead of just spewing out cash, listening to your concerns and recommending a proper course of action. A door at the supermarket would be much more interesting if you could ask it for directions to the different products you're looking for, and a cab ride is improved immeasurably if you have an engaging conversation with the driver. Improve the interactivity of these experiences, and you improve their value (To learn more about interactivity, read Chris Crawford's book on the subject, and while you're at it, read his one on interactive storytelling, too).    What passes for a main argument in this forgettable book is that interactivity and stories conflict because stories are meticulously construed by master craftsmen and therefore cannot brook interference from the audience without being destroyed. And since this "interference" is the essence of interactivity, the two are incompatible. If Mr. Glassner were correct, which he most certainly is not, then it would be impossible to wed the two - this would be a shotgun marriage with neither party gaining anything, and the only question being how much each would lose on behalf of the other. As Mr. Glassner would have it, the interactive part would lose dramatically while the story would lose little (The storyteller retains control of the main characters, their actions and emotions, with the players making secondary contributions). An understandable position for a screenwriter.  However, what the author fails to see is that story and interactivity can actually be combined in a way that benefits both parties instead of simply making both lose their soul. This, however, requires a major paradigm shift because it is simply impossible to deal with the concept in the terms of current artistic media. The result will be nothing like traditional games and it will be nothing like traditional stories. It will have a different contract between storyteller and audience than that Mr. Glassner is howling like a frenzied fundamentalist to preserve, and it will have a very different kind of interactivity than that of a computer game, let alone the sports games that Mr. Glassner seems so interested in for some reason (being, is it were, the farthest thing from relevant to the subject which can still be termed "game"), and it will have a very different definition for the role of storyteller - to create a system of narrative possibilities out of which hundreds of thousands of moving and powerful stories can be constructed using the user's input. Is it possible? Yes. Do we have the technology? Yes. Will Mr. Galssner's book take us any closer to it? Don't bet on it.              After having despaired and having been irritated beyond measure in my attempts to extract even a modicum of benefit or interest from this oversized doorstop, I literally threw it away with force. Avoid doing the same with your time and money. 
 In this book, Michael Moorcock, being of the breed of fantasy author who has tried so desperately to come off as a "real" writer because everyone looks at fantasy writers as juvenille hacks, discusses at length his windbag opinions about the current state of fantasy fiction as well as its past. The essays contained within this book are long-winded, pretentious rubbish that should be avoided by everyone except diehard Michael Moorcock fans. This guy has the gall to bash guys like Tolkien and Robert E.Howard, thinking he's some kind of literary genius because of his teen-fave Elric books that are supposed to be so deep and introspective but in reality are nothing more than over-worded, whiny drivel unpalatable by anyone over the age of 25. Spare us, Mr. Moorcock. The Elric books are the only half-decent thing you've ever written, and you've been riding on the fame you accrued from them ever since. Get over yourself. You're not that great a writer and a little modesty would do you a lot of good 
 This album is extremely attractive and informative and has storage space for a complete set of 100 quarters (both P and D mint marks for each state). Unfortunately, it's a nightmare to use.   You'd think the U.S. mint would know what size their own coins are and be able to make an album they would actually fit in, wouldn't you? Well, guess again! It's just about bloody impossible to get quarters all the way into these slots so that they're firmly lodged and don't fall right back out again. I have only found two ways to accomplish this: 1) pound on the coins with a heavy object (obviously a disaster for preserving either them OR the album in good condition) or 2) painstakingly shave away a little bit of the cardboard around the edge of each slot (extremely tedious and time-consuming, as well as very hard to do without puncturing the flimsily thin backing material).   I am now in the process of shopping for an album that doesn't require me to risk damaging my quarters in order to get them into it. When I get one, this thing will go straight into the recycling bin. I couldn't bring myself to inflict it on some other unsuspecting person.  P.S. No offense to Burton W. Ostrower, but I think he MUST have been reviewing a different album. Mine does not have a "top plastic cover," and the coins are NOT viewable from both sides as he said. (I wish!) I would report the inaccuracy to Amazon if I knew how, because I hate to see people be misled. But the report form only allows reporting of "inappropriate" material, and there's no place to write comments there 
 "The Best of A Flock of Seagulls" is a greatest hits collection for the synth-pop group A Flock of Seagulls.   Many people consider A Flock of Seagulls a one-hit wonder band because they basically had one hit "I Ran".   However, this probably is an unfair statement because this group actually won a grammy award for the instrumental song "D.N.A." and they did score another hit back in England with the song "Wishing (If I Had a Photographh of You).    The "Best of A Flock of Seagulls" contains all of these songs plus another 9 songs.   It does an excellent job of capturing the hits from the group during the period of 1982 through 1985.   This period also coincides with the peak period of the synth-pop era of the 1980s.  As the synth-pop era began to fade into oblivion, so did A Flock of Seagulls.  For a greatest hits collection, there are probably two ways it can be judged.  The first is on the actual music itself and how good the music sounds.   The second way is simply on how good a job the collection compiles the hits.   "The Best of A Flock of Seagulls" does a pretty good job at capturing the music from the various albums of 1982 through 1985.   The collection takes songs from the first four albums.  These albums are: the self-titled "A Flock of Seagulls;  "Listen"; "The Story of a Young Heart"; and "Dream Come True" (each subsequent album listed seems to get harder to find - with the "Dream Come True" album almost impossible to get).    The collection also does a nice job at balancing the music.   But in the first area on how good the music sounds - this is where I have some doubts.   It is not that I am anti-Synth-Pop.  In fact there are many Synth-Pop bands I like.   As for A Flock of Seagulls,  they have some moments with some really good melodies, but despire the catchy lyrics, the vocal tracks leave a lot to be desired.   I almost think while Mike Score has some interesting vocals, they just don't overwhelm you anywhere.  One place where A Flock of Seagulls really shines is in the instrumental area.    D.N.A. is a track that does a great job at showing this.   It won a grammy award for an instrumental for a reason - it is pretty good.   "The Story of a Young Heart" is the title track from the third album.   This song has a very good (long) instrumental intro.   This song has more of a new-wave feel to it and it probably is an underrated song.  The hit song "I Ran" came along at the right time.   This was a song from the self-titled debut album when the Synth-Pop movement was in full swing.   This song seemed to fit the Synth-Pop movement like a glove - great keyboards and catchy lyrics.  In addition the song had a perfect theme for the "Space Invaders" period - it dealt with a Close Encounter of the Third Time.  "I Ran" seems to have all of the characteristics of a legendary song - and in some ways the song is legendary based on all of the reasons described.   But there is one problem with the song - it wears on you and will wear on you pretty quickly.  In some ways, the song is the epitomy of the one-hit wonder.    The "space theme" continues with the second song - "Space Age Love Song".  This was the song that followed "I Ran" on the self-titled debut album.   Although it has the "Space Age" in it, there really isn't anything related to the "Space Age" other than the sound.   This song actually is pretty good.    It is kind of the opposite of "I Ran" in one way - this will be the kind of song you listen to a few times and it will grow on you - although I wouldn't go as far to say that you will be addicted to this song.   There will be some good drum (machine) sounds to close out the song.  Again, the vocals don't impress.    The third song (also from the self-titled debut album) "Telecommunication" continues the techo-theme.   It is here where the album begins to wear on you.  The song "The More You Live, The More You Love" is from the second album, "Listen".  This is an interesting song - it has a similar sound to "Space Age Love Song".  This song will also slowly grow on you.  Like "Space Age", I don't think this will be a song you get addicted to.  The collection contains two versions of "Wishing (I Had a Photograph of You)".   The sixth track is the version of "Wishing" that was released on the "Listen" album.  The 11th track is a nine minute extended version of the song (probably released as a 12" song).    Each of these two versions have a nice catchy beat, but the vocals just don't overwhelm me in these songs.   The extended version has some good instrumental pieces that the original doesn't have.  As for the other songs on the collection, I wouldn't do handstands for them.  This collection has a horrible set of liner notes.   All that is contained inside the liner notes is a list of the songs.  The dates and producers of the songs are listed, but there is nothing that credits the album that the song is from.   The center of the liner notes contain black and white photos of the four album covers.   That is basically it.   There is nothing else.  No instrumental credits, no songwriting credits - the members of the band are not even listed.     It would have been nice to have a small writeup about the band.   All in all, while it does a nice job at putting a collection of the songs - this disappoints me, but more from the perspective of the band.  You still may want to check this out if you really love the band. 
 it is juust a copy of the frist book. if you read the frist the world is flat, then don't waste your time. jo 
 When I first picked up "Tomb of the Inflatable Pig", I was blown away. I'd never even thought about Paraguay until I'd read that book and I'll still maintain that it's one of the best travel books I've come accross. So "Theatre of Fish" comes as something of a disappointment.   Put simply, it's very dull. Occasional descriptions of massacres are interesting but generally it show none of the verve or humour of his first one.  Frankly I've only read half way and I'm having trouble trying to finish it.   If you've read his first book then avoid this one like the plague. You'll be shattered. 
 this industry is "goin down"    u call this an album???  LO 
 Any old fool could put this garbage together. The 5-star raters are all deaf from listening to too much of this rubbish! Just find a chopper pad somewhere and sit by it if you want the stuff for free - or perhaps point an electric drill at your eardrums. Even Cage would not approve. Minus 5 stars 
 Have read several Leonard books and this may be the worst one I have read. The two so called "bad men" remind me of my self if I tried to do what they did. NOTHING goes right. Ordell Robbie and Louis Gara grab Mickey Dawson, wife of Frank Dawson, to hold for ransom. Frank could care less. He has a mistress and does not want his wife back. This makes Mickey very upset and she decides she wants part of the action with Ordell and Louis. Meanwhile, the mistress decides she wants to be part of their plan too. You will meet crazy Richard, who likes to shoot people. There was page after page of just talk. Nothing happening. I kept thinking it would get better but no such luck. If you are having trouble sleeping try this book 
 While I enjoy Greenberg's radio show, I was extremely disappointed in this book.  Throughout the book, Greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio.  Unfortunately, unlike on the radio, when Mike Golic is always available to slap some sense into Greenberg, this book is purely 100% Greenberg.  I am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives, yet try to act like they have "struggled" in life.  Greenberg has had to "struggle" thru a cushy upbringing, going to exclusive schools such as Northwestern and eventually landing his gig at ESPN.  For those of you in the Chicago area, I hope that you caught Debra Pickett's article on Greenberg in the Chicago Sun-Times.  While Greenberg professes to be a family man, the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic, himself, while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool.  Keeping with his privileged existence, the pool was located at the East Bank Club in Chicago, yet another privileged club to which Greenberg belongs.  I should receive a refund for slopping thru this "book."  Hopefully, this review will prevent other people from making the mistake I did.  ESPN should fire this wimpy "meterosexual" for writing this book.  
 I've read several of Block's novels but this was my first exposure to his hit  man character, Keller. None of these stories (each chapter is a separate story) are, well, very interesting. There is very little suspense or anticipation of what will happen next. Before you can care one way or the other about his victims, they're dead. Not much build up or background - they're like cardboard people that we don't get to know much about.  Even the methods Keller uses are mundane.   I was expecting more of an edgy personality in a profesional killer. Keller is just a boring guy whose obsession is stamp collecting. The more interesting sections are his interactions with his agent, Dot. However she's another flat character. If Block had dug a little deeper into the lives of these two, he might have captured my interest more. I just never felt engaged by either the characters or the stories. It was a disappointing read from a talented writer 
 This DVD was a total disappointment.  First of all, this video was a rip off of Baby Genius series, but without the production value.  Second, this video promises to introduce your child to fruits and vegetables and healthy eating habits.  To be fair, there are fruits and vegetables, but not so cleverly disguised in this video you will find dead and burned animals (grilled turkeys etc.) and rotten milk (in other term cheese), chicken period (eggs), ice cream ( I think it's a child abuse to feed your 6 month old ice cream!) and other non-fruit and non-vegetable foods.  This video shows a toddler chewing on a hunk of parmasan cheese that's bigger than baby's head!  I believe it is morally right to properly advertise your product and not misrepresent what your product has to offer, especially when it comes to offering children first look at health and nutrition.  I would NOT recommend this video for vegetarians, vegans, or other parents looking to teach their children proper health and eating habits. 
 I ordered the product and thought I was getting the large size.  I called the shipper, no returned calls and I can't really use the item shipped as I needed the large item.    How do I return, the shipper doesn't return the calls.  Not a happy customer of this product 
 I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much.  All taboos have been broken there is nothing left.  Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore 
 "Grub" opens by poking fun at people who get "cranky when the goat cheese isn't served at room temperature", or are "fond of restaurants that serve chocolate-covered edamame", and then goes on to gleefully serve up recipes such as "Yucca Chowder", a recipe which by itself calls for a dizzying list of exotic ingredients including yucca, "kombu", "recao", saffron, and okra.  What is the point of lecturing for half the book about using locally grown foods, and then offering recipes crawling with uncommon or downright bizarre ingredients?  Where the hell am I supposed to get locally produced plantains, black rice, and pine nuts in southern Michigan?  Should I buy my "kombu" organic?  Perhaps I should skip down to the farmer's market for the ingredients for their "Picadillo-Stuffed Chayote with Rutagaga-Garlic Sauce."  Failing that, I suppose I can always go collect some "seitan" (what the hell is it anyway?) from my vegetable garden.  It has been a long time since I read Diet for a Small Planet (written by the author's mother) but I seem to recall simple, nutritious recipes made from a minimal list of recognizable ingredients.  If the child of that heritage has grown to believe that this sort of nonsense is sensible, then the whole foods movement she claims to champion is indeed doomed to failure.   
 Beautiful graphics and nice storyline, but the amount of times the game freezes or you receive an error is just awful! Not to mention, the monsters level up with you so you'll never be at an advantage. You could pretty much beat the game at level 5  
 I'm unfamiliar with some of the other bands mentioned but to compare Eric Matthews to Elvis Costello is just silly.  Matthews has a poor voice and really has nothing to say on any of these songs.  The pompous review on the liner notes that all other music is irrelevant now that Eric Matthews has come along really annoyed me.  I just found this album boring-good thing i paid [$$] for it 
 THE ROUGH GUIDE TO CULT MOVIES does, in its presentation, follow in the footsteps of what has been a successful formula for Rough Guide books. This guide is a thematic guide to movies in general. The book consists of over 80 categories of movies such as: animals, b-movies, cops, doctors, fantasy, horror, musicals, prison, serial killers, zombies, etc. Each category has a selection of movies which, for the most part, fit the subject. There are also various sidelights thrown into different categories which expand upon the actors, writers, directors, etc. Unforunately, although there is a spattering of cult movies included, most of the films covered are standard fare movies which fit the category. Additional mistakes, such as the wrong year for a movie, are to be found on occasion. The selection of movies for some categories appears almost random with gaping exclusions (the category for zombies lists CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD but excludes DAWN OF THE DEAD and Fulci's ZOMBIE; the category for 3-D lists JAWS 3-D but excludes COMIN' AT YA IN 3-D). Additionally, any information provided for a movie includes: title, director, abbreviated cast, and a short description, which in most cases is shorter than what you can find in a video review guide. If you are looking for a general introduction to popular films in a thematic presentation, that can be found in this book. If you are looking for a book about actual cult films and any kind of discussion about them or their particulars, it is not to be found here 
 This book has a bad habit of being weak and juvenille.  Very weak and ordinary. G 
 This movie is more dark comedy and trippy foreign bizarrovision film than dyed-in-the-wool Zombie Fest.     If you were like me, who isn't well versed in the foreign horror movie scene, this movie was entertaining, but not what I'd consider something I'd add to the library (thanks NetFlix).  One thing I've found with Italian horror movies.....they spend alot of effort on visual trippery, seems they want every Italian movie to be an art film, and this is no exception (same goes for the Argento films of the past).  Its not a bad thing, just a distinctive style that you either buy into, or you do not.  An awful lot of strange things happen for no real apparrant reason :)  A little bit of sex (again, in that erotic italian artsy style), a bumbling mentally retarded sidekick, and a whole lot of strange, implausable things happening.  And then eventually, the movie ends.  The story is definately more love story / dark comedy..its entertaining, has a few minutes of zombie suspense but its almost wrong to call this a horror film, because its really not.    
 A simple plot about an ex-FBI officer forced by an old friend to infiltrate a Mob who murdered his son.Definitley not Arnie's best but it does have the odd good scene where his driving a convertable and shooting people at the same time while listening to the Rolling Stones "Satisfaction" but it was really corny how his car was riddled with bullets and didn't even get a flesh wound and of course he shot everyone.There wasn't many beautiful women in it and I think I prefer the shootout scene at the end of "Commando" to this.But I think he played his character reasonably well 
 Try as I might I just could not find humor in this book.  So many times I wanted to put this book down and walk away but I thought, "This must get better."  It didn't.  LaFlam's character is spiritual selfish and so many times I felt offended reading this book.  There are so many twists and turns in this book that it seems like a Christian version of the Jerry Springer show.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants an enjoyable read, because for me it was not.  I apologize to the author for my harsh words, but I was very disappointed in this work 
 This book was dissapointing because the authors political and religious views permeate what is otherwise a very positive model for fathering.  I'm sure Kevin is a great father, but not everyone is a Republican and/or Christian and you don't have to be either of these to be a good father 
 Although the authors are clearly very well versed in forensic anthropology, I was disappointed in the way they presented their material. The chapters weren't difficult to follow, but they read like memoirs of the authors' cases and I got the sense the authors were more interested in showing off than sharing knowledge with nonscientists. That  made it tricky to isolate details, and frankly I've learned more from general crime scene books that devoted just one chapter to forensic anthropology. Bottom line: If you're looking for a solid reference book that you can turn to again and again, you'll probably find satisfaction only in the glossary at the end 
 What I didn't realise when I ordered this is that it is an publication of a US kennel association.  It is a slim book, gives a good, realistic overview of kenneling from a management perspective, and is a good thing to read if you need to decide basic questions like "is the kennel business for me?" and "what are the main issues in kennel management?"  Its orientation is toward large kennels (65+ dogs) in the US.  For someone like me, who is thinking about a small kennel in Australia, it was interesting, but not really worth its pricetag 
 This book illustrates the difference between important and merely influential. It virtually invented the vague/portentious prose style that signifies boredom and alienation, and appeared as late as 1996 on the liner notes of Rage Against the Machine's "Evil Empire".  But it isn't very good. The dimestore existentialism aged, badly. Didion's spare writing now seems phony and juvenile. The same characters experiencing the same emotions have been rehashed so many times, often in superior forms, that what was innovative in the seventies doesn't really cut it anymore. Not that it was very original in its time, coming as it did after thirty years of Sartre and ten of Antonioni. Not to mention Horace McCoy's terrific 1935 novel "They Shoot Horses Don't They", popularized in a Hollywood film (coincidentally?) only a year before "Play It"'s publication.  A minor footnote to a still-evolving trend 
 This book is hopelessly outdated (as are my own), so I can't rate it any higher; but at least this guy is sincere. Some of the other reviewers act as if they expected the keys to the kingdom for under 20 bucks. And L Roc from Chi-town certainly got up on the wrong side of the crab dolly, except, of course, for hyping another book. In an age when you can buy your own production and editing equipment for under $10K, you don't need the strategies in this book or any other--save your money for tape stock--or to listen to the nay-sayers 
 This book does have a lot of info for its size.  In my opinion it just has your typical memory items that you should already know from your pilot training.  Items such as alcohol consumption and required VFR equipment should not have to be looked up by a current pilot.  Overall the book has a ton of info in it but not really anything you should need while flying and if you were studying at home there are much better books for studying 
 Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book 
 I hate traditional sunscreen that tends to be oily and heavy.  I liked the idea of sheer light feel of Neutrogena.  So I tried both Neutrogena Ultra Sheer SPF 30 and 45.  As soon as I applied the product, I felt a strong burning sensation throughout my entire face.  Not some tingly sensation that is associated with some products.  It felt like my face was on fire.  I immediately washed it off.  It still hurt.  I had to cool it with cold water to numb the pain.  Next day, my face was pink throughout and my skin still hurt.  I have tried variety of products, Cetaphil, Purpose, Alba, Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clarines, Chanel, Clinique, and many over the counter products typically found in any drug store.  I have never had such reaction.  Note, I don't have a sensative skin.  My skin tends to be normal with a little shine to T zone.  My mom, who has dry skin, tried the products.  She also complained that it hurt to use either SPF 30 or 45.  I had to throw them away.  Don't waste your money.      
 This book is awful.  The revisions to it are updated, but to follow the book in order is nearly impossible.  This is a text book being used at a college.  The information in this book is scattered and makes learning the concepts difficult.  I do not recommend this book for use at colleges/universities.  There has to be another book out there that allows users to learn the concepts and terminology in an easier fashion. 
 This is pro-Albanian propaganda. Nobody knows about the Albanians' "ethnic cleansing" of the Serbs that went on for the past 30 years. Serbs were driven out of their homes by the Albanian mafia and nobody could do anything about it because the communist government allowed it to go on unpunished. Nobody even talks about the Albanians that were killed by other Albanians because they believed that an independent state of Kosovo was not in the best interest of the Albanians. UN investigators that were sent into Kosovo after the recent bombing found only 2,200 bodies in mass graves. They didn't even know how many of those bodies were Serbs and how many were anti-secession Albanians. When this report was released, the US state department lowered its figure of 100,000 Albanians dead to 10,000 Albanians dead. If you want a better perspective from a more reliable source. Watch "Children of Kosovo: 2000" it shows the perspective of the children of Kosovska Mitrovica, which has both Albanians and Serbs living in it. It's made by a famous Hungarian film-maker so you cannot think that it is directed to any one side 
 A Christian Fundamentalist interpretation of Islam as the Beast of Revelation. There are better sources for an understanding of the relationship between Christianity and Islam 
 I thought the quilts were a repeat/reiteration of those selected for Quilt National.  Cold. repetitive and minimalist.  
 The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.  And I'm a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out. 
 Mandy, Mandy, Mandy.  This debut album from the versatile Broadway (Sunday in the Park with George) and Movie (The Princess Bride) star might shock you, and so may this review.  Mr Patinkin's range is exceptional, and the way he floats with ease into his upper-register is breath-taking.  His falsetto!  Stunning!  His emoting!  Stunning!  This solo debut!  Stunning!  By that, I mean that I was stunned by this solo debut.  Mr Patinkin has the bloodiest sleeve in the industry with this album.  Take a listen to it, but be warned; you just may cringe from the amount of open heart running down his sleeve, because there's a lot of it, and it's free-flowing.   He introduces us to his emotional state of mind with "Over the Rainbow" the standard that to this day has never been done better than by Ms Judy Garland, post-Oz.  It's a nice rendition of it, but you can hear him almost congratulating himself for having such a beautiful voice.  In my mind, I envision his voice on the ceiling of the room with Patinkin reaching towards the ceiling trying to make love to it, literally wrapping his body around it, coiling in it and then popping out every now and then as if arising from extasy with a hefty, sigh of passion.  And this takes the fun out of his performance.  I thought that this would be kept minimal on this CD.  I was wrong.  Arriving at Sondheim's "Pretty Lady," I realized that he's very much in love with his voice.  He loves it so much that he uses it as 3 different people, overlapping in harmony.  This is one of the most memorable numbers from Pacific Overtures, and I liked the Original Broadway Cast version much better.  He did, however, keep his emoting to a minimum on this track.  Then it hit me.  Full force.  I could hear the opening of the Sondheim standard, "No More."  I love this song.  It is my favorite song in "Into the Woods."  In the show, it's a song about greed, running away from your problems, loss, and generally breaks my heart everytime I see the show, or listen to the never-outdone Original Broadway Cast recording.  It's about yearning and hoping, and even a loss of hope.  Mandy Patinkin ruined this song.  I'm not going to paint a pretty picture about what he did to this song, but it is awful.  His emoting is like a brick wall of hearts thrown at my face.  The laughing at the end of phrases is so planned and intentional that it brings to mind the word "pretention."  This is such a tender song occurring soon after the Baker's Wife is killed.  And Mandy Patinkin is laughing.  What kind of interpretation is that?  It made my skin crawl.   The thing about Mr Patinkin is this:  He is a fantastic character actor with a phenomenal voice.  He just needs a director to reign him in.  For when left to his own devices, he relishes in his voice and forgets that someone has to listen to him, someone who maybe wore white that day and didn't want blood on their sleeve.  
 but 20 dollars more and hideous. I have a platinum Intuos2 tablet (a high school graduation present from 2004), and when I broke the pen, I ordered the regular intuos2 pen due to it's being slightly cheaper on Wacom's site. Here, the platinum is 20 dollars more (and in my opinion, much uglier). I recommend buying the classic intuos2 pen 
 Having an advanced degree in Sociology and also having personal relationships with members of Old Order Groups does not make me an unbiased reviewer of this work. As it stands, I believe it takes a very conservative and functional perspective on the dynamic groups of these people and does not even begin to address the integration of change and conflict within these groups in anything ut a very superficial way. A shame, as I was hoping for a more dynamic read than a functionalist perspective of very diverse and dynamic subgroups.  As it stands, I found the work not truly willing or able to explore deviance, social control, conflict or the realism of the daily lives of these peoples as they struggle with their religious lifestyle and the world around them. As stated, it was a descriptive work from a functionalist perspective. Too bad as the subject and persons are far more interesting than the authors would have left one to believe, especially when living among those people in communities and thier true impact on the larger secular society around them as I have seen 
 The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film 
    Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are acttually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 I bought this cd for one song "This Flight Tonight" and now i know why. The rest of it [isn't good]. If you want the two songs from Hair of the Dog buy that cd 
 Clay Walker is a good country singer, but his albums lack quality.  There are usually only 2-4 good songs on his albums, and those are the ones we hear on the radio.  Whoever is responsible for putting his albums together  mostly puts fillers in for the rest of the songs on the albums.  You will  only enjoy the album if you are a definite Clay Walker fan, otherwise buy  your favorite singles from him 
 Not enough explanation to carry over into real time test taking. 
 I'm sorry to report that this book merely presents an outline of steps to take, along with a collection of document templates, neither of which contain any actual "content".  In other words, it tells you "what", but not "how".  If you're looking for insight and real-world examples, look elsewhere.  I couldn't justify a bunch of blank forms and outlines for such a cover-price.  I sent mine back and Amazon graciously refunded my money 
 Anyone who has read Reilly's books in the past know he's not a terribly strong writer. However, in the past, he has made up for the poor literary skills with compelling stories. Not so this time. The writing is so bloody awful, even for Reilly, that I can't bear to read anymore. Like mentioned earlier, italics are over used, and he's gone way overboard on onomatopoeia.   Reilly's other books are readable, especially when you need a page turner to distract you from, say, a long plane-ride. This is not one of those books, simply because it's written so poorly. 
 Yeah and if you thought the review's title was ridiculous...  It's not so much that the book is confusing or that the characters could use a bit more depth, it's that from the get-go, the writing is cliche.  Pat Cadigan, who hit a home run with Mind Players, tries way too hard to be -- captial "C" -- Cyberpunk in this book.  It's possible that because I've only just read Synners while I read my first 'cyberpunk' book in the early 90s I've lost the ability to be impressed by attempts at 'hard edged' writing that tries to use slang like 'stone home' and 'hot-wire' to indicate a machine or drug centric society on the edge of destruction; but there's just so many sentences that seem oh so dutifully crafted to fit into what cyberpunk is Supposed To Be.    I give it two stars because underneath the cliche there are interesting ideas; it's just too bad one has to wade through so much over-eager writing to see them through.  If you really want to read an engaging book of speculative fiction by Pat Cadigan that bucks the cliches of cyberpunk and strikes out on its own read Mind Players 
 Jack London's efforts at social novels, such as "Iron Heel" and "Martin Eden" were failures, because they are very cardboard and unconvincing. Jack London, the master story teller of the juvenile boys adventure novels, had a social conscience, but was not very good with expressing the social issues of the day, issues which usually belong in manifestos, not in literature. Jack London was no Dostoievsky, a true literary giant 
 I gave the book 2-stars as I like very much the information contained, however, find that it difficult to put into practice. It seems that Ms. Kingston only recommends space clearing tool (bells, harmony balls, etc.) that comes from Bali because they are produced by the purest of priests and therefore produce the purest of sound. The bells, in particular, that Ms. Kingston recommends are not available to the general public and therefore she makes them available through her own website which is very convenient. Convenient, that it, until you learn that the most inexpensive bell listed on the site is $160, and even then comes with a note from Ms. Kingston that it will not produce the same results as the $250 dollar model.  I do find it odd that Ms. Kingston provides that much of space clearing is about the intention of the practitioner, but then contradicts herself with the viewpoint that only the best results can come from her one-of-a-kind tools  So, although I hate to be a spiritual skeptic, I find this book a bit of a spiritual tease. "Here is a great way to bring peace and love and wonder to your life ... and that will be $250 please". Because of the contradiction noted above, the book only warrants a 2 in my view.    
 I have seen several films about Van Gogh, all which were fascinating.  In each Van Gogh was a character that was portrayed in a manner that was human and who had ideas and humanity as well as a need to do art.  By contrast, Harris' Pollock lacked any humanity, except for one scene where he takes a dog to a vet.  And Pollock didn't seem to be someone who thought about life at all.  He hardly cared about anyone and in the whole movie connected with no one with the exception of his wife, and that was far more a practical relationship than a love relationship.  His wife Lee was portrayed as a generally uninteresting person as well.  I was not drawn in by the film at all by any of the main characters.  Pollock's gift to the world was his art; who he was and the life he lived were not worth making a movie of if this is the best the story can be told in film.  
 First let me say that this movie DOES, indeed, have subtitles.  Unfortunately, this is just one of those annoying DVDs where you actually have to turn them on with your remote.  I personally think that Asia Argento is sexy in a very skanky sort of way.  I shouldn't like her as much as I do, but I do anyway.  I think she's gorgeous and her pelvic tattoo is amazing.  I also think she usually has great taste in the projects she takes on in Europe, but her American films leave a lot to be desired.  Unfortunately, this is NOT one of her great European movies.  In fact, I think the other reviewers who refered to this movie as "pretentious" were being way too kind.    While I admire what Asia was wanting to do with this movie, it comes across as more of a  PRETENTIOUS ( I couldn't think of a better word) teenage-goth-girl-sex-fantasy.  It's a low budget DV feature done in a pseudo-Dogma 95 style.  Translated that means the script is very minimal and the production values aren't all that great.  Some would have you believe this is for "artistic" effect.  Personally, I think that's a bunch of crap.  The teenage-goth-girl-sex-fantasy aspect gets REALLY old after about 5 minutes.  The lack of an interesting plot doesn't even make the more superficial T&A aspects worth watching.  (AND I LOVE MY T&A!!!!!!!)    Besides the nudity, I think the only other aspect of this film I liked was the jab they took at director Gus Van Sant, refering to a fictional version of Cleopatra he would direct.  (I've heard the Italians don't like Gus or his movies.)    My personal recommendation is not to waste your time with this movie.  If you  must watch this film, borrow a copy from a friend.  If none of your friends own it, or you don't have any friends, rent a copy.  If you are so absolutely obsessed with seeing this movie, to the point you just have to buy a copy, get one from Amazon Marketplace.  Don't pay more than $5 or $6 for it, it's 90 minutes of your life you will never get back again. 
 If your not an Absolute Beginner...  If you have at least some background with programming...  This book probably is not for you.  I'm only through the first 9 chapters of this book and I'm having a hard time staying awake while reading it...  Perhaps if I was a true beginner I'd appreciate his methods, but to me it seems like the author was paid by the word.  Which is to say he uses three paragraphs to say one sentence of meaningful information. And he repeats himself several times (at least in the first three chapters of the book)  I wish the guys who wrote the PHP manual could do one for VBScript 
 Whatever felicity Edwards manages in this work, do not credit the ideas represented to Edwards himself.  All of his central points on freedom are no more than a Christian appropriation of secular English philosophy in Hobbes, somewhat in Locke, and certainly of David Hume.  In the old philosophy, choice is an illusion, because in any course of action we are determined necessarily by our nature; Edwards agrees fully, adding only that our nature gets some extra help from God when it comes to sanctification.      He advances the idea that in every snapshot of human life, we make decisions in accordance with our nature and disposition.  Free will is compatabilist in that we have no autonomy other than to follow our greatest desire in any given instance.  Not only does this exposition rule out the chance for true virtue--some good thing we do which we might not have done--but Edwards also has a hard time explaining how God is not the author of evil, given that human decisions are consistently determined according to a divine decree 
 Generally well written prose, Evan's "The American Century" is rife with examples of his left-leaning tendencies.  Throughout the book, every Democrat is described in noble and glowing terms.  Errors made by the liberals are explained away as casual mistakes or honest misunderstandings.  Democrats are universally portrayed as virtuous and well-meaning.  Conversely, all Republicans/conservatives are shown to be mean-spirited and their policies are donation driven and designed to hurt the "average" American.  I understand that every historian writes with a particular bias, but the totality of it here makes the work unreadable to less idealogically-driven readers 
 The story is entertaining enough, but there is not much joy from viewing this DVD. The problem is that the folks producing it apparently were trying to win the contest for the DVD having the world's squattest image. It is EXTREMELY letterboxed WITHIN a 16:9 widescreen format. Even your zoom function won't help you, because the producers moved the subtitles into the black-bar region (and the subtitles are about 2/3 the height of the image itself. The movie becomes simply uninvolving when you see low-resolution images on a thin ribbon across the screen 
 The quality of this product cannot in any way compare to the genuine Apple iPod covers.  It is very flimsy, does not fit correctly, does not come with a belt clip and most importantly leaves the display area wide open to scratches and breakage.  That's right; there is no plastic or glass protection for the display area.   There is a reason why this product does not cost as much as other iPod covers.  That's because it is of poor quality.  Also, when you calculate the cost of the cover, plus the cost of shipping it, you do not get a bargin.  As a matter of fact, if someone gave me this product for free, I would not accept it because, like I stated earlier, it provides no protection. 
 This appears to be the senior thesis of a struggling C or D student.  The writing is very poor and it appears that the writer decided what conclusions she would reach and then fit all the facts to reach that conclusion, and failed to consider other sides of the issue.  A very one-sided, polemic and unintellectual book 
 teenage vegans and vegetarians aren't stupid people. if i had read this befor i had gone vegan, i probably wouldn't have... there are so many other great books out there with better information. try anne marie colbin's "food and healing.&quot 
 I want to start off by saying I am a lifetime Beatles fan and have read 90% of everything written about them. I was always a great admirer of John Lennon and was never a fan of Yoko. I just finished reading this book and I just want to say how disappointed I am. This was promoted as Cynthia finally telling the whole story but there is absolutely nothing new here even for someone with only a passing interest in the Beatles story. Cynthia wastes page after page re-telling well-known stories without even adding the insight that her perspective might hold. The worse part though is the never-ending whining that just gets worse and worse as the book goes on. Poor Cynthia and poor Julian. If Cynthia is to be believed, John is responsible for everything that ever went wrong in either of their lives, including all her failed marriages. Oh, but she's not bitter! Right.  
 I really, really, wanted to enjoy this book. I'm a girl, I believe in magic, and equal rights, and her writing is beautiful. But I didn't leave a patriarichal religion to run to the same thing, only replacing a male God with the female Goddess. I want equality, and I really don't understand how a person can claim they're being oppressed, then decide to oppress their oppressors. I guess, if you believe her tale, that balance must be achieved by ignoring the God as the Goddess was ignored. Myself, I prefer the "Be the change you wish to see in the world (Ghandi)" approach. I want to see equality between men and women, not the subservience of one to another. I come from the South, where alot of the guys are take-charge, outdoorsy, macho types. I like that, and I think I'm secure enough in my own power that I won't be taken over by them. I don't feel it neccessary to reaffirm my power by taking someone else's, which I feel Starhawk does. If you can take the rampant feminism and reverse sexism, then this book does have some spiritual value 
 Cold Mountain is an unfortunate novel.  It is unfortunate it won the National Book award (why did it win?).  The novel has an unfortunate structure; Fraser simply strings along one incident after another, with little connecting thread.  The weight of flashbacks alone drags the novel to the ground (and it hardly gets off the ground in the first place!)  There are glaring anachronisms.  It is difficult to believe that some of the sentiments he puts in his characters mouths could have been uttered in 1864.  This is a forgivable sin, if the novel is well written, if it rises about the banal, if it offers something more than surface.  But this novel is all surfaces and all banality.  Its publication is indicative of some of the pathology of today's publishing world (this will be a BIG novel, this will become a BIGGER film, which will sell more of this BIG novel).  Too bad for us the novel does not justify the claims of its promoters.  Fraser's eight million dollar advance for his next work is probably a clarion signal of another BIG novel to come 
 Most of the information was in his other books.  I was looking for recipes not a rehash of his other factual writing.  The few receipes included were not very exciting 
 After making a strong case that Boxers need specialized training, there seems to be little in it  particular to the Boxer.  I wonder if this is just an edit off one of the other Barron's books.  Two, the author pushes treats as training rewards, which many believe isnt the best.  Three, on some topics, like handling aggression, the author just punts - 'consult an expert.'  Not very helpful.  All in all, I prefer the Monks of New Skeet, and "The Art of Raising a Puppy. 
 She seems to have been heavily influenced by both azuza street crowd i.e. much of today's pentecostalism/charasmatics i.e. the toronto/brownsville blessing (a history which is fraught with charlatans and very biblically problemic) and hollywood.   In studying many of her sermons what is readily apparent is the lack of any solid biblical understanding or doctrine. It was just get saved and jesus loves you. A cozy accomodation to the masses who can pretty much define that jesus they want to believe in and then follow.  
 The problem with America was that started out great.  The first album was fresh and different from everything.  Three young boys and accoustic quitars was a song all it own.  "Horse with no name" and "SandMan", was what pave the way for them.  The problem was that each album after that they got farther away from their roots and into the middle of mainstream pop. They should of left "Muskrat Love." to the Captain and Tennille.  This album does a fine job of showing their career from beginning to end.  The problem was that there was their first two albums, ( America and Venture Highway) and there was their others.  My recommandation would be to pick up the first 2 and leave this for the die hard fans 
 I'm disappointed by this record. Where are those haunting guitars of HEAD, GOAT and DOWN? The 2 first tracks really suck, and the first half of the album is pretty weak. Plus they tried something different with much more  melodies in the chorus of some of the songs of this album and on the 5 song  EP that came out shortly before. I think it's a bad idea for them. David  Yow just can't sing this type of song, plus it doesn't have the scary sound  of the Jesus Lizard, which make them so incredible. The second half of the  record is way better, but this album is easily their weakest effort. So be  sure to listen to it before buying it. In my opinion, it's not worth  having 
 THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THIS PUBLISHERS EDITION NOT ABOUT THE BOOKS CONTENT ITSELF.  If you want to know about the content--- be aware that this book is copyright free and in the public domain and you can actually read the entire text free, online, if you are curious about the content of the book and what it is about. I am a person who prefers a real, bound book in the hand to reading on the computer screen or printing off a book onto computer paper.  I learned about this book as it is popular with homeschoolers using the Charlotte Mason method.  This book weaves science content into a story format (narrative format).  About this edition of the book--buyer beware!  I am very annoyed. I saw that Amazon sells three different publishers' versions of reprints of this very old book, before I purchased the book from Amazon.  Of course I am mad at myself for making a mistake, but I am also not happy with the way Amazon markets this Kessinger Publishing's version of this book.  I have had issues in the past with facsimile reprints of antique books sometimes being very hard to read. I took time to research this. I wanted whichever publisher's version has a readable font that is clearly printed.  The way Amazon presently has this item (book reprinted by Kessinger Publishing) set up on their webpage, I thought I was looking inside this book. Imagine my surprise when the book arrived and the printing itself is horrible! I can't stand to read this! Upon double checking this now, I see I made a simple mistake--if you don't want to make the same mistake that I made please read on...  It appears that this Kessinger Publishing version is a facsimile reproduction of the original. The old font type is hard to read. But the more problematic thing is that the ink is blobby and uneven. Specifically, I mean that some parts of the letters are missing (there is white space) while others are blobbed so that the letters don't look as they should, they are black blobs in some parts. I would prefer a book whose text is clearly visible. A modern font is also usually easier on the eyes.  I am very annoyed as this is not even the cheapest price edition of this book which is currently in print! Come to find out there are cheaper versions with nicer and easier to read font!  I am upset with Amazon additionally as the way they have this set up to "look inside this book" brings you to the edition published by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" which has what looks to be a great font, a nice, clear, modern font and a good printing job. (Also today I received a different book purchased from Amazon by the publisher "Yesterday's Classics" and it is a wonderful printing job and a a nice binding to boot.  I will be returning this book to Amazon. Too bad I have to pay the shipping to return it to them! 
 The prose in this book is so convoluted and each point takes so long to develop that you'll be soon asleep.   What's worse, the book is neither a solid academic overview of the field nor is it a useful handbook for the practitioner.    Rossi and his co-authors make many attempts to give us the grand theoretical frameworks but they quickly get lost in qualifying themselves into a tepid soup in which nothing is ever black or white, hot or cold, true or false.     Although there are some capsule summaries and references to real programmes, these callouts are helpful only to break the tedium.  They are not presented in sufficient detail that normal people could ever learn from them.  There is never any clear instruction about how one should begin an evaluation or how one should proceed.    Possibly this book is useful for an intermediate-to-advanced evaluation practitioner who is interested in comparing his broad generalizations with Rossi's.   
 Over the years I've learned to beware of writers who earn their living inside the walls of academe. It's often a creative trap, and Ms. Moore is no exception. She shows all the shortcomings of a scribe who uses her students as bouncing boards for vignettes, none of which deal with people very far from university life and none of which are in any real sense true short stories. The "in" jokes among her often stereotypical characters may amuse freshmen writing majors, but the average reader looks in vain for any true authenticity (as, for example in the stories of Alice Munro or T.C. Boyle). The shame of it is that Ms. Moore can write--but in this collection she chooses to offer us nothing that holds any attention beyond a clever sentence 
 ...upon actual research it is clearly false. Many others have delved into the finer points of Menzies' poor methodology and often deliberate exaggeration or falsities, so I won't bother. I'll only list four points that I think stand out even without deep fact checking:  1)Niccolo di Conti, the venetian explorer and crucial link in the book who supposedly sailed with the Chinese treasure fleet in 1421, failed to mention in his memoirs anything about Chinese junks or going to the four corners of the world. This seems strange.  2)The Fleet sailed to virtually every coastline in the world but missed Europe entirely, the one place sure to mark their passing for posterity. This is neither evidence nor disproof, merely a sketchy coincidence.  3)Native Americans are given startlingly short shrift, both in the book and in many of the reviews. Virtually every time something sophisticated is presented in the ancient new world it is attributed to the Chinese, reminding me of the Easter Island "mystery" of who carved those giant heads. For the record, Native populations weren't childish savages; prior to European contact they had very sophisticated civilizations, fully capable of jewelery work, cloth garments, and carving statues.  4)Lastly, Given the vast numbers of Chinese sailors involved(roughly 25-30,000), the presence of domesticated animals such as horses and pigs, and the inevitable presence of huge numbers of stow-away rats, doesn't it strike anyone as odd that there were apparently no diseases passed on to the various native populations in the Americas? It only took a very small amount of European contact to spark the largest, and deadliest pandemic in history that raged for nearly two centuries killing unknown millions of Native Americans. Chinese contact of the scale claimed would certainly have had a similar, if not worse, effect.  Ultimately Menzies' book is entertaining, leaving the reader hoping it is true merely for the fantastic nature of the thesis. In the end, however, the evidence and analysis simply are not there.  
 I had this toy for 1 day and it leaked, so I returned it.  My daughter really didn't seem all that interested in it anyway.  She seemed the most interested in the water part, and you can buy much cheaper water filled mat toys.  It's really not worth the money, and it does tend to leak 
 Taylor Dane has topped the US pop, dance and adult contemporary charts.   But the real test for blue-eyed soul is the US R&B chart. A single song that peaked at number 21?  She is just another blonde babe with a decent if indistinguishable voice (but she sure does look good in those videos, doesn't she?).  For the real goods, check out Lisa Stansfield or Teena Marie 
 While there are a few good tips, I found the book lacking in enough detail to actually use (especially in the makeup section).  Some of the tips on natural solutions for menopause were actually counter to scientific evidence.  Complete waste of my money.  I find myself at a loss for what to do with the book - I don't want to pass it along to anyone else . .  
 Rhea Perlman, a short white woman, is going to teach basketball to her towering Black high school students. And even though she knows nothing about hasketball she can still turn them into winners because she's White and sensitive and wants to be their "sistah." Gag me. This whole movie is completely insulting to people of all races. The director seems so sure he can sell a hip-hop basketball movie this bad to "those people" that he doesn't even bother to hide his apparent distaste for them. Avoid at all costs 
 I was so excited for my Groovaloos DVD to come, but I was very disappointed. The dancers take 5x more effort showing off then actually teaching steps. There is no step breakdown, no counting, no different views. They basically do the dance 1 time at a medium pace and expect you to just catch on from there. I watched it twice and decided to throw it in the junk box 
 This book was by far the WORST book I have ever read on techniques in orchestration.  The author is completely obsessed with his own works and his examples are meaningless and weak 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 Not what was expected at all. Not a new approach to this subject,was very boring---much remenber this and remenber that stuff--did not like this book--intend to give it to goodwill 
 If you're expecting the same power and intensity of "Scooby Doo On Zombie Island" or "Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost," then you are setting yourself up for a disappointment. It is possible that certain powers felt that the first 2 Scooby movies were too much for children, but with this 3rd movie come a loss of impact, suspense, character development, and even mystery. It may be true that even a medocre Scooby movie is better than no Scooby movie at all, but this movie is almost boring after "Zombie Island" or "Witch's Ghost." Well, Scooby and the gang have car trouble in a desert. Fred, Daphne, and Velmah go on foot for help while Scooby and Shaggy spot what may be an alien invasion. With their famous and hilarious cowardly ways, they run and eventually meet the rest of the gang at a restaurant. At the restaurant, the gang is surprised that the other patrons don't seem so surprised about the presence of aliens. We also meet Lester who appears eccentric but still aware of what has been going on in the area. Lester lets the gang stay the night, and Scooby and Shaggy have their first encounter with the possible 'aliens.' Moving on, Scooby and Shaggy meet Amber and Crystal, and are attracted to them. They later meet the mechanic Buck as well as a team of scientists (that we already have met). Unlike "Zombie Island" and "Witch's Ghost," the misleads are not really well drawn. Also, rather than being surprised by the discovery of the villains, we are likely to be somewhat disappointed that it was so obvious. Even when we are presented with the most unusual character in this story (in this case it seems pointless to try to hide anything) it's nothing most people couldn't have figured out. I won't deny that there are some good moments in this movie. (For undoubtedly the first time, Scooby and Shaggy go to a restaurant and want nothing!)  But even the old episodes were usually better than this movie. Parents may not have to screen this movie, but it is  likely that even children will fall asleep during this one. Thank goodness for the eventual "Legend of the Vampire" and "Aloha Scooby Doo." 
 I have been a huge fan of Dean Koontz for years, ever since my mom got me to read Watchers.  But this story is just way too slow.  Just when I thought it was going to grab my attention and start off for the rollar coaster ride....it would slow way down again.  I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner.  About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I wouldn't recommend this book to any first time Dean Koontz reader because it would most likely turn you off....don't judge his work by this novel.  
 My last review was removed by amazon despite the fact that it contained no bad language nor objectionable phrases.   So here goes:  It is amateurish and you would have to be a huge G. Butler fan to like it.  So if you are, then this is the book for you!  I just wanted a nice Phantom story where he redeems himself.  This book didn't really measure up to that, although the ending was unusual and is what earns this book the one star that I give it 
 Am I the *ONLY* person who thinks Thoreau was an arrogant snob who did nothing but whine? Maybe it's because I'm an Englishman in America but all I hear is American educational institutions praising Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience". I don't deny that he has made some points worth considering in his book but many people have made the same points without whining and railing at humanity.  I would dearly like to say I had the patience to read this book all the way through but it is perhaps the only book I've ever read that I couldn't finish. I found it hard to separate Thoreau's genuine, honest observations from his juvenile complaining.   The phrase that most ran through my head (shortly before I deleted the book) was "o'erweening arrogance". The man's arrogance is astounding. He supposes himself so far superior to his peers in EVERY way.  I found his writing to be confused and self-serving. He could barely hold a topic for one page at a time before veering off on to another, entirely unrelated one. He skips from subject to subject and often contradicts himself within the same chapter.  I got the electronic version of this book and, to date, it is the only book I have actually deleted. So, I'd love to pepper my "critique" with quotes that I found completely offensive and juvenile but that would mean getting the book again and I *really* don't want to do that 
 I think that this is the worse written book out of her whole series.  It repeats itself soooo many times that you can skip paragraphs without missing anything. The writing style is not consistant with her other books in the series and almost seems that a different person wrote each paragraph. One of many inconsistancies that I found in this book was the conversion from human to Carpathian.  In all the other books it states that it take 3 blood transfers to convert - in this one it states 4.  And I just wanted to yell at Alex and tell her to get over it already - the vampire had almost converted her completely anyway. And also during the conversion it states that Alex threw up the tainted vampire blood, yet she had just taken blood from Aiden and they are supposed to be able to push the toxins out of their pores - not throw it up after a day has passed since the first vampire exchange.  I've read 9 of the books, but not in order and couldn't wait to read Aiden's story, but I am VERY dissapointed in this one.  It was so poorly written that I would have given it 0 stars if it was possible.  If you like strong females - I suggest reading Dark Destiny.    
 Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.  What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.    Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great 
 This is a bit of a muddle.  Not professionally written or reported--there is no hypothesis, no facts, no linear thinking that takes the viewer through the evidence to arrive at a conclusion.  Don't waste your time or money on this one 
 This CD shocked me. At first I was listening and enjoying the beats on every track. But then listening to the actual content of each song, B*tch this and h*e that. Come on, as a young female, how am I supposed to bump this in my car? Every single song on the CD is disrespectful. You know what really makes me mad, this is what's supposed to be hot, popular. What kind of message is this sending to our young black men? Our young women? I would not recommend this for any one, especially anyone under the age of 16 or any woman. 
 I recieved this calendar as a Christmas gift after raving about the book.  When I opened it at work I was very disappointed to discover that the the quality of the calendar was so poor.  I expected it to be in color!  The book was in color, the box was in color and nowhere did it let you know that it was in black and white.  Also the pictures are washed out and the paper is of a poor quality.  This was not worth the money my husband spent on it and I'm sorry to say that I'll have to buy a calendar because I can't stand looking at this one 
 This novel is totally "stream of consciousness."  It jumps around through past and present.  It's impossible to follow any kind of coherent plot.  I had enjoyed the movie "LA Confidential" and thought I wanted to read Ellroy.  I was mistaken! 
 Overall, I wouldn't recommend the Insider's Guide to the Colleges to either parents or students.  I feel that Fiske, Princeton Review and Kaplan (even though the last edition is becoming dated) are better sources of information.    However, there are some good aspects to the Insider's Guide so I would at least recommend picking up the book at the library and skimming the beginning section on choosing a college.  Insider's does a good job of mentioning all the facets a student should consider and they do a very fair job of detailing the strengths and weaknesses of both small and large schools.  On the other hand, I have to agree with the reviewer who said that the entries make each school sound like either a "party school" or a "nerd school" as if colleges only came in two varieties.  I think it quickly becomes very hard to distinguish individual qualities of the schools because so much emphasis is placed on the balance of partying to studying to the exclusion of other information, particularly about good academic reasons to attend a school.  It's also apparent that Insider's is placing a little too much emphasis on sports when they discuss a school's croquet or handball program.  Yep, that makes the school different, but it should be obvious to Insider's that there are other aspects of the school they should have focused on instead.   Now my writing is not the best, but I suppose I expected better from Yale students.  One writer used the non-existent word "irregardless" (it's "regardless") while another couldn't be bothered to check if Stony Brook was one word or two.  The writers sometimes delivered badly executed last paragraphs with incongruous sentences, poor transitions and confusing conclusions.  You end up with something like "Students at X University say that the food is horrific, the dorms should be condemned and the school is less exciting than a cemetery.  It's a great place to spend four years."  Yes, I suppose it would be fair to give them a break since they're only undergraduates (I think), but I feel it's important to expose our high school kids to the superior writing found in other guides like Fiske or Princeton Review instead of something that's not very good.    This brings me to the Insider's Guide's assertion that the book is "funny and incredibly entertaining."  While this is subjective, I strongly disagree.  The Insider's Guide is fairly boring compared to the much wittier Princeton Review guide.  Personally, my favorite is Fiske, but I would say that if a parent is having trouble getting her teenager to start looking at colleges seriously, she'd pick up something besides Fiske, and I suspect it's often the Insider's Guide as it's written by "students for students."  However, not only is Princeton Review better written, the format of the Insider's Guide is user-surly with small print and cramped, unattractive pages.  I will say that the Insider's Guide does a better job of sticking to factual statistics than giving schools subjective ratings on a four-star scale, and some may prefer that.  As a matter of fact, the Insider's Guide does have a few statistics that Princeton Review neglects and two of them are important:  The freshman retention rate and the graduation rate.  Both statistics are fairly good indicators of how happy students are at their respective schools.  So if those stats are important to you, that might be one reason to at least browse through the Insider's Guide.    The Insider's Guide inexplicably leaves out some top-notch schools, particularly in Texas and Louisiana (such as Loyola) while including some rather absurd choices that have SAT means in the low 400's or in one case, 300's.  They also have a number of large state schools that I don't feel have any place in a guide to the "top schools."  The fact is that they attract a multitude of applicants which means more people will buy this book.   I wouldn't suggest removing the schools with very unimpressive statistics if there are sufficient reasons to keep them (in many cases, I couldn't find any), but with some  incomprehensible exclusions, I can't say I find the book authoritative or comprehensive.  Go with Fiske or, if your student isn't excited about researching colleges, go with Princeton Review.     
  I purchased this Vantec product and used it for a short time.  Most USB enclosures offer "heat dissipation thru the metal case", as does this one. However, I grew very concerned about how hot the Vantec became, especially after active operation.   Heat is a major enemy of electrical motors. The HDD obviously just cooks inside the Vantec. There is also a definitive  difference between its temperature in stand-by mode, and during/immediately after active use.   I found another USB enclosure offering active ventilation: the Apricorn EZ Bus DT, which not only has a built-in fan, but IMHO, for several critical reasons, is a better design and a smarter choice.  Here is why:   The Apricorn's 3-inch diameter fan is mounted transversely, so it pulls heat directly off the entire underside of the HDD and expels thru vents on either end of the case.   In comparison, the Vantec's internal chassis has a solid metal plate which covers the entire HDD circuit board (see the image I loaded above).  The Vantec has no venting, so the heat inside builds up fast. I installed a 500GB HDD in the Apricorn and ran a 220+GB backup from the Vantec. Upon completion hours later, the Apricorn's exterior was completely cool to the touch; the Vantec's exterior was REALLY HOT.  A couple of other things I found superior about the Apricorn:   It's heavier with a wider base, compared to the Vantec's (3" vs. 1.5"). When mounted vertically, you can nudge the Vantec (or the desk it's sitting on) and it will fall over; it happened twice in the few days I used it. There would be major motion required to tip the Apricorn, and I've never toppled it in months of use.   The Apricorn's easy-action pushbutton power switch is conveniently (and sensibly) located on the front of the unit. The Vantec's is on the bottom of the rear panel (see photo above), but it's a stiff toggle-type switch and awkward to operate. You have to hold the Vantec down with one hand firmly in order to get enough leverage to operate the balky switch... and you leave a nice handprint on the case, which then has to be cleaned. Do that a few times and the sexy "mirror finish" isn't going to look new for very long.   Also, the Vantec's internal PC board HDD cable is mounted off-center on from the socket on any HDD. You have to kink the Vantec's flat cable in order to complete the connection (see photo above). The Apricorn's is located exactly in line with the HDD's connector, and requires no stressing of the cable.   The Apricorn is available here on Amazon, but I found it for less at Page Computers. It is slightly higher in cost than the Vantec, but I'm convinced it is a much better product. Also, with Apricorn's active ventilation and greater physical stability, I have peace of mind about the longevity & safety of the expensive drive mounted inside it 
 Every so often, Thomas Bezucha`s "The Family Stone"  injects itself with a dose of reality about the modern liberal family - that intellectual, caustic, "progressive," argumentative, often matriarchal nuclear unit with imperfections not unlike the conservative "family values" crew. Selfishness. Materialism. Pettiness. Depression. Noise. Veiled cruelty toward the black sheep of the group, which, in this case, is the one most interested in pleasing his parents.   But this movie is not really sincere about the realities of such a family - it's serious about it, all right, but not sincere. It is a Christmas family mosaic where everybody gathers round the twelve-seat dining table of a nine-bedroom house for a seven-course meal to assume their roles and pick on The Prodigal Son's new girlfriend. It is also a button-pushing, shameless picture that insists we like that shrill, pushy Diane Keaton persona more or less because her character is dying of cancer. Keaton plays one of those "full of it" moms - falsely hip, falsely sage,  constantly yelling and hugging and pitching fits and hogging the stage - so accustomed  is she to this domestic tyranny that when the girlfriend calls her on it, we get a scene I couldn`t quite believe.   Back to that in a minute. "The Family Stone" assembles a large cast for its tale: Keaton is Sybil; Craig T. Nelson is husband Kelly; Dermot Mulroney is the parent-pleaser Everett, Luke Wilson is the laid-back  Ben; Ty Giordano is the gay, deaf Thad. And Rachel McAdams slums (just a little) as mommy's academic daughter Amy, who sincerely (yet inexplicably) dislikes Everett's  straight-laced fiancée Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) as much she will eventually like Meredith's sister Julie (Claire Danes), who arrives midway through and enraptures Everett, who`s 16 years older.   "She does this thing with her throat," Amy says of Meredith's phlegm-clearing tic. Meredith cannot  relax, and the Stones' idea of hospitality is to let their guest know how hospitable they could be - if only she would make herself at home. Sybil and Amy take their snarky turns on Meredith. Sybil stares wistfully out the window awaiting the mid-movie revelation that she's dying. Mulroney puts on his Mulroney Face - think Stallone in mild anguish - while Everett wrestles with it all. Kelly and Ben eat marijuana brownies at the high school football field. Ben looks at Meredith as if he'd like to see if she loosens up drunk. Three potato chips if you've guessed she loosens up drunk.  It leads to and falls away from that moment at the dinner table when Ty's homosexuality is thrown around for some tired, liberal humor. Ty and his boyfriend (Brian White) intend to adopt children, and Meredith asks a sincere question of nature vs. nurture, which Sybil bombastically turns into a mini-skit on how she wished all her sons had been gay, a plenty-ignorant thing to say, deliberately said for effect, which Meredith misses. Thus Meredith's second question: "Do you really mean that?"  What Bezucha writes next is fascinating, if brutal and unfair. The entire family dives into Meredith - it climaxes with Sybil literally cursing the girl to hell - while Ty, a saint by now, mists at the notion that maybe he, a deaf, gay man, has had a life he may not have wished on his brothers. Meredith is a stiff and suit, sure, but that "The Family Stone"  actually brings her back into the fold after such a humiliation speaks of its intention to preach and convert.   Of what? Hard to say. That gays should adopt children? That blowhards are better than the sincere because they`re dying and judgmental in the right ways? That all can be forgiven with, fittingly, an old photograph of the mother in her ninth month of pregnancy? That we should worship at the altar of human imperfection? That the movie is really a veiled tribute to the mother Bezucha either had or wished for? If so, well, I did not have. And I do not wish 
 I'm a sucker for these "social satire" type novels, especially when they skewer the rich pretentious people in New York City for whom only the Ivys are good enough and who start with the fierce competition in preschool.  This book sounded like it would deliver that, but unfortunately, it bored me.  I was never really clear on why Laura wanted to be involved in this mess in the first place.  She is presented as having good, solid values, but she gets caught up in the competition madness anyway.  Which she admits, but then her claims to be somehow "better" or have "more common sense" than the other characters do not stand up to scrutiny.  But then there was the book itself...boring.  A major mystery revolves around who kills a hamster.  Could there be a sociopath-in-the-making, some "evil" young child who is a hamster-murderer?  Which children attend therapy?  Could a child have some awful disorder that would make him or her do this?  Obviously, since the hamster-killer will be rejected from the exclusive school, it is imperative to find out just who wrung the hamster's neck, and as soon as possible.  Competitive parents are trying to lock other children out of the prestigious school by falsely accusing other children of hamster-murder.  I mean, come on.  Could this happen?  I suppose so.  Is it funny or satirical?  No.  It's not portrayed well enough to be funny, and it's much too l-o-n-g and drawn out to be good satire.  I got really tired of hearing about the darned hamster.  Maybe the point is that these parents will freak out about everything, but unfortunately, the reader gets dragged through a bunch of "is it him?  is it her?  will my child be falsely accused?" hamster-murder BS until I was thoroughly sick of the whole thing.  It seems to me that good satire is not boring, but boy, is this preoccupation boring.  When we finally find out who killed the hamster and why, I was completely underwhelmed.  I didn't care about anyone at that point.  Of course there are the requisite "secrets" about the upper-crust parents, but I'm afraid they bored me as well.  I'm learning the hard way that just because a novel is described as satire, and the situation sounds very interesting, that does NOT make it good reading.  I'm having a similar struggle getting through Claire Messud's latest, but I will try it again.    Satire should be interesting, and the fact that so many authors fall back on the Candide device (wide-eyed innocent observing a bunch of weirdos) is getting extremely tiresome.  Especially when Candide compromises her principles to be part of the popular crowd and then has an unrealistic "revelation" at the end.  Please, give me Edith Wharton any day over this 
 I didn't enjoy the film.  I also didn't enjoy the original play by Shakespeare.  King Lear is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays.  I don't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add nothing of value to the original.  You can set it wherever you like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up three hours of your time.  A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son.  The youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father.  He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated shabbily.  He's wanted dead or dead.  In this treatment of the annoying plot, he loses his mind.  He has a faithful follower or two.  They overact.  There is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play.  Lear Hidetoro is an absolute jerk.  Am I supposed to care what happens to him?  Why?  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one?  You may as well cry over Saddam Hussein.  Look at this movie with fresh eyes.  Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes.  This stuff simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good.  The hell with King Lear.  He's an annoyance 
 I cannot comment on the Fire Marshall who lost his life because I do not possess any knowledge regarding who he was, what he had done, or what he may have tried to do and I thank him for his courage and sacrifice.  However, I suggest Mr. Lance conduct more research on Nancy Floyd's background and her FBI service before writing or relaying anything she says as gospel.  The book reads like a thriller and I would give it four stars as a thriller. But because the author loses credibilty in his portrayal of Nancy Floyd, I give it an overall one star 
    Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are acttually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 The importance of Derrida and his movement is monumental - not for the term "deconstructionism" (heard frequently without a clue to its true meaning) but for how he has influenced (Western) society. Derrida, like Marcuse, Chomsky, Foucault and others, has moved from his original study to a broader agenda and, like many intellectuals, considers his mastery of one subject transferrable to another.  He managed to survive the embarrassing Paul de Man fiasco and has since wisely avoided mention of the "Hitler in all of us".  He has remarked on the authoritarian anti-democratic nature of deconstructionism, treating the subject ironically.   This is, allegedly, a textbook of post-Modern thought on language but reads like a didactic, out-of-focus Proust. The writing is  nebulous, self-referential, unreadable. He speaks in Orwellian terms equating opposite qualities and words. It is so ephemeral as to lack certitude and for this very reason many commentators fear definitive statements on the subject. Deconstructionism is, despite all the twaddle, inherently subjective. He muses on expression, anxiety, emotions, signs and existentialism, finding meaning and interpretation where there is none. His popularity rests entirely on academia and like-minded camp followers in the media. I mean, how many Iowans care about the "ultimate" meaning of allusions? The problem with the ouevre is that  when taken seriously, it literally make mountains of molehills.  Such as, well, equating fairy tales to S&M sagas, symphonies to invitations to rape, skyscrapers to phallic power trips, signs of "white" recycled paper as racism and stuttering as aggression. Allusions are, in Derrida-speak, fraught with deep meaning. To accomplish this one must divorce words from their sources and stated intent. The critic has been necessarily elevated above the  author since only he can provide a "true"  meaning. It is so outrageous that few outside of the Ivory Towers give it credence. That would be a mistake. Language is perhaps the most human of all abilities and its interpretation affects our personal and collective consciousness. His method has been called the "language of cultural Marxism" and is a necessary component of modern leftist ideology.  At any time I expect Jacques Derrida to announce, like Alan Sokal, that it has all been a collosal joke on both the true believer and the reader 
 ROBOT MONSTER is one of "those" classic Five Star One Star '50s horror movies. The problem with "C" movies is that they can't be rated by the usual standards. By its own standards its a gem.   But for the fact that this gobbler wasn't touched by Ed Wood it has all the guaranteed elements of bad moviemaking. Actually, ROBOT MONSTER was panned so severely upon release that director Phil Tucker attempted suicide afterward.  ROBOT MONSTER concerns the depredations of a fat gorilla-suited space alien in a diving helmet (Ro-Man from the planet Ro-Man which is populated by the race of Ro-Mans) who comes to earth and destroys virtually all of human life with the aid of a vacuum tube radio and a Lawrence Welk bubble machine.  Ro-Man is a grouchy, slow moving space visitor who talks with his hands and grumbles a lot. He lives in one of the more familiar Hollywood caves of Bronson Canyon, California.   The few surviving humans (a family of five) protect themselves by stringing aluminum foil around their house so that Ro-Man cannot use his death ray machine against them. Instead, he must dispose of them one at a time "by the process of strang-u-laaa-tion" if they are so foolish as to step outside of their Reynolds Wrap safety zone.    Given their current world political situation, the humans, Richard Nixon-like, are seeking "Peace---But peace with honor!" from Ro-Man. Hmmm. Seems reasonable. After all, Ro-Man has really shown restraint up until this point. Why shouldn't they trust him?    But wait! Even after atomizing everybody else (apparently including the film's scriptwriter) Ro-Man has developed a penchant for Alice, the eldest daughter of the survivors. Fortunately for us, Alice seems to have a corresponding yen for excessively hirsute and overweight men wearing fishbowls on their heads. So while Ro-Man is distracted picking a bouquet for his new girlfriend, the family figures out a way to finally finish him off.    Exactly how humanity is going to repopulate the earth with only the Father Knows Best kids around escapes me, but clearly someone involved with this film escaped from somewhere.  It's as bad and as much fun as it sounds.   
 The Third edition has been out since 2004 so there isn't any need to still purchase the second edition unless you can get it cheaper 
 The back cover of my copy of Stranger In A Strange Land has a quote on it from the Washington Post.  It says that it's "the best of (Robert Heinlein's) many books".  Well, if this is the best Mr. Heinlein can do, then I won't bother reading any more of his books.  Stranger In A Strange Land is one of the most disappointing "classics" I've ever read.  If you think you'd like a book where the Muslim character is nicknamed Stinky, the women are called "wenches", and one of the female characters says the following, "Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault", then this is the book for you.  I could probably overlook these missteps if only the rest of the book wasn't such hippy-dippy pseudo-intellectual garbage.  Stranger In A Strange Land may have been a classic in the Sixties.  Now it's little more than an embarrassment.       
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 Must have been all the hoopla or maybe I thought it would be comparable to the groundbreaking "When Ads Work", but this book is basically a 20-page pamphlet masquerading as a book. It keeps repeating a few truism and cliches over and over and over... and did I say over?   In contrast to "When Ads Work" which shared the results of the research, this book gives very few useful pointers and shares almost none of the research.  In contrast to "The Marketing Revolution", it also doesn't offer any groundbreaking methodologies.  I was glad it was not the only book I took on my flight from Miami to Los Angeles, it really wasn't meaty enough to fill even half the flight.  Rex Briggs ought to have offered a money-back warranty. I would certainly take it!  Marcelo Salu 
 Not that great. A far better read is "Sun, Sin And Suburbia: An Essential History Of Modern Las Vegas" by Geoff Schumacher.  
 "The Biggest Game in Town" is a book exploring the lead up to, the characters behind, and the culmination of, the 1981 World Series Of Poker. My main criticism of the book has little to do with the text itself. With poker becoming more mainstream, it was inevitable that the stakes would become higher, the stories would become crazier and this title and others like it would be left behind. As an example, the main prize in this book is several hundred thousand dollars. Compare this to the million dollar prize pools that are now being generated on an almost weekly basis and the reader can be forgiven for being dismissive about a first prize of "only" $375,000. The book recounts tales of businessmen being "stuck" for $50,000 but again compare that to the recent colossal struggle between Andy Beal and the Vegas professionals, where Beal initially gained the upper hand but eventually lost $10 million. Perhaps the one reason I would recommend the book is for its fleeting glance into the life of Stu Ungar, perhaps one of the greatest players to ever grace the felt. However, other than that I would say that there are many other poker titles I would recommend reading first, for example Nolan Dalla's "One of a Kind", a book that I suspect will stand the test of time 
 I read this book and tried the diet for three weeks. Although I didn't feel hungry and thought the shakes were okay, I found myself suffering from headaches and just not feeling very well in general. If you're looking for a crash diet, this might work, but I don't think it is a very healthy overall eating strategy for the long term. It does, however, force you to get more than enough fruits in your diet, which I enjoyed. Another thing: you need a good blender and enough time to clean it out a couple of times a day. Sounds silly, but it was expensive and time consuming for me 
 The bean is small, battery efficient, and has a nice overall look to it. Thats probably the only few good things that can be said about this product. This is NOT an mp3 player, it is a TRAC player. You have to convert all your mp3's into TRAC format before the player is able to play them. You also have to install their software which for most of us is an intrusive program trying to list every music file on your HD....this can ussually result in other people knowing what music you own especially if the software regularly communicates online. Another horror youll deal with is the slow transfer speed this device has. Just to load a single 3 meg file took an avg of 35 seconds, imagine how long 60 5 meg files would take. If your looking for an mp3 player that lets you just drag and drop your fav mp3s into the device so you can hear them hassel free this in not the player for you. This device is the Stalin of mp3 player requiring strict uncomfortable conformity play your fav songs 
 Unfortunately, this book could have been much better, because it has authenticity: it was written by the man who killed The Kid. But Garretts style of writing is horrible; it is an irregular narrative, without any  talent. Sometimes it looks like a diary, sometimes it looks like written in  a rush. I has absolutely no emotion about himself or the Kid and practicaly  no in-depth research. It added most of the legends now surrounding the Kid 
 Disappointing.  Looks like she was trying to wrap up the trilogy without putting too much effort into it.  It lacked much of the depth and richness of her previous books 
 This product did a terrible job of grinding and produced very inconsistant pepper grinds.  In addition, it was very hard to keep peppricorns fed into the grinder without going forwards and backwards with the crank.  
 I was thinking this book was written from a Christian perspective.  WOW, was I wrong.  If your desire is to raise a WORLDLY, EGOTISTICAL, SELFISH and IMMORAL daughter then this is the book for you. I gave this book 1 star because zero and below was not an option 
 This is another wooden, easily solved Krentz book.  What has happened to the author who wrote such classics as Absolutely, Positively or Trust Me?  These last few years have been nothing but one formulaic, clunky novel after another, with tiresome characters and easily-predicted plotlines.  I want the excitement and energy of her ealier novels, not some rehashed pulp with her name attached to boost sales.  I hate to say it, but I think I'm about ready to stop reading Krentz and look elsewhere for my romance jollies.  Don't waste your time with this book--go back and read some of her stuff from the nineties & see what a really well-written, exciting, and romantic novel can be like when it's done as well as Ms. Krentz can do 
 To start off with, I want to say that I really loved Ilium, and had very high hopes for Olympos. But I was ultimately dissapointed. There are a number of flaws I found in the book, most of which I'll mention here.  Like another reviewer, I was hoping the focus of Olympos would be the war between the united Greeks and Trojans against the gods. To avoid spoilers I won't say much other than there is very little time given to this conflict, which I found very dissapointing.  As many other reviewers have mentioned, the book seems to build for a long time, to what the reader hopes will be some sort of epic intense conclusion, but ultimately there is barely a climax at all. Also, not all mysteries set up by the book are explained (though overall a great deal will become more clear, there are a number of unexplained bits that annoy me). Along with unexplained mysteries, there are a few points in which the motivations of characters do not make much sense.  Also, one specific conflict we are essentially promised at the end of Ilium, and is foreshadowed a number of times in Olympos, never actually occurs. The reader is supposed to accept that this sort of showdown will probably happen at some point after the events of the book.   Olympos also lacks the intensity and action of Ilium. I remember reading the last 300 pages of Ilium in one sitting because  I was so enthralled. Olympos never reaches this level. In fact, by the end I was already dissapointed enough that I practically had to force myself to finish it.  One final thing that bothered me were a number of anti-Islam and homophobic bits that really add nothing to the story. They were essentially purposeless, yet they were there. At one point near the end homosexuality is described as if it was just some psychological disease existing only in the 21st century. This passage comes from nowhere, and like I said, serves no purpose.   While I still think Ilium was an amazing book, this sequal did not come close to meeting its promise 
 This book is trash written by a man with no faculty for research and no clear understanding of the subject. First define eccentric people as unconventional  types who are healthy, happy and functional (unhappy, nonfunctional types are after all neurotic- not eccentric).  Then make the astounding discovery that eccentrics are happier,healthier and more functional than the average.  If this sounds like science to you then you might enjoy the book.    The author fails to distinguish between eccentrics who  don't care about conformity , and those unfortunates who are grossly deluded or constitutionally incapable of conformity.  The author fails to recognise cold-blooded social sarcasm as oppposed to eccentricity.    As an experienced eccentric I  found the book  poorly thought out, self contradictory, and somewhat patronizing 
 I waited 15 years for this?  The ladies need to seriously hang it up before they accidentally wake up their sleeping kids.    Once you get married and have kids, dont ever pick up the guitar or drums and hit the record button. EVER.   And please spare the general public your very owned penned lullabyes.    This cd should be a prime example of these cringe worthy phenomenons.    If you want to listen to a good Bangles album, pick up All Over The Place and call it a day.  However the musicians who recorded All Over The Place no longer exist.  They have been replaced with baby ga-ga mommies, less Michael Steele (who should never have agreed to join this broken down band wagon).    Michael, there is still hope for you... run, run and dont look back!  You could be up there with the likes of Bonnie Rait, Sarah Mclachlan or Sheryl Crow!  Besides the fact that The Bangles failed to make a hit record after all this time, they proved that they couldnt even pull the songs off on live television.  They are supposed to be pro's, right? One would think so after 20 years in the music biz, but they just hide behind their "garage rock" label.    What they pulled off with Hazy Shade of Winter in 1987 will never ever be reproduced.  This time around, they had all the same control over the recording process and what we got was horrid.     The included DVD was hardly worth the effort of the physical act of placing the DVD in my DVD player.  Completely forgettable and trivial.     This album was many years in the making and many more years trying to find a label to actually market it. I wonder why. Perhaps the perspective labels actually heard the album demos.   If the ladies choose to put out another new cd with this same crappy formula, I suggest they change their name, because they are no longer the Bangles that I remember.    Such potential... such potential..... wasted.  At least stick with decent covers.  Good covers would have been better than this!    They still kick ass in concert.  Too bad, the album didnt contain any of their live energy.   
 Why is it that Us Weekly can't get a copy to me weekly?  Sometimes three weeks will go by without an issue.  Then I'll receive three in one week.  Us Weekly assures me that everything is normal and that they ship them just as soon they come off the printing presses.  I'm not buying their story or the magazine again 
 You know how it grates when you're exposed to a really really loud car stereo?   That's what this book is visually.  I am not interested in using a cookbook that 1) hurts my eyes and 2) isn't very original.  I mean, don't kids get enough stimulation nowadays without printing a cookbook this garish?    If you're looking to get the kids into the kitchen, save your money for The Everything Kid's Cookbook or Mommy and Me, both fantastic books for that purpose; or for ultra kid-friendly new recipes, Beyond Mac'n'Cheese (by MOPS), or if you're really serious about family cooking, The Cook's Illustrated Family Cookbook, all excellent selections.    For healthy alternatives, get the BH & G's Kid's Favorites Made Healthy--a really excellent book with lots of recipes that are charming and easy to make. Skip this tome, which aside from scarring your retina, is mundane at best 
 I'm a Die hard Dolph Lundgren Fan, but this movie made no sense, had one action scene, and was down right poorly acted by just about every character.  Now I have watched almost every movie dolf has been in, most are ok but you have to be a fan to really like.  Then there are some like men of war, Army of one (Joshua Tree), and Masters of the Universe that are just great movies.  But this movie does not fit into any of these catigories.  It is the worst dolph movie I have seen, and I have seen Agent Red 
  It was Mark Twain who popularized the aphorism of Benjamin Disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.  I kept hearing all these marvelous things about FREAKONOMICS, a book by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner, so when I ran across it at 25% off, I did a stupid freakin' thing and bought it.  I thought, What the freak, I've got a pretty inquisitive mind and I'm open to seeing things differently, to discovering new viewpoints.  The doubt started early when I got the book home and I first noticed the glowing comments on the dust jacket from the likes of Time, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Los Angeles Times.  When all of the liberal news agencies are lining up to tell me how wondrous a certain publication is, I'm immediately going to be freakin' suspicious.  Author Malcolm Gladwell tells us on the cover, "Prepare to be dazzled."  Well, evidently Ol' Malcolm is dazzled a whole lot easier than I am.  (I won't even mention the smug mug of Stephen Dubner that taunted me from the book's dust jacket because I don't want you to get the idea that I judge a book by its cover.  Or in this case, a writer by his physiognomy.  So I won't mention that.)  If you're the kind of person who is amazed to learn that 70% of auto accidents occur within 10 miles of a driver's home, then you just MIGHT be dazzled by FREAKONOMICS.  If I tell you that the company that issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts, thinking that it is cutting costs, is probably increasing its overhead, and this fact astounds you  - if you must ask "But how?" - then yes, buy FREAKONOMICS and be dazzled.  Mostly what FREAKONOMICS offers (when its conclusions can be trusted) is just what we used to call "common sense."  But since America has been reduced to a bunch of corpulent, brain-dead zombies staring vacuously at that box of SURVIVORS, and AMERICAN IDOLS, and LOST knuckleheads, good old-fashioned common sense now appears to dazzle the dead (when you can sever them from that box and put a real book in their hands, that is).  I dove into FREAKONOMICS hoping to find my purchase worthwhile.  I got no further than page 13 when my fears were realized: everything would require second-guessing and verifying.  On that page, Smug Mug tells us (based on a single report by the Institute Of Medicine) that "drinking eight glasses of water a day has never actually been shown to do a thing for your health."  Fortunately, I read YOUR BODY'S MANY CRIES FOR WATER by Doctor F. Batmanghelidj over a decade ago so I already knew what a bunch of bunk that was.  In chapter 4, Smug Mug "proves" that legalizing abortion in 1973 with the Roe v. Wade decision was responsible for a national drop in the crime rate.  This represents the centerpiece of his book, both literally and ideologically.  The first thing the reader must accept is that there really has been a significant drop in crime since the early 1990s.  On page 92, the author acknowledges that the police in Atlanta were discovered to be underreporting crime in the early `90s in hopes of landing the 1996 Olympics.  Well, would police forces nationally have an incentive to underreport crime generally if it has actually dramatically increased since the `90s as predicted?  True, being honest might be means to an increased budget, but it sure would make your department appear inept and unable to maintain control.  And surely the Chamber Of Commerce and the big business interests would frown on that public perception.  Let me ask, do YOU actually feel you're less likely to be the victim of a crime now than you did in the early 1990s?  That's funny, me neither.  There's so much crime now that some of what was once reported to the police agencies goes unreported, and recently, an ex-police officer friend told me that cops can no longer engage in some of the micro-policing they were able to do in the `80s and `90s because crime is so out-of-control now.  In dismissing other possible factors responsible for the huge drop in crime (if this claim is a verity), Dubner states that increased police personnel accounts for only 10% of the drop.  Having a bit more insight into the nature of police work than does the average civilian, it's funny that I find myself even contending with the stats Smug Mug uses that actually WORK AGAINST his theory: I believe the wide-scale hiring of police officers since the early `90s could have impacted the crime rate only minimally - less than the 10% - while actually increasing the municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly.  And Dubner concludes that right-to-carry firearm laws "simply don't bring down crime."  (Be sure to read the utterly fascinating book, GUNFIGHTERS, HIGHWAYMEN & VIGILANTES by Roger D. McGrath, for a decidedly different and scholarly viewpoint!)  In dismissing all explanations for the unexpected drop in crime except legalized abortion, I didn't notice any mention of the tremendous increase in homeschooling and the proliferation of private schools since the early `90s, and I wonder if that might have some statistical bearing.  Ya think?   Yes, I think Smug Mug is selective.  He calls some abortions a "crude and drastic sort of insurance policy."  Not "immoral."  Not "sinful."  But then I didn't expect Smug Mug to call a sin a sin.    And even if Levitt and Dubner's hypothesis is correct, that abortions have lowered crime, the fact remains that not every aborted child would have eventually murdered an innocent person, but every aborted child was an innocent person murdered.  So why are we even discussing this?  I'll tell you why: because the pro-choice folks can feel a slightly shifting consensus, and now they're pulling out all the stops, trying to "statistically" convince the masses that they're safer with all those unborn potential criminals missing.  I find this repulsive!  (And there are studies indicating that those missing people have, and will continue to have, a negative economic impact on society.)  I won't even go into chapter 5, What Makes A Perfect Parent?  Suffice to say that as usual (surprise! surprise!) all the statistics Dubner employs nearly always seem to confirm the rightness of the liberal dogma on each issue.  Funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs.  Just know that if you're a working mother, you haven't cheated your child in the least, but if you're a dad who thinks that an occasional spanking is in order, you are "unenlightened."  If your kid is watching lots of TV, it isn't turning the "child's brain to mush."  (No word on whether or not it's turning his/her morals to mush though.)  And the studies (that we are called to pay attention to) show "that a child's character wasn't much affected whether or not he was sent to day care, whether he had one parent or two, whether his mother worked or didn't, whether he had two mommies or two daddies or one of each."  (I've often wondered what might have happened to me if my Mom, who was home most of the time, hadn't been there to hammer the dangers of drugs into my head day after day, year after year, while I was growing up in the `60s and `70s.)  I've given FREAKONOMICS two stars because I did find the section on the naming of children very interesting, as well as the story of Stetson Kennedy's fight against the "three Ks."  But if you're smarter than I am, you'll borrow this book from your library rather than paying money for it.  Economically speaking, that's just "common cents." 
 To customer before me, you camera D200 might be on recall. Please check the Nikon website for more info. You have described the exact recall problem. Good luck! BTW, have you tried or someone tried this battery on a D70? I am thinking to consolidate and have all greys batteries rather than black for the D70 and grays from the D200. 
 I found this book a total waste of money, starting from totally useless route descriptions with incorrect altitudes of the camps and non-existing penitentes fields featured in them and finishing with an awfully bad and old photos. Basically, one will gain more by doing search for your planned route on Google 
 I enjoyed this book at first, but after reading James Bishop's book "Dynamic Becoming" he showed that most of the stuff published in "Striking Thoughts" comes from other authors.  It is still good info, but clearly this is not Bruce Lee's words 
 It may be like shouting into a hurricane to say this, but I really feel this book is fabulously overrated. I am a 30 year-old would be author who came to High Fidelity hoping to learn something, but I came away empty-handed.  Parts of the structure are interesting, especially the first chapter and what follows from it directly, but the quirky language becomes tiresome and repetative; the narrator is ultimately too pathetic to relate to and his world-view painfully claustrophobic; supporting characters are cute but two-dimensionsal; and the ending is pure feel-good screenplay fluff.  But most of all I was hoping to learn an effective technique of weaving popular culture into a narrative (akin to some of the finer moments in 'Middlesex' by R. Eugenides) and found no such thing.  The narrator cares about nothing more than pop culture, yet he hardly ruminates about it's content, but resorts to pointless listing-- those aren't the kind of cultural references I find valuable.  I've heard that Hornby has written better books with greater depth but there are too many other writers out there for me to give him another chance any time soon 
 This was the first book by this author that I had started to read. Perhaps, that was my first mistake. I truly did not like this book -- the characters, the plot, the overall language in the book -- all disgusted me. I could not bring myself to finish the book. If the rest of this author's books, are anything like this one, I think I will be avoiding this author's work 
 I find it hard to believe that the author has even visited Cuba, let alone lived there. Not being an American, I have legally spent quite a bit of time in Havana myself - and not as a tourist, either - and there are so many glaring inconsistencies between this book and the realities it describes, I would have sworn it was written by someone who was only going on third-party descriptions and their own wild imagination.  Jineterismo is indeed a gaping wound in Cuban society, but it certainly doesn't work the way this book describes it - quite far from it. There is a lot of uncommon ground between Cuban-style jineterismo and generic western-type prostitution, and this author's take is remarkably closer to the second one. To give an example: no Cuban jinetera would be "sitting by herself" anywhere, let alone at a "cafe near the Habana Libre Hotel," and with a "stack of papers" in front of her no less. That picture is straight out of the US, and anyone doing said things in Cuba would never, ever be mistaken for anything other than a foreigner, not even by the naivest American tourist. More importantly, the jineteras sell romance more than they sell sex, which is amongst the most alluring things about them. One may pay them, but one is always left with the impression that they're being generous and "helping out" someone with whom they had a good time, not contemptuously paying a professional for services rendered as described in the book.  The book may be enjoyable as a read - I don't know, as personally I was unable to finish it for being so annoyed with the false picture it paints. My own impression is that it is naive and rather sophomoric. If you do choose to read it, please keep in mind it is pure fiction. If a literary glimpse into modern-day Cuba (shocking underworld included) is what you're after, there are far better books out there by Cuban authors, and even an excellent relevant collection of short stories and book excerpts 
 We read this book in class at the graduate level and her ideas caused a great deal of controversy. Some loved her and others were sure she was radical with no agenda except for blaming others for her anger. I thought that her book was non-academic because it was not an academic piece of writing. Color or gender have nothing to do with it. I was not impressed by her ranting against white middle class educational values because she was a beneficiary of a scholarship that helped her achieve her education. Besides, at least in this book, she can't get past her anger to give real examples of transformative education in the classroom, except to assure the reader she practiced it.  Not good enough.  Playing the race-card, flagrant self-promotion and hate speech is not enough. Being a revolutionary requires more than a polemic against the things you don't like. I wasn't impressed 
 The problem with the "classics" is that too many hacks have hacked them to pieces. My opinion of these recordings, for whatever it is worth, is that they simply do not do justice to Strauss's magnificent music.  There is a reason they are a "bargain". I would avoid this set. Sometimes a boxed set is a good deal, but this one is not. I find the entire set unspeakably dull and literally unlistenable.   In any event, this is merely my opinion. The majority of the other reviewers think its terrific.     
 If you're looking for something groundbreaking like B:TAS or "The New Batman Adventures," you'll have to look elsewhere. "The Batman" is nothing new. In fact, it's the kind of Saturday morning show you might have seen in the late-80's. This re-imagining abandons many if not all of the conventions that made the other animated shows great. No longer are the villains multi-layered and complex; rather they are the standard cardboard cutouts that exist solely for the purpose of fighting the hero. Further, Batman mythos mainstay James Gordon is abandoned in favor of two "hipper" more "kid-friendly" replacements that serve the same function. On the plus side, the animation is good; but it is still not enough to make up for the series' shortcomings. I understand the second season was better, but if so, they must have made some major changes. All in all, a disappointment. 
 This is the first time I read J.L. Borges. The stories, somehow disturb me. Some are confusing, but all of them attract the reader because the are so well written and are full of memorable sentences. If you want to have a reference in latinamerican narrative you have to read Borges 
 I did not particularly care for this book - too broad and not easy to read - too general 
 Poor quality. Does not seem to have any background music. I'm not sure why 
 I think that Hobson's book is good in a way that it provides a counter-argument to Eurocentricism such as found in David Landes' the Wealth and Poverty of Nations.  Beyond that, however, I find that Hobson is lacking in any real substance and rather chooses to bash Eurocentrist's arguments rather than making any of his own.  He resorts to many of the same pitfalls that he sees in Eurocentric authors by presenting the East as the sole site of pre-1800 civilization.  I understand that he is trying to undermine Eurocentric arguments, but by being so obviously one-sided he is defeating his own cause 
 Since I have received this piece of s**t I have had to call twice because parts were either damaged or not working.  You have to call several times to get through to a customer service rep and they never answer when you leave a message 
 First off I'd like to tell you that this is only the second Star Wars book I've ever read, 'Jedi Search' being the first. I actually liked the first book, it drew upon the Star Wars lore well and was a decent read. However, this book made me groan in so many places that I felt almost compelled to create an account here to have a little rant about it (BE WARNED, THIS MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS). Thusly:  How much of the book was wasted with overly long descriptions? It reminds me of a 'Little Britain' sketch where a woman author is dictating her new book and starts reading the Bible out to make up the space! I don't mind the story being 20-odd pages shorter if it comes to the point!  For some bizarre reason the author seems to have taken every opportunity to 'ground' the story by CONSTANTLY relating to the Star Wars films. For example, when Wedge and the scientist go to that forest-resort planet and meet the alien ambassador there, he says something along the lines of: I was actually in the cantina in Mos Eisley when Luke met Han and Chewbacca, little did I know the brush I had with history there.... GAHHHHHHH!!! WHY!? HOW DID HE KNOW!? it didn't need it!! *bangs head on desk*  He does this throughout the two books I've read so far!! how about the will to stick your own neck out and come up with something new without 'proving' that it's true by telling the readers that it was from a certain scene in one of the films?  Then there's Admiral Daala. Made an Admiral because of her brilliant military skills and quick thinking.... so what is she doing in this? she's reviewing recordings of speeches given by Tarkin over military tactics and following them to the letter and losing! It's only the end of the second book and she's down to 1 star destroyer! She should live up to her reputation and at least have a few successful campaigns before the inevitable happens. (i.e. the rebellion win)  He then goes on to waste an absolutely brilliant idea, that of having a Jedi Academy (the point of the trilogy!). There's so much that could have been done here - new and original training for the Jedi, but no - he has the Jedi go two-by-two into the forest (holding hands?) to *sense* things... it's meant to be a sci-fi series! something could have been done to make this SO much better!  I was incensed to find that Luke was actually made 'boring' in this book. Part of my motivation for starting to read the series in the first place was to see how Luke had grown. It all started very promisingly in the first book, having learnt that Luke had turned to the dark side and come through it all with the love of his friends and was now more powerful than ever! (cool! I thought). It got to the stage where I'd dread coming back to the Jedi parts of the story because he was so dull.  The other trainee Jedi needed serious character development (they were 1 dimensional!) - entering every scene with Luke surveying them noting how well they were progressing just wasn't good enough.  As other reviewers have said - one of his students goes rogue, somehow gains the knowledge of building a super-lightsabre (great idea btw!! we need more of that!) then is discovered burnt to death in his quarters... and Luke just meditates about it!? *grr*  Okay all that being said it was 'okay' and on the strength of the first book I will be reading the next book (it's like a car accident - you've just got to look!). 
 The book is well presented but lot of the coverage is very ambiguous and situational to real railroading not focused onthe aspects of model railroading. I would have expected to see more coverage of layout building, tips and trick, experiences from fellow modelers, but none of that kind to suit my pallate. Rather dissappointed, I must say 
 I spent 3 hours putting this thing together.  All the parts were there and it all fit together okay.  After I finished I noticed that it seemed small for my Deck.  I bought this unit becuase it says it measures 11'8" square.  Well it actually measures 9'8" square.  So, now I have to take it down box it up and start again 
 Mr. Perret somehow succeeded in writing an incredibly boring book about a man who lived an extrodinary life.  The book is also marred by continuous misstatements of fact and poor research.  To those looking for a good book on JFK, I advise you to take a look at Nigel Hamilton's "JFK: Reckless Youth" for illumination on his early life, Richard Reeves' "Profile in Power" for a broad look at his presidency, and Arthur Schlessinger Jr.'s "A Thousand Days" for an intimate look at his presidency that also gives you an excellent sense of who he was as a person.  "Jack" isn't worth the time 
 I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.  
 This book is awful.  I read it, and I couldn't wait to finish it.  I would have flipped it in the trash can except I had to read it for school.  The characters are pathetic, there is no grasp of dialogue, and the author admits that it is the same thing as an F. Scott Fitzgerald book that was already written.  How it became a Newberry winner I will never know 
 perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations, but i was really disappointed with this record the songwriting is weak, the singing is weak, and the arrangements are dull  something kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same, but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly, you can sing most of them after one listen, they are so simplistic and cliched 
 Wow.  This movie's bad.  But it's good for a laugh if you're in the mood for some brainless fun.  Patrick Bergen gives one of the great over-the-top performances of all time as the psycho husband.  Among the many major plot holes:  Hubby smacks Julia because he thought she was checking out their new neighbor on his boat.  Then a few days later he's arranging for them both to go sailing with the same guy, on his boat!  (Wouldn't the psychotically jealous husband try to keep his wife away from the man he thinks she's lusting after?)  Also, the fact that she would fake her drowning in the OCEAN - but flush her wedding ring (halfway) down the TOILET - is not the smartest move to say the least.  Might wanna just ditch that ring in the ocean while you're faking your own death next time, Julia!  Gotta admit though, I loved that the psycho hubby would sneak into Julia's house and actually take time to rearrange the cans in the cupboard before he hides.  What a neat freak.  The final plot hole involves her new boyfriend in Iowa, who would likely be more interested in Patrick Bergen than Julia, if you know what I'm saying 
 Well, with the kind of judgmental attitude Barbara Johnson has toward others different from herself, she's going down to the fiery place.  And fast.  For the record, Christian = Acceptance, not Christian = Intolerance 
 The title was rather seductive ... but I was disappointed, if validated. I am by no means mom of the year, but I think I already follow most of what the book suggests. This book is likely good for parents who are gobsmacked by newly emerged bad behaviors and recalcitrance, but those of us who have spent any time with the "Spririted," "Explosive" and "Active/Alert" child books will have seen/implemented most of the recommendations already.   
 My mother bought this for me for Christmas. She used the "available new and used" section to get it a little cheaper. She ended up paying $160 or so. When I put this on my wish list I thought that this hardcover version would be the Arabic-English/English-Arabic, considering that it was $175 and the paperback of the Arabic-English only was available for $45. As it turns out, this is only the hardcover of the Arabic-English only. So for one, my mother paid an additional $115 for only the hardcover version of a book that I could have gotten in the paperback for $45. I still do not have the English-Arabic of the Hans Wehr edition 
 I do not understand why this book is still in print, or at the very least is not published with a huge disclaimer on the front cover.  The author himself has admitted in more recent books (_Blinded by the Right_ and others) that he was *lying* when he wrote this book, and that he deliberately spun every piece of information about Anita Hill to discredit her. 
 When Fantasia came out in 1938, it bombed.  Many years later, the movie received the acclaim it deserved.  Fantasia has enchanted me since I was a child, and I eagerly awaited Fantasia 2000.  The possibilities!  I was sure Disney would come up with something to rival the original.  What I saw was a humorless, boring mish-mash with only a few bright spots.  The opening segment of whales flying through space was embarrassingly bad.  Silly flamingos also fell flat.  Donald Duck as Noah was terrific.  The Gershwin piece was ok, but not for Fantasia.  And what should have been the crowning achievement, a forest nymph battling to save her beloved forest, was predictable and stale.  This film was almost a complete waste of my time and money.  I heartily, heartily, endorse the orginal Fantasia as a timeless classic for all ages 
 Typically Penguin Classics does a great job with translating foriegn classics, but in the case of Madame Bovary, they do not.  I read two chapters in this book and had to keep going back and re-reading sentences and had the most difficult time trying to figure out what was trying to be conveyed.  Finally, I drove over to my local library and checked out the Bantam Classics version and I am extremely pleased that I did.  It reads so much better and is actually entertaining.  Get the book, but get Lowell Bair's translation 
 I saw this movie and was shocked at the contents, considering that it was aimed at children. It starts out with the gypsy Esmeralda doing a very provocative stripper style pole dance. While no stripping happened, there wasn't much other difference in the style of dance. Later in the movie, one of the men is obsessing over her in a manner I would never want my children to see. He sings a song about how she will burn in hell if he doesn't have her, and meanwhile a vision of her provocative dancing is playing out in the flames of a fire. Regardless of the rest of the movie, these two scenes make this highly innapropriate for children. Not to mention that the story is very untrue to the novel, which had a tragic ending rather than a happy ever after one. 
 Ms. McNaught is a fantastic fictional novelist.  It is hard to find any other writer in this genre who has created so many memorable stories and characters.  I can read her books over and over and never grow tired of the material.  But, this book is lacking her "magical touch".  It is not her best work.  It has more filler than story line and will not end up on my bookshelves.  If you love her work and must read this book than get it at the library.  Some of her best titles includethe following:Paradise,  Double Standard, Until You, Once and Always, Something Wonderful, Kindom of Dreams and Night Whispers.  Read these first and you won't be disappointed 
 Its super cheap, does not work at all, will struggle with the thinnest of hairs.  Stay away!! 
 A picture showing James Dean and Elia Kazan visiting the East of Eden set claims they're doing so in 1955 when they were probably actually visiting it in 1954 (the year they actually made EOE). I never thought of Kazan as being one of the greatest directors ever and I still don't. He's certainly no Alfred Hitchcock or Cecil B. deMille or Steven Spielberg. 
 This is a kids book. First few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book. 
 "This little book has no `hidden agenda.' It is offered in the most cheerful and open polemical spirit, as an attack on a crooked president and a corrupt and reactionary administration" (1).   So says Christopher Hitchens in the preface. All though it may be the case that the book is cheerful and polemical it is also, I'm afraid to say, fairly clumsy and transparently superficial.   Hitchens begins in the preface with the possibility that Clinton may have impregnated and African American woman during his term as Governor in Arkansas only to drop the implication based on the relevant DNA data. Hitchens has proven nothing here; he has merely introduced what we already know; Clinton's sexual infidelities and callous disregard for his family and other females along the way.   -The majority of this slim book seeks to prove that Clinton in fact raped who was never given a fair hearing. Hitchens more or less accepts her testimony out of hand because he believes she is a good and honorable person and has not "agenda" in making up such dribble. Hmmm....Oh that's right, no one could ever gain anything from being associated in a sex scandal with the President (see Monica's story).   -But there is a deeper problem with this complaint. The president's sexual behavior has nothing to do with the relevant political factors of his leadership and diplomacy. If Clinton is guilty of sexual assault then he should be tried as an ordinary citizen. But Hitchens' evidence is merely from second-hand testimony at best, and at worst it is derived from an awkward transcript of an interview with Al Gore in which he refused to comment.   -The only worth while material in this book is Chapter 5, Clinton's War crimes. In it he discusses Clinton's bombing of the Al-Shifa plant in Khartoum in 1998, a clear war crime based on the evidence presented. I urge you to check this book out of the library, skip the sexual babble, and turn to this section as it is one of the view discussions on the topic aside from Noam Chomsky's comments in 9/11, which Hitchens would later blast him for as surprising as that sounds. 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 Advice is ok, but the photographed kitchens easily cost $200,000 or more.  Not everyone has 25 foot vaulted ceilings with views or $15k Viking stoves.   If your planning on designing a masterpiece and live in Malibu or Manhatten, then this is your book.  If your like me, and will end up at Lowes, you may find "Kitchens That Work" by Edic more interesting 
 I loved "The List of 7", but this book pales next to it, and is a disappointment.  The characters and story are good. But Sparks' fall from grace and the things he does during it are disappointing and I think unnecessary to the story.  It takes away from his lustre as being the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes.  This is not a book I will read again 
 I am just about done with this book and I did not like it at all. The shorts about the world of Capitol were the most interesting, but the bulk of the book regarding Jason Worthing, Justice and Lared is just way to shallow, simple and uninteresting that I had to struggle to finish that part. The blatant religious undertones are disturbing, even though Card tries to couch them in somewhat secular ideas.  Card seems to have not bothered to develop the individual characters, instead opting for a papier mache cast of cardboard cutouts to promote his thin plot. Moral lessons in a work of fiction are fine, but at least make the vehicle something that makes you want to get in a drive!  Card amazed me with Ender and Speaker for the Dead. I have been searching for another Card series to keep me entertained, but so far, much of his other work has left me dry.  
 There seemed to be no beginning or middle.  No idea if there was an end because I couldn't finish it.  I kept nodding off until one of those "cybernotes" numbers popped up, the ones us gentle readers were superciliously instructed to download early in the book, or have "a friend" download them if we didn't have internet access nor particularly cared.  I got no real sense of time and place despite all the references to clothing, food and what came over Mr. Kane's short-wave.  There was little real content and way too many bloated words. I couldn't like any of the characters at all-- the ones that had any development.  Ruby LaPointe is a self-centered, vain whiner and Jean-Luc is an insufferable know-it-all stuck parenting her.  Anne-Marie barely exists unless she's taking tap-dance lessons or Ruby gets aggravated at her for having the nerve to be sleepy at midnight because Ruby just had to drag the kids to a "dish night" movie on a school night.  Does Anne-Marie even go to school and if so, where?  I probably missed that somewhere in the cloud of bloated words that showed me little.  I glanced at the cybernotes.  I don't recommend reading them unless you want to be textually condescended to and don't mind multiple spelling errors (H.L. Menkin and the Barring Land Bridge?) 
 ...Meaning, I am not enamored of this book.  It was overlong, silly, poorly written, repetitive, it had cardboard characters, and was nothing but a soap opera which happened to be set in early 20th-century Japan.  To top it off, the sex scenes were gruesome and boring.    I was hoping this book was better than the movie (which I saw first), but it wasn't.  Also, why glorify the lives of women who were basically just high-priced prostitutes, who sold their virginity and selves to the highest bidder?    Real Japanese culture could never be as dull as this book.  
 I was disappointed in this book.  The art and techniques illustrated are of the type one might expect to see on a TV Craft Show.   I would instead recomment Robert Wade's watercolor book.     
      I hated this book even when I was a kid. Lucy Maud Montgomery didn't know how to "create" a happy marriage between Anne and Gilbert because her own marriage was so disasterous. In real life, Lucy Maud's only friends were women and her negative attitude towards her husband is reflected in this book. Gilbert should have been outgoing, interesting, debonaire and REAL. Instead, he's a flat cardboard character who hides in the background. Although Anne is only in her late 30's, she's a prim and repressed matron who feels life has passed her by as she watches her children grow. And the kids are annoying! Saintly Walter is being primed as the sacrificial lamb and martyr--a destiny he fulfills in "Rilla of Ingleside." There's something weirdly disturbing and unreal about them...and their parents. Believe it or not--the most fascinating character is "Christine," the sultry widow who flirts with Gilbert and tries to "steal" him away from Anne--sort of! Christine is a little naughty and not very nice (by early 1900's standards) and she spices up this otherwise dull book.  
 This is not a book I would recomend for anyone serious interested in rune casting. It tells nothing of the history of runes and it seems if the writer figured out what tarot card closely matches each rune and then wrote the book based off that info. There are much better books out there for rune casting 
 With this book, I was expecting Zinn to go into more detail about America in the 20th century, but it is essentially the 20th century chapters of People's History of the United States taken out and labeled as a new and different book. If you have an older version of Pepole History of the United States by Howard Zinn, the Twentieth Century might be good because of the chapters relating to the elder Bush and Clinton administrations. The rest of the chapters are in people's history. However, recent version the people history of the united states do contain the extra chapters so if it would be better  to just get a later version of People's History of the United States instead if you don't have a copy yet 
 Lonestar has accomplished one stratigic plan, have all songs sound like they belong on Lonely Grill.  Their newest album remains true to this belief. While it worked twice, it's getting a little tiresome not only for the ear, but even Richey sounds a bit bored as well.   Basically watered down pop, with no fizz. Try Lonely Grill instead 
 I loved the original book "The Sherbrooke Bride".  I have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse.  The only reason I have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters.  Otherwise, this book is a complete waste of time.  If you want to be thoroughly entertained I suggest reading the first book which happens to be about Alex and Douglass.  Skip the second for Ryder's story is so-so.  I would then read Sinjun's search for love.  It is very funny and captivating.  Ms. Coulter generally writes really good books.  She should have quit while she was ahead 
 This Cd I feel is too long. I can't stand Foreigner anymore, they used to be great. Awful edits like Urgent, Jukebox Hero, & Waiting for a Girl Like You have to be changed. And that boring ballad, what is it?????? I Want to Know What Love Is....Irritating for 2 minutes. And that singer, he kind of raises his voice too much. Not one of the best bands I have ever heard. Other irritating songs are HEADKNOCKER, Blue Morning, & Head games and they kinda suck. They just give me on my nerves. This is noise.....buy any album from Dire Straits insted. Dire Straits are the best..................................... 
 I will never ever recommend this author. She may claim to be a Christian, but her behavior is anything but. This person has no business counseling parents of homosexuals, as it is clear she has no understanding of them. She describes them as something that formed wrong, flowers that didn't open. I have news for you, Ms. Johnson. God doesn't make mistakes. Each person is made that way for a reason, just because you can't get out of a stone age interpretation of the Bible, don't infect other parents and friends of gay people with your poisonous fake christian "love". I want to go wash my hands in lysol. It is because of attitudes like hers that Christians like me are portrayed as a bunch of whacko nutjobs 
 Hi, I purchased this book, and found out I had wasted my money (by my own fault, i will admit).  There is nothing in this book that is useful.  Dissappointing... 
 I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the "laws" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS 
 I was thrilled to see a style of dance that I don't have access to made available to me via DVD and went ahead and gave it a go. While I admire all of the performers for getting in front of the camera, which takes a lot of courage for some, I couldn't help noticing that the worse the dancer, the more special effects I was bombarded with. The best dancers performed on a bare stage with a plain backdrop so that all you could focus on was them - there was no need to disguise their lack of technical skill with computer generated overlays of CHEESY headstones, iron crosses, and gothic cathedral windows, peat bogs, or swamps (Give me a break!). Other performers projected the attitude of "Ooooh, look at me, I can do figure eights and I'm wearing a black corset!" (So what. Take off the corset, put on a choli and attend a few dance workshops and then show me what you can do.) Overall I came out feeling like I'd witnessed a Jr. High talent show where the "popular" girl and her synchphants got up and flopped and swished their way through a choreography to the latest Black Eyed Peas song that they threw together the night before over pizza and M&Ms with everyone applauding when the music stopped because it was the nice thing to do. (You know, like in "Napoleon Dynamite") Either that or I'd just witnessed a lot of first year Film Student's final project videos. As a dance movement, Racks Gothique is pretty legit, and I think that with a little more effort, a better representation of could be produced than this one. 
 I have both this book and Revealed and by far I recommend the Revealed book.  This book is ok to use as a companion guide with Revealed, but I did not find it nearly as helpful.  I mainly bought the Dummy book to see if I could get a different point of view about sites, restuarants, etc. and I did in some cases, but I will be using the Revealed book as my main guide when I go back to Maui this year.  
 I expected a more in-depth look at the female aspect of the Godhead, but this book is filled with mostly letters from clients and references to Her in religious history.  Her other books like "Life on the Other Side" and "The Other Side and Back" are better reads since she tells more of her family's, minister's, and her own experiences rather than relying primarily on the words of clients and history books 
 Unfortunately, the engineers decided to add some gimicky stereo effects to the remastering -- moving a drum roll from left speaker to right, putting Felix Cavaliere on the left for one phrase, then on the right for the next, back to the left, etc.  This is all unnecessarily distracting 
 Alright people, Not to be overly critical.... but do you have any idea what these kids are singing about on kidzbop?  Turn off the light- Starts off with "it gets so lonely in this bed"!!!! HELLO!?!?!  Shape of my heart- "Touch me now don't bother if every second it makes me weaker"!!! Hello?!?!?!  Fallin'- "How do you give me so much pleasure"!!! Hello?!?!?  Everything you want- "But under skinned knees and the skid marks Past the places where you used to learn" (This is in reference to failed relationships, and what went wrong) Hello?!?!?!  Who let the dogs out- Is about men forcefully picking up  women at a party! Hello!?!?!  come on over- "I'm not just talkin about your sexuality, but i can't help myself when u put ur hands on me (put ur hands on me), It's paradise, when u and I, Get close, get tight ,I wanna wanna wanna, go on all nite, i wanna play that game with you baby,listen ta me"..... HELLO!?!?!?!   These are just a few of the songs; trust me, more of them are just as raunchy. Now, I admit, I havent heard the songs, I just looked at the track list and was appauled. Honestly, the vast majority of these songs are totally inappropriate for children to be listening to, let alone singing. The executives at whatever company that makes Kidzbop should be ashamed of themselves. Dont be mindless consumers and buy this CD because your kids like it. Kids tend to like alcohol and drugs too (obviously not the same age group. but you get the point.)but you wouldnt supply them with it now would you?! You are parents for a reason. Be an adult and protect your kids from the stuff they like that may not be good for them. Otherwise our nation is going to go bad real soon. There are plenty of clean musicians out there that your kids will enjoy listening to.  
 This dreary account of a foul-mouthed adulterer who consistently makes the wrong choices might remind some of other tragic characters in great fiction, such as the protagonist in An American Tragedy or in  Crime and Punishment or Madame Bovary.  But the difference here is that Bob Dubois never learns, he repeatedly does the dumb thing, whether it is adultery or use of dope or abusing his wife or his poor innocent children.  One can hardly help being disgusted by a man who does not seem to have a brain in his body.  Only a moron would break all the windows in his own car when he is short of money for his wife and kids, or wreck his home, or booze and do dope when he does not know how to pay for necessary care for his child.  As for all the stuff about voodoo this may be interest to some but to me was a bore.  Surely the account of the Haitians' plight is distressing, but it helps to make this book a depressing one.  Frankly I was glad when I finished this pretentious and not well-written book, and thought Dubois got what he asked for and deserved 
 I bought this movie on the basis of the many excellent reviews, but as I was disappointed on so many levels, I can't help wondering if we all saw the same movie!  An extremely sluggish and generally unbelievable storyline, ridiculous 'acting,' unsympathetic characters, what's to like?  Worst of all, after laboring mightily to get all the different main characters together for what appears to be the great denoumant of the tale, the whole thing is ruined by the antihero suddenly going berserk at the inn and getting himself killed in the process.  Why?  Because the hitherto heartless, calculating and cold-blooded murderer suddenly thinks he sees ghosts, and decides that in a fit of conscience he never had before, he should chop the entire inn to ribbons.  What appears most abundantly clear to me is that the producers of this turkey suddenly realised that they were way overbudget, and decided to end the movie as quickly as they could, and a good thing too.  Rubbish!  If you want to see a good samurai film, see 'Seven Samurai' and leave this garbage on the shelf 
 This book teaches just the basics. For more info, you need to get other books. The samples use OpenGL and are useless for real game coding. There are better terrain books available 
 Lovers of the macabre know all about the horrors birthed of Wisconsin. Exhibit A is Edward Gein, a simpleminded sort of fellow prone to ambling around the small berg of Plainfield wearing a smile and his plaid hunter's cap. No one thought on Ed much, seeing as how he was a harmless chap always ready to lend a hand when it came to babysitting or helping out around the farm. Sure, his mother Augusta was a bible thumper with a poor opinion of the local ladies, but Ed was a right square guy. Even when a couple of women in the area disappeared, no one thought Gein had anything to do with it. Then the cops checked his farmhouse and found scenes of carnage right out of an Asian horror film. Exhibit B is Jeffrey Dahmer, a simpleminded sort of fellow prone to ambling around Milwaukee between his shifts at a chocolate factory. Jeff's private activities were, how should we say, peculiar in the extreme. After the police unearthed the soul shattering horrors tucked away in the nooks and crannies of his apartment, most of the man's fellow residents as well as the rest of the country began wondering why Wisconsin didn't have a capital punishment law on the books.  Yes sir, Wisconsin and its two odd ducks make for interesting reading. Potentially interesting viewing, too, if the documentary "Wisconsin Death Trip" had done its job. Unfortunately, Gein and Dahmer receive little attention here. Instead, the filmmakers posit that something downright sinister has always been going on in the region, and they promptly set out to prove it by culling late nineteenth and early twentieth century stories from the Black River Falls newspaper. You won't find quaint articles about which woman won a blue ribbon for the tastiest pie at the county fair in this movie. Nor will you see chamber of commerce reports lamenting the increasing cost of bacon grease. Nope, the stories these guys dug up consist of the bizarre, the awful, and the heinous. It's the story of Pauline L'Allemand, a supposed opera singer who moved into the area and lived there until she went insane. There's also the tale of thirteen year old John Anderson, a fugitive from the law after he went on an enigmatic killing spree. The most memorable figure in "Wisconsin Death Trip" is Mary Sweeney, a woman addicted to narcotics who went on window breaking excursions in the area for years. Murders, self-immolations, hangings, abandoned children, and a diphtheria epidemic find a place here too.  The documentary, sad to say, is about as interesting as watching the paint dry on your grandfather's Model T. Nearly all of the stories come to us through black and white reenactments coupled with a "spooky" voiceover that seems to scream "This stuff is scary!" Problem is most of the news articles in the movie aren't that scary; they are, in fact, fairly common for periodicals of this time. As someone who has spent a fair amount of time digging through old newspapers in order to do research, I can attest to the fact that lots of strange things happened in America, and not just rural America, back in the day. A diphtheria epidemic in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, you say? This isn't surprising at all in a time before modern medical techniques and improved sanitation rendered many afflictions scarce to nonexistent. As I watched "Wisconsin Death Trip," I began to think this was a film made for the consumption of cosmopolitan audiences who could look at the events onscreen as confirmation of their worst fears regarding those evil, Sinclair Lewis type provincials. Even worse, the filmmakers try to tie all of the events to one specific region when it's obvious from the voiceover that said occurrences took place all over Wisconsin.  "Wisconsin Death Trip" even tries to tie the weirdness of yesteryear into strange goings on in the Black River Falls of today, but that largely fails as well. The police found a body out in the woods? Well, the police seem to find bodies out in the woods quite frequently all over the country. Law enforcement officials also discover them in houses, cars, rivers, hospital beds, streets, and every other place human beings frequent on a day to day basis. The events discussed in "Wisconsin Death Trip" seem strange only if you've been living in cryogenic stasis for your entire life--which, I hear, resembles in no small way the experience of residing in Manhattan. The filmmakers could have done a better job had they simply rehashed the Gein and Dahmer cases, which would easily provide enough weirdness for several documentaries with a lot of strangeness left over for more. The DVD version contains a commentary track, deleted scenes, and a making of featurette showing us all of the people who worked on the reenactments. Yawn. I recommend almost any horror film or true crime book over this documentary. You'll thank me in the morning.  
 While the topics are thought-provoking, the most common line in the book is "consult with a member of the Wealth Protection Alliance."  It really doesn't tell you what to do otherwise.  I think the authors should include a coupon equal to the price of the book if you do see a member of the Wealth Protection Alliance.  Overall, though, I simply don't think the book is worth the high price charged for it 
 Reading this book reminded me of how you sometimes watch a bad movie just to see how bad it can get.  I did a lot skimming (fast forwarding) to see if it was consistent right up to the end.  It was.  Don't waste your time.  This was my first Iles book and will surely be my last 
 I am re-reading parts of the book now, as I intend to write something on Reagan comparing Copjec with Massumi's account. Or did I say compare? there is nothing to compare, in fact. Massumi accomplishes with bravado what no psychoanalyst could ever dream of doing. and not because of a lack of intelligence.  Let me only say, I find the book to be frustratingly pretentious, symptomatically reductive and overall such a poor poor account of much more complex realities. to begin a text by quoting the famous critique of structuralism that 'structures don't walk in the streets', and then to cite favorably Lacan's offensively "academic" presentation to students who, at least for a while, we finally getting involved in something important - that in itself is such a telling start. or to say later that Decartes caused the democratic revolution, or that without him psychoanalysis would not have been possible - check your history books people!!!  I keep reading and I get more and more upset - what is this psychoanalytic disease that is spreading everywhere, I thought D&G had already killed it. apparently not. only look at Zizek's popularity these days, with all the ridiculous things he has said about Lenin (who after all is so much larger than any Lacanian psychoanalyst). Lacan should have said it to his own students: all that you want is another master...  A bad book to read, even though as good as they make them in lacanian circles these days. read some deleuze, or better guattari. that's going to take you to a different planet 
 I have read or listened to the entire Cat Who series and this one was a so far off base that finishing is was painful. There was no mystery The 'Barn" is lost almost as an after thought to fill space. I feel that someone tried to pass this off as a Ms Braun's story to meet a number of words requirement.  There was no plot development even close to the of past Cat Who books.  This was on book I wish I had never purchased. 
 i read this book the reveng of the whale.it is about a huge sperm whale that attacks a ship that is trying to capturen it.they are trying to kill it beacuse of the sperm oil it has.they bring it back to land and sell it.i didnt like the book becase it didnt really have a main charecter.all it talked about is what the ship did and how they capiutur the whales.i also didnt like it because i thought it was going to have more action in it.most of the time ther just sailing and not really doing anything really exiting.it also dont really have a story line all it talkes about is what the ship is doing.it has no charecter conflicts.i was expecting more fights seenes with the whale and i would have hopped the would have discribed the whale better and how it attacked the ship more.some of the things i did like about it was it had one vwery god part in it.when the capterd one of the whales.it told how the got it and what they had to do to get it.i also like the pictures in the book it showed what the whales looked like and all the tools they had.i really didnt like this book but if you read it mabey you will u might be suprised 
 This is a bad movie not only because it doesn't fit chronologically in terms of feel and content.  It's like this film attempts to create Turtles psychaitry 101.  Each turtle attempts to work on and/or completely vanquish their weaknesses.  Leo learns to be a better leader by being a better individual ninja, Mikey learns to be caring and heroic in addition to his usual humorous banter, Raphael learns to control his temper by doing peaceful things while befriending children, and I believe that Donny falls in love.  It's been awhile since I've seen this film so I may have that last thing wrong. More than ten years have passed since I saw this stinker and although I don't remember every minute detail the problems that I had with it are enormous.  First, the time travel plotline is a risky stretch for this series even though the conception of the turtles is vaguely sci-fi. The television series and films haven't really gleamed upon that aspect, instead relying on action, humor, and pseudo wisdom from Splinter to pass off a complete and perfect product.  In my opinion the separate storylines of the Turtles is what ruines the movie and that is the result of the time travel plot. In particular, Leo's and Raphael's storylines simply drag the film down in an obvious way by placing them within contexts they should never be in. The pathos in these scenes is just too thick and is best in this series when it was dished out in moments. They just feel heavy handed.  That's not to say Mikey's plotline isn't just as bad, but he's allowed to get away with some of it because the kids are pretty cute, but the scene with the house burning down is right out of a war movie and is not exhilarating at all. Secondly, the action is just not there as it was before. Sure, it's still pretty bloodless, but the scenes are few and far between and boring. The Turtles have been robbed of their seemingly invincible skills when they work together and the action has been in a more battlefield context so it loses a lot of it's previous effects of catharsis.  It felt like I was watching the History Channel special about the history of the Turtles war in Japan and they lost.  Also, the explosion at the end inside the bell was straight out of a Warner Brothers cartoon and not in character with the turtles. Having the bad guy killed off with the bomb would have been inappropriate too. I'm just the kind of guy who likes(in these kinds of movies) the bad guys to get a death that you don't have to see, or feel the impact of because you can't imagine when their end comes, like falling down a bottomless pit. To me, bombs are out of the question in terms of death. Thirdly, the humor suffers as much as the action because they have little opportunity to do it and when they do it feels forced and is not funny. An example would be a moment when two of the turtles are following, or running from bad guys and they're going up stairs, lots of stairs and Mikey goes, "This is good for my calfs," I was thinking, "What, is my mom supposed to laugh at that?"  As for the Japanese men who take to American living all too well, none of it is very funny at all and reflecting on it now, it's like saying that just being drunk is funny as opposed to actually doing something funny when drunk, painfully unfunny and pointless.   Equally as pointless was the use of Casey Jones.  His character in the first movie almost steals the show at times, but in this movie he has nothing to do except watch over the Japanese men. In a way this is also doing to him what the film is doing to the turtles, forcing him to work on things that would be better worked out as moments not plotlines.  In this story the writers would have Casey Jones completely emasculated, possibly for laughs, possibly for moral. The former is definitely not the case, the latter is underdeveloped. It's like he says early in film to the turtles asking where are more people to fight, that's what we're thinking for a majority of the film.  In retrospect, the Japanese men might be a parallel for the turtles showing an example of what the writers probably think the turtles would be like if they were completely worthless.  So he has the turtles learning powerful life lessons away from Splinter to show how meaningful and worthy they are to detractors of the series.  I admit, it's a good idea but way too heavy handed.  The meaning is always better in small doses.  FINALLY, the song used in the film toward the end with the Japanese men in the bar is such a good song and is very exciting. It was used to great effect in the TV spots for the film to make the audience believe going into the theatre that it was going to an exciting, funny, action-adventure and instead they gave us this stale role reversal film that tarnishes the turtles legacy and insured that there would never be another turtles film. Oh well, at least found out the name of that song 
 I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless. 
 I wanted a book that went through the publically traded options market.  Almost everything in the book deals with employee stock options. There is very little information about trading options on the open exchange.  The real title of this book is "Employee Stock Options for Dummies" 
 Terribly weak compared to her other work 
 This is a tough read. If you wanted an interesting book about Eninem's rise to popularity and behind the scenes dirt on how Dr Dre discovered and nurtured his raw talent, then don't buy this one because this book has NONE OF THAT! Instead, every chapter is a dry account of how Eminem's music affects American society, media and culture. Really dull stuff. He even manages to make the history of rap sound boring. I've read 18 books this year but could not get through this one. The author writes for Rolling Stone and it shows... If you've ever picked up a copy of Rolling Stone and were bored to tears by the over analyzation of music and its social impact, track-by-track, then don't buy this book 
 The language in this "novel" is so pretentious and convoluted as to be largely unreadable by the average reader. It seems that James never met a comma he didn't like, and uses them to imbed all sorts or modifiers and asides. Although the graduate students may attach some deeper meaning to this, I suspect he really didn't have a clear idea of anything he wanted to say so he simply rambled on. At least with Faulkner there is a payoff. With James, all the language covolutions lead to nothing in the way of action. Random House must have had a large,unsold inventory of this book ( not surprising) so they included it in their top 100 list. James has single-handedly ruined my project of reading the all of the top 100. I will not, cannot, albeit I would like to, read,with any pleasure, the other two James books, novels perhaps, on the list, the Random House list that is 
 Some of the medical information is very helpful.  My recommendation is that this is not a book for someone under 35, it is not a book for someone who has already had a hysterectomy, nor is it for someone who has young children at home.  Her hormonal theory, that menopause is the time in life when we look beyond nurturing our families, and look to nurturing ourselves instead is slightly flawed.  Many women have hysterectomies or other forms of induced menopause at a very early age.  Do I think that my total hysterectomy at 34 (and the obvious onset of menopause) changed my ability or desire to nurture my children?  Of course not.  That's ridiculous, and if I think about it too much, it's actually offensive.  Her comments about marriage are questionable, as well.  Marriages sustain many changes, and menopause is just one of them.  Open lines of communication, deep love and commitment are certainly enough to weather the "hormonal storm."  How sad that it seems as if one point of the book is that menopause is the time to assess your marriage.  Shouldn't we be doing that every day, and re-committing ourselves to growing together?    Many reviewers have commented on some of her more non-traditional methods.  I am not a fan of tarot cards, and I'm not sure how I feel about taking medical advice from someone who diagnosed herself on several occassions, by using them.  That's just my own opinion.  I tried to look beyond that.  I just think this is another book written for people older than I am.  That's okay, but it still leaves me looking for something I can truly relate to 
 Ann Mitchell Pitman has included numerous pieces of jewelry in her book, from a wide array of designers.  However, the photograpgy does not do the jewelry justice, and the lack of dating for most of the pieces is no help for the beginning collector. With all of the excellent books being published these days for collectors of costume jewelry, this book would not be my first choice.  
 I found this timetable difficult to use.  When the description called it encyclopedic they must have been talking about its size and weight. One might find it informative to just thumb thru and see what was happening in different areas of the world at different time.  But to use the book to trace a particular development (like "movable type," or "domesticated dairy animals,") or to compare progressive periods of history between civilizations (like Central and South America, China, or Egypt) is awkward with lots of bookmarks and notes.  
 This cd is boring. It is not jazz, or even smooth jazz, just instrumental pop music that would work great as background music for an infomercial. If you like monotonous pop, like Celine Dion or Kenneth Gorelick (aka Kenny G), you will probably like this.   I, however, would advise you to look into finding music that isn't so life-less and ordinary 
 "Coping with your Partner's jealousy" had some useful information pertaining to how jealousy is related to childhood and adult traumas and some effective coping strategies for their partners.  What I didn't like about the book is that the assumption the author took is that the partner of the jealous individual has absolutely no role in causing the jealous behavior.  The author flat out states this and presumes that the "target" of jealousy is neither flirtatious, innapropriate or unfaithful, which statistically makes up for high percentage of relationships failing. I think the author may have had some negative experience in her life with a jealous person and is obviously biased in her observations despite her education and experience on the subject 
 I have spent a ton of money learning from the best marketers regarded in the world. This book is laughable in my humble opinion 
 I was asked if Umberto Eco was as much a pompous windbag in Foucault's Pendulum as he was in his other novels and responded:  I would say his novels are aimed squarely at the purveyors of pretension. When I was reading Foucault's Pendulum I got the same "pompous windbag" impression and concluded that I could have photocopied vast sections of the the Necronomican of Abdul Al-Hazred and the Yog-Sothoth just as easily and pasted together my own book by following the Dungeons and Dragons Rule Book. But don't listen to me -- I have never been that impressed with Eco, especially as a novelist -- Hamlet said it best: "Words, Words, Words" or was it "very like a whale"? I suspect Eco was just trying to sound as erudite as Joyce (or at least Professor Irwin Corey). However, Foucault's Pendulum might well be his greatest work since no novel he has written since has been as well received.  I did peek at the sales figures for this novel but they have been suspiciously hidden away in a monastery in the Apennines and the only hint I got was the mention of the bump Eco's sales received with the popularity of The Da Vinci Code. Interestingly, someone asked why Eco didn't sue Brown for plagiarism; a better question might be why the authors of The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail didn't sue Eco ... And the answer of course is, follow the money.  But rest assured, despite having attempted to read this pile and given up in disgust, I will give it a generous rating -- 2 stars. Suffice it to say, however, that Foucault's Pendulum had more in common with The Da Vinci Code than just the arcane historical mystery.  I'll be traveling back to New Jersey next week and will be able to visit the large dent in the wall of my office where the parabolic arc of this novel met with the obstinacy of lath and plaster.  But let's be a little fair about this and realize the Foucault's Pendulum, when compared to the other airport gift-shop thrillers, is certainly adequate to cover the time taken for a trans-oceanic flight, whether it keeps you awake or not. Although if they are showing Raiders of the Lost Ark .. 
  This book was a gift for a friend who reported "Good writing style. Rough content. Sometimes hard to take. Depressing." so I decided not to read it 
 NAT Storage $100?  Read the other reviews, some positive and some negative, and you should be able to get a good idea as to whether to take the plunge.  I have had mine for over a year.  Basically, I tend to ignore it. Copying a file or to, it seems to work more times than not.  Do a mass transfer, and its slow and more than likely going to freeze and require a drastic reset.  Unplug, replug, and reboot PC. Lose access to a partition and you are forced to use a command prompt and perfect syntax.   On a network and want faster and more reliable access, buy yourself a good Western Digital external drive or two.  Hook it up to the machine that runs the most and share access. While its not mirrored, the time it takes to manually sync two external drives is actually time saved

 There are 149 5 star reviews and 92 one star reviews.  This is more representative than an analysis based only on the last 20 reviews. But what is more notable than that is the fact that  the five star reviews tend to recieve a resounding thumbs down from the people who have read them.  Lone Nut Theorists can only bash and discredit their opposition since their story is false.  Posner totally disregards the Parkland Hospital Doctors statements regarding the neck wound as a wound of entry or the massive rear exit wound in the back of the head. He would also have us believe a high powered rifle shot to the head would not cause movement in the direction of the shot. That somehow our body would jerk back in the opposite direction and cause a large entrance wound and a small exit wound contrary to the numerous eyewitness accounts.  To expect us to believe this nonsense is insulting.          
 There are two different ways in which this book may be rated: firstly, from the perspective of its contents, ideas, and accuracy - secondly, from the perspective of being an interesting read. On both accounts, the books scores one star at best.    As far as content is concerned, the main idea of this book revolves around the frustration the author has carried from her teenage years into adulthood in terms of her lack of financial resources to have what other teenagers had. Throughout the first chapters, the author vomits her anger for not being able to have and wear the labels her cool friends had and wore. This can only be described as resentment - she was not making a choice; rather, she could not access what she wanted. The rest of the book is dedicated to criticizing what marketing does, which is undertanding the needs and wants of consumers. From this perspective, we may also argue that businesses are trying to satisfy a demand, and that consumers are willing to pay a premium for having such demands met. However, the author pushes a left-wind agenda and interprets such a marketing approach as "exploiting" consumers. From then on, the books delves into a never ending tirade.    The second perspective this books may be analysed from is one of entertaining value. The books also scores a "fail" - in the pursuit of relent criticism, the topics are analysed in a very boring fashion.    Prospective readers trying to read some sensasionalistic, tabloid-style discourse are better served by getting Noami Klein, of Germaine Greer, or any other left-wing, socialist writer - at least, those authors write more stylish and fashionable nonsensical garbage.    
 I just finished it and my first thought was "What an awful, awful book." I was really excited about reading this one too because the back jacket held such great promise. (i.e. "haunting world of avarice, skullduggery, and exceptional evil." Oh really?? I guess I missed that.) Seems more like an ordinary, even dull, murder story. The main narrator even has to mention that there is exceptional evil afoot. Should he really have to point that out?   As others have mentioned the plot is very convoluted with numerous side stories and people that after the fact seem to contribute nothing to the main story. How many times do I have to read a narrative on King Alfred? At one point yet another person wants to tell Alfred's story and the narrator says he doesn't need to hear it again. My only thought was "Oh thank god!" (I'm still not clear on what this story had to do with the mystery.)   I still don't understand how some of the characters were connected to the murder and what their motivations were. Also, the mystery was wrapped up too nicely w/the Indian boys narration at the end. He basically spelled out exactly what happened. But shouldn't that have been done throughout the book instead of dumping it at the end? (It's like the author got bored and didn't feel like writing anymore. But I don't think we can fault him for that after all the filler he wove into the story that contributed absolutely nothing to the mystery.)   I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I don't think it is particularly brilliant like all of the quotes in the book make it out to be, nor is it well written. 
 While the "facts" in this book are interesting, it is such a difficult read.  How any editor let this book by is beyond me.  You can find out more about our society and the events of this period by visiting a retirement home as compared to reading this book.  Paraphrasing that switches from first to third person and overall rambling makes this a terrible read.  This book reads like a high-school project 
 I bought this book rather in spite of than because of the other Amazon reviews, and lugged it with me on a flight out to the West Coast.  The book lasted from Boston to Atlanta, and when it was over I closed it with a sigh of relief.  While Shermer is certainly at times an engaging writer here he indulges in a rather peculiar form of quantitative psycho-history mixed in with the equally peculiar allocation of behavioural traits to birth order. There MAY be something in this somewhere, but at the same time it smacks of the 19th century Victorian fetish about cranial measurments that Shermer's evident hero-mentor Stephen Gould took to task in THE MISMEASURE OF MAN.  That Shermer is so obsessed with his methodologies (he devotes a substantial portion of the book to 'how he did it") is a shame because it lessens and weakens his focus on his putative topic, the fascinating Alfred Wallace. Instead of really delving intoWallace's background and early experiences we get a few pages of quick gloss intertwined with what frankly struck me as mumbo-jumbo about what it means to be a Younger Child. This may be all very new Age & Hip right now, but I strongly doubt it will prove to have much in the way of scholarly legs. Then there is the tedious re-hashing of Gould's speculations which other reviewers have already re-hashed.  Yup, they are old, they are trite, and can we please now move on?  Perhaps the most interesting part of the book is the discussion of Wallace's involvement with various "Spiritualist" frauds during the second half of his career. Here the writing really picks up & one has the sense that "aha, now we are going to get somewhere". Alas, the excitement soon fades & the book itself fades out to a gentle glow at the end.  i really don't know how to categorize this text.  It is far too incomplete for someone unfamiliar with Wallace's life & work to get a real sense of the man and it offers such an odd view on Wallace's relationships with friends, family, colleagues & rivals that one is left wondering just what was intended.  A footnote to a more general study? Maybe, but i agree with the reviewer who calls for the need of a REAL biography that puts Wallace AND his science in proper context

 This book is pure fiction, nothing more. The problem is that is presented as fact - albeit little known fact.  I won't repeat the good points made by some of the other reviewers, except to say that I also concur with the criticisms of the book.   It makes for difficult reading.  It really is not worth the effort, as you will not have any worthwhile information in the end. In fact, if you are a historian or scholar, stay away from it 
 I bought this book because I wanted to find something that would take my work beyond the standard fair of PowerPoint presentations.  I stumbled upon this book title just before its release and thought by the title that this was exactly what I was looking for.  Advanced techniques would give me a book detailing the cutting-edge of PowerPoint.  Boy was I wrong.  A whole chapter on text placement?  Other chapters detail creating an org chart, creating templates, and using the text tool.  Does that sound like advanced techniques to you?  Sorely disappointed in the book.  My quest goes on for a cutting-edge PowerPoint book 
 I give this book a 1 star not because it wasn't interesting - it certainly was, but because the ending absolutely floored me!  Aghgh**&&*(7#!!!!!  I never thought it was going to end like that - where was the justice??  I feel like something is missing.  I want to reach into the book and smack Alex! Please tell me there is a follow-up book where Sam gets what's coming to him!!! -- Oh, and Daphne too 
 I did not enjoy this book at all.  The protagonist had to be the weakest woman I have ever read about.  I kept reading about her strength and all I saw was a sorry, weak women.  It does not take strength to do what she did but true selfishness.  The character of Rapheal was not developed properly either.  He came across as first angry, then confused, then accepting, then forgiving, she was all over the place with this character.  As for the reviewer who was sick of being hit over the head with what the white man did, in this book its more what the white woman did to save face.  
 and not in a good way; in the BS philosophy way. This movie tries to delve into new activism and the circle of political life, but it goes nowhere and explains nothing. One could say that perhaps the theme of the movie is futility. OK, fair enough, but maybe rearranging furniture is not the best course of action for political and social revolution. Just a thought. Stay away unless you are majoring in liberal arts. 
 This one's easy.  The lies start showing up even in the book description.  "The Zionists established a sovereign Jewish state in 1948. Had they been content with that, peace might have followed the 1967 war, when Israel could have backed the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories."  Actually the Zionists were willing to accept the tiny country that was initially Israel, but the surrounding Arab nations attackeed immediately.  After the 1967 war, Israel offered virtually all the so-called West Bank, but without East Jerusalem, back to Jordan.  They offered Gaza back to Egypt.  They did not offer the Golan Heights back to Syria, because they no longer wanted to be sitting ducks for Syria's artillery.  Israel's offer of the West Bank and Gaza back to Jordan and Egypt was offered at a price: recognition, peace and negotiation.  At the 1967 Arab summit in Kartoum, the Arabs responded to Israel's offer with No, No and No.  Israel had every right at this point to annex the territories won in a defensive war, but under pressure from the U.S. and elsewhere, Israel did not.  After the war, in 1967, there was no talk of a Palestinian state in the territories.  For 19 years Jordan occupied the West Bank, and there was no Arab or Palestinian clamor for a Palestinian state.  For 19 years Egypt occupied Gaza, and there was similar silence.  There was no reason for Israel to talk about yet another Arab state when even the Arabs hadn't talked about it.  The whole idea of a Palestinian state was a concept invented by the surrounding Arab nations to make war against Israel by a new method: public relations.  If they could make the world believe that Israel was an occupier of lands not theirs, they hoped world opinion could defeat Israel where Arab armies could not.  Nevertheless, in 1973 the Arab nations tried yet again, but were trounced, and the war by public relations started to ramp up.  In my opinion, Neuman's solution, "The only solution is for Israel to withdraw, unilaterally, to its 1948 borders.", shows real impoverishment of thought.  For almost 60 years the Middle East's Arab and Muslim nations have been trying, unsuccessfully, to destroy a nation that was recognized by the United Nations and which was purchased totally and legitimately from recognized landowners, but it is Israel which must surrender?  At the time of Israel's creation, Arabs who were residents and who had not decided to flee (at the request of the attacking Arab nations) were to be given full political rights, unlike, for example, Jordan (Transjordan at the time), in which Jews were not allowed to live.  In fact, although there is racism on the part of individuals in Israel, Israel itself is not a racist state.  It is the surrounding Muslim and Arab nations who are the racists.  In my opinion, Neumann's book, even if you consider only its Book Description, is trash in the spirit of the anti-Semitc Czarist forgery, Protocols of the Elders of Zion 
  I heard a radio commentator highly recommend this book.   She said that it took place in Boston, gave loads of information about the city and about the real estate business.   Well, the information on both is sketchy at best.  This book is an easy read for a rainy afternoon.  I was a bit disappointed however.  I thought that it would be more substantial.  
 I WOULDN'T KNOW I NEVER GOT MY CD AND ITS BEEN OVER TWO MONTH 
 In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.  from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as  a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.  everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.  it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses.  
 I hate how this book protrays the father, as an unattached lion who watches tv rather than helping his son bloom. I bought this book for my autistic son for Christmas, read it and put it in the trash. It makes Dads look uninvolved and is not a good portrayal at all. My husband is an excellent father and certianly would not choose to watch tv over helping my son learn.  Very dissapointed in this book and honestly surprised by all these positive comments 
 I know the book is aimed at "young adults" but I cannot help pointing out that over 100 pages of psycho-babble with a "see the end from 20 miles away" style is just horrible to read! If you have actually read 1984 then leave this "book" alone 
 The instructions say that it is easy set-up. However, it is very difficult to get the poles into the correct place to set the tent up. Without forcing too much, the tent tore 
 This book is very hard to read, the concepts and arguements are not difficult to understand but are very one sided.  May questions are raised, but the author does not provide any answers.  This book needs a makeover  starting with triming some of the long-winded areas and adding some  opposing veiw pionts 
 couldnt get into this one , and i am a fan. disappointment 
 Mr. Leahy is a very talented reporter, but his interesting, carefully collected raw material is poisoned by his obvious agenda, which is to make the case that Michael Jordan is a terribly flawed man who never truly deserved the admiration of his fans.  By the end of the book, Mr. Leahy's perspective just seems childish.  He is forever blaming others for telling part of the truth, but concealing the rest--yet that is precisely what he does throughout the book.  Certainly, Jordan had his faults as a teammate and as an employee, but what about the admirable features of his "last comeback"?  What other fading sports star tried to turn around a miserable franchise?  What other fading sports star remained one of the best players in the world at 39 years old, even though his performance was limited by a serious knee injury?  What other sports legend risked spoiling an absolutely PERFECT conclusion to a brilliant career just because he loved the game and wasn't ready to give it up forever?  Jordan took on an extraordinary challenge and didn't succeed.  That may seem pathetic and selfish to Mr. Leahy, but I don't see why readers should view Jordan's struggles as a Wizard in that way. 
 This is, as one can guess by the title, an academic book. Obviously it is; it is difficult to say, even after reading it, what exactly it means. Does it refer to "cultures" created by U.S. Imperialism? Or perhaps to  "cultures" created within the U.S. by imperialism? The  predictable answer would be "both," an answer that seems to be  given by the structure of the book itself, which not only includes essays  on the impact of U.S. imperialism on other nations but also essays on the  impact of imperialism "on-shore," so to speak. One such essay is  by a professor named Bill Brown, who writes on, apparently, the  relationship between the Panama Canal and artificial limbs in "The  Prosthetics of Empire." This, to a non-academic, might sound  surprising, but it is if anything rather banal these days. But what is  really interesting about Brown's essay is that, while he seems to be  well-within the crypto-Marxian, post-everything critical theory mish-mash  of what passes for academic thought these days, he has actually, in a  somewhat weird way, entirely transcended those boundaries. How, you might  ask? Well, the answer seems to be that Brown has taken the bold step of not  merely just making assertions, as critical theory types are wont to do, but  he has even dispensed with that old-fashioned technique of the bourgeois  class, and written an essay that does not just merely gesticulate at  argumentation but has left argumentation behind entirely. What I mean is,  Brown doesn't just say that there is a connection between artificial limbs  and the Panama Canal and be done with it; instead he just proceeds as if  there was a connection. This, you might say, is a stunning achievement, and  one has to praise not just Brown, but also his editors for their courage in  publishing it. Of course, not all of the essays in this volume are this  "edgy," but don't be surprised next year when you find used  bookstores awash with it. By then, of course, the work of Brown and his  compatriots will have been denounced as just another victims of cooptation  by the "hegemonic state.&quot 
 This is so small it barely fits a quarter stick of butter. Rip of 
 .....isn't that someplace in Florida?  It would be interesting to see what old VW would have made of that section of the planet had she decided to incorporate it into her novel.  She was, however, a member of a clique which chose to incarcerate itself in the English Cotswolds for the main part.  Ah, wait...I feel an analogy coming on.....nope, it's gone!  There's nothing amazing about 'Orlando' it was a vehicle for Heaven knows what hang-up Woolf was pretending to endure at the time.  No one in that era wrote for entertainment or pleasure, it was always to make some point or other.  Thankfully the 'real' focus of most of these idle rants are lost in the mists of time.  It does, however, contain some cute imagery; the bit where the River Thames suddenly becomes unfrozen is good....I regard the presumed ancestors of Michael Winner hosting the mass banquet condemned to a watery eternity sans iceberg as semi-historic.    All in all, this tome should be read and sneered at .... like all  such books.  One shouldn't focus on the overall plot but the few mini-gems sparsely scattered throughout the text 
 If you are looking for a textbook you can use to learn statistical methods, this is not the one. The book is most useful for scientists experienced in applying the methods of statistics, who want to sharpen their mathematical apparatus to put their research on a firm foundation. The level of mathematical knowledge required to read the book is not very high but quite demanding as in many cases lots of intermediary calculations are left to the reader, so to properly read the book you have to have a pen and paper to follow the derivation of formulae 
 Maybe if I was in a exo-biology class or some other acedemic pursuit, it would have held a little more merit. But as a casual reader, it was DRY and uninteresting. I couldn't even force myself through the first chapter, I was falling asleep. boring. get Ascent of Wonder instead! 
 The vendors never sent me the CD...I am very disappointed with the service this time through amazon.  
 I bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs. Unless you have a changing station (or crib, wherever you want to hang it) that has slits or slots able to hold it - the velcro will NOT hold it well. And the "shelves" are a bit insecure. It's a great idea, but just didn't pan out.  
 As someone who was bullied growing up and who now has children in school, I was eager to read this book. But I was disappointed and in some ways disgusted. Perhaps part of that is my own fault -- my expectations held all the way to the end that I would get some insight, just some little peak into why bullying happens, whether it can be stopped, what adults can do to stop it or negate its effects. Anything useful. I also grew up with the attitude that kids (and adults) shouldn't be bullying each other, period. They shouldn't be obsessed with popularity, wealth, beauty, social climbing. Just let me be me and stop laughing at me, and I'll let you be you and treat you with equal respect. Well, Jodee isn't coming from that perspective. Her entire book is a rant based on the assumption that she should have been popular among her peers and that cruel kids and cruel fate robbed her of this right -- the right to be one of the other bullies! And how does she deal with it? By becoming a narcissist for life and writing a book bragging about how she now hobnobs with celebrities -- while taking her jabs at her peers who didn't give her the status she felt she deserved. I'm sorry, but I cannot relate to that at all. It is disgusting and pathetic, and an injustice to see this recommended by so many people. How does this help kids? It tells them that they can be popular too if they fight, scratch, complain their way to the "top" of something, and write a book to say "see, I told you I should have been popular! Nyah!" If I could give this book a zero or negative stars, I would have 
 There is nothing particularly noteworthy about this book.  Many of the pictures are reversed negatives, making the shells "sinistral," or reversed...a big oversight to shell collectors worth their weight in salt.  Many of the specimens are ordinary, not intrinsically special in form or in color.  It is as if the photographer simply took fairly nice photos of whatever happened to be at hand -- which is not acceptable. Where is Oliva porphyria?  Conus dalli?  (color/pattern)  Malea ringens?  Stellaria solaris? (form)  My mind nearly boggles with the missed opportunities here!  There are so many other existing shell books that are superior to this (The Shell, Abott, 1968, well worth owning, being a classic of the type) that I am speechless as to why this one was published.  Compared to what could have been it adds very little indeed, and is not worth owning.  
 What a waste of time.  This book is good for one thing.  It reminded of something I need to work on.  My stubbornness.  Sometimes I can be just too stubborn for my own good.  When I was reading this I just wouldn't quit and had to go all the way to the end.  This will teach me.  Thank you Mr. Baldacci!  Here is a synopsis of the book:  "A" is the biggest strongest man in the world.  No way!  "B" is the biggest strongest.  How can they be if "C" was in the most awesome group of men in the world?  Then they try to catch a bad guy who thinks he is the biggest, strongest and smartest of them all.  Thank you again David!  This would have received a 1 star except I was reminded of the lesson I needed 
 This is cute- but, it's not as good as Brown Bear. The words don't just roll off your tongue like Brown Bear. I don't find it as "catchy". 
 When I received the flashlight it was broken  I have tried to contact Mark Golden in Delray, Florida, the place the flashlight was sent from, and have heard nothing back this week 
 I PURCHASED THE Z5 FOR A WEEKEND HOME SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. MACHINE IS HARDLY USED.  MADE LUKEWARM COFFEE AND SLIGHTLY WARM MILK AND GENERALLY WAS A LEMON.  FINALLY RETURNED MACHINE AT MY PACKING EXPENSE TO THE COMPANY WHO RETURNED IT IN 4 DIFFERENT PIECES.  IT WAS COMPLETELY BROKEN.  THE BEST THAT THEY WILL DO IS SEND ANOTHER CUSTOMER'S REFURBISHED MACHINE IN EXCHANGE FOR THEM BREAKING THE MACHINE.  THIS SITUATION IS SO OUTRAGEOUS THAT IT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE.  MANY PEOPLE PAY LESS THAN $3200. FOR AN AUTOMOBILE(USED) AND GET BETTER SERVICE.  BUYER BEWARE.  THEIR EXCUSE WAS THAT THE MACHINE WAS 6 MONTHS OLD(BUT USED ONLY 10 TIMES).  I AM COMPLETELY DISSATISFIED WITH THE MACHINE AND THE COMPANY.  THEY WERE VERY RUDE AS WELL. HOPEFULLY AMAZON WILL BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING BUT IT SHOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN TO THAT POINT 
 If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version 
 Nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst, and how dare him to diss KRS-one, he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on Number 1, he just added to why he sucks. Lets face it, all his songs are basically dumb and and really don,t have much texture involved. And how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable. If you buy this album, you throw away good money. Unless you like bubblegum rap. This is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool, but lets face it ,its played out 
 This book focuses on Amanda Starkey, a young nurse who has suffered a breakdown and was sent home by her boss so she could get her act together. Amanda returns to her family home in Wisconsin to live with her sister, Mattie, and Mattie's daughter, Ruth. Mattie's husband, Carl, is off fighting in France during WWI.  The sisters are very close, and so Mattie is of course thrilled to have her sister back in her life on a daily basis again. They begin to embark on a new aspect of their life together, while Mattie anxiously waits for her husband's return from the war.  Then, one winter night, tragedy strikes, and Mattie ends up drowning in the nearby lake. Her young daughter, Ruth, almost ends up drowning as well, but is rescued in the nick of time.   Not long after Mattie's death, Carl returns from the war, wounded. He is eager to see his wife, not realizing that she has died.   Amanda, who has never liked Carl, hopes that he will decide to leave again almost as soon as he'd returned home. She figures him for the sort to not want to raise a child alone, and each day waits for him to leave, thereby making her Ruth's sole caretaker. Yet much to her annoyance, he manages to get his bearings again and remains a fixture in both hers and Ruth's life.  At the same time, Amanda struggles with inner demons, both because of what happened to her sister, and because of what happened in her life prior to returning home, which you eventually learn about. She is then sent to a sanatorium and Carl is left to care for his daughter on his own. However, he founders, and ends up relying on a second cousin (Hilda) for her grudging help.   This new upheaval causes Ruth to regress a great deal, and she stops talking and acts out by breaking things in the house and being impossible to toilet train and deal with overall. In a funny turn of events, Ruth manages to embarrass Hilda enough so that she leaves. Carl, in an act of desperation, takes Ruth with him on one of his many visits to see Amanda, in the hope that it will spark a desire in her to get well once and for all. It works, and a year after having been committed, Amanda returns home.  The rest of the story vacillates between what really happened the night Mattie drowned, and what is happening in Amanda and Ruth's life afterwards. In the first part of the book, Ruth ages from about 3-5. When the second part begins, she is already 11. I felt that was somewhat abrupt, and it took me a few pages to realize how much time had passed, as there wasn't anything to indicate that this had happened.   The book continued to bounce around a lot from this point on, between reminiscences of the past and what was actually happening to the characters months or years down the line. It got a little annoying at times to have to figure out where exactly the next installation was starting out. Also, the book jacket said the story was told from several of the main character's points of view, but the only ones you really hear from are Ruth and Amanda.   I was pretty disappointed by the end of the story. The book starts out intriguing and makes you wonder if Amanda literally went off the deep end after all and killed her sister, or if it was in fact an accidental drowning. But by about halfway through, the facts become clear and are easy to interpret. Still, I hoped maybe I was wrong and the ending would surprise me after all. It didn't.  Carl also disappears about halfway through the book. It's due to a job he takes, but it felt like he was written out of the story because the author ran out of use for him, or wasn't sure what to do with him after a certain point. She spent a lot of time focusing on Carl's desire to learn about the truth of his wife's death.   As it was, he only found out part of the truth, and that was according to what Amanda got him to believe. Nevertheless, Carl accepted it at face value and after that he accepted his wife's fate. He was then written out of the story. I didn't really like that aspect of things and didn't think it meshed with everything else that was happening. Even though he wasn't a strong character in general, he's one of the characters I actually liked. Amanda wasn't that likeable at all, and was a pretty cold person who was obsessed with Ruth and still obsessed with the past. Ruth was somewhat pliable and easily molded to her aunt's bidding, even though she made some feeble attempts to be her own person.  I don't know if I'd read this author again. But I managed to find this book for $1.. and would say it was worth it and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it, either on here or in a bookstore 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 After reading this book I wasn't sure what was the purpose of writing it. Paula keeps repeating herself and doesn't really say anything new, nothing you would expect to hear from someone who claims to be so close to celebrities and know their nature so well. I had no idea that writing for "Page six" is such a big deal and quite frankly still don't think it will affect the world that much.  This book is just another version of "People" magazine, except it costs more. Save your money, don't buy this book. 
 The Bourne Identity by this author was great but this is a contrived, monumental bore.  Intricate plotting is only worth following if the themes and characters are worthy of attention.  This book is some kind of desperately single-minded, looney-left hate fest.  OK, you can say Hoover was a monster, and say it again 10 times, maybe even 50 or 60 times, but that does not a book make.  The world presented here is sick, but the sickness is the author's monomania 
 I have not yet received the DVD, and I contacted the customer's service last month. They sent me a new shipment, but I am still waiting for it 
 I have always been a prolific reader and rarely do I come across a book for which I can find no value, no redeeming qualities. But I must extend a hearty congratulations to Julia Barrett for writing the most astounding piece of horse excrement I have ever had the misfourtune to purchace. Teachiing my cat to walk repeatedly over my keyboard would produce a work of more sense. If you are like me and just have to read it - just because you're obsessed with Austen - Buy it used for 45 cents and then burn it 
 We are a group of fourth graders from Mrs. Larson's class at Sunset Hill School in Lawrence, Kansas. Most of us thought parts of this book were boring. We thought the ending did not close out the story well. We felt there was something else going on in the story that the author didn't tell  us. The illustrations did not stand out and were difficult to understand.  If you looked at the illustrations they would not make you want to read the  book because they looked so sad. We also didn't like the story because the  characters had too much anger. We also thought the story should have a  happy ending. As it was it felt like the author had just stopped in the  middle of the story. Some people might enjoy this book but we didn't 
 This book reads well, but is more aimed toward the casual observer, not for mountaineers.   Ed has done Everest many times without oxyygen as a guide too 
 The second CD was scratched and hence I cannot play it. I would appreciate it if you would send me another one and also include the information needed to return the damaged one sent to me.  Thanks.  Jeann 
 I was very disappointed in this book as the review I read led me to believe that it would contain all kinds of helpful hints on ingredient sources and substitutions, equipment, etc.  There were some old standards missing and not too many exciting new recipes.  I will probably put this volume in the donation box 
 Here's another Italian cannibal movie and I continue to find there isn't much exciting about this genre.  Again, we have mostly controversy over killing animals which I really don't find either disturbing or entertaining at all.  I am also a little bored at seeing Kerman in another movie.    There really was one scene where they could have taken the movie 'too far' but they held back.  I was hoping they would take things too far.  
 Jim Hightower needs to quit stabbing people in the back. That is not how you solve America's problems. Another piece of pure fiction from a Michael Moore wannabee.  
 After looking at the third edition, I ordered this book for a class that I teach. The fourth edition contains many changes, all of them for the worse. The literary selections in the 4th edition are not as well chosen; the added paragraphs in the chapters on New Criticism and feminism are stylistically awkward and often confusing and repetitive, not to mention factually questionable (the claim that there were no voices in feminism between Pisan and Wollstonecraft!). Most distressing of all, this edition was apparently rushed to press in time for classes in fall 2006, for it contains typos about every five or six pages. The chapter on feminism alone has at least ten errors, e.g., "one in the same," "least" instead of "lest" (that mistake was carried over from the third edition), "lastest"!!!, inconsistency in verb number after "a variety of [plural nouns]," etc. The publisher should send an apology to all purchasers of this book, along with a list of errata. On the bright side: I tell my students that I can't penalize them too much for small errors, when the textbook contains so many 
 I remember when Burroughs did an interview with Jerry Casale. And Casale spoke of midwestern misanthropy and the sense of shame about being a human. Well, in this diary, Burroughs gave full voice to his midwestern curmudgeon persona.   I almost croaked when I came across the following passage: "I must tell James: Please never conceal from me any nasty letters or reviews. I want the names of these creeps. The addresses, so I can put one of my curses on them. It will give me something to do. And jog a few higher-up elbows hiding behind the nameless a--holes. I will make a list and cross names off one after another. Like the new rich in St. Louis. At his daughter's coming-out party. Nobody showed. She went mad. He made a list of all the invitees who didn't show. And ruined them one after another. It gave meaning to his life. He crossed off the last name on his deathbed, gave a contented belch and died. He was a fully fulfilled evil old man."  The anti-drug-prohibition rants are tedious enough. But what's surprising is that he begrudges atheists just for being atheists. As if their mere existence was a personal insult to his non-denominational theistic yearnings: "I believe in God. Not omnipotent. He needs help now."  The cat-sentimentality is pretty icky. Burroughs ended up valuing humans only insofar as they're capable of being caretakers of cats: "If a plague should or will kill a third of the population, I can only pray that it affects not only humans but domestic animals, with special reference to dogs and cats. The picture of trillions of dispossessed cats is too horrible to be confronted. 
 I hate these new taller books.  Supposedly they are easier to read....actually they are just more money for the publishers.  The reason I buy paperbacks is because they are less expensive.  Then the publishers all got together and decided to shaft the paperback customer by offering some releases only in the taller size for 2 dollars more.  I read 3 books a week, so I can't afford to waste money for a larger book with the same story.  Does it add anything to the book?  No, just more cost.   I refuse to buy this book on principle.  Maybe if my library has the hardcover I will borrow it from them, but I refuse to put more money in the publishers' coffers when they aren't offering this in the normal paperback size.  If it was really for the reader's benefit that they offer the larger size, they would offer both sizes to better serve the consumer. I have seen only the taller book in every store I have visited, there is no regular paperback of this story.  
 Jones certainly did his homework, but the work comes across as mean, even vindictive.  He shows Kinsey is the harshest light and he comes across as excessively judgmental.  A more recent book, Sex - the Measure of All Things by Jonathan Gathorne Hardy is a kindler and more balanced look at Kinsey and his work.  I recommend starting with that. Kinsey was a great pioneer -- not perfect -- but a true giant in opening up to the doors to our sexuality.  The Christian right has spent the last thirty years trying to discredit Kinsey's work and take us back to the 19th Century 
 I bought the mission file cart to go with a mission side table, bookshelf, and coffee table. It does not match the other three in look or in build quality. It's even a different color. It was harder to assemble than the other pieces, especially the file drawer. For a printer table, I would recommend the sturdier side table instead 
 Why? Because this book says nothing more than what he had already said in A Brief History of Time. However, I will say that unlike A Brief history of time, this one is a really, really big book with lots of colorful pictures so that they can charge an extra 30 dollars. And that he also changed the titles of the chapters. That's something...and the pictures were pretty!   Believe it or not after I read Universe in a Nutshell I decided to give good ol' Steve one more shot so I picked up A Theory of Everything. However, to my surprise, within those pages I didn't find a theory of everything...but I did find somehting that amazed me more than a theory of everything every could...Inside, I found A Brief History of Time! He had fooled me again!  It's a conspiracy, this man is publishing the same book over & over again with different titles to fool people into buying them. And he's including illustrations now because he discovered how well worthless pictures sell! Don't buy into it! It's a trick, underneath the new dustjacket, pretty pictures, and new chapter headings, these are same words!  I proclaim myself to be the first to say "I will not be fooled by Mr. Hawking again. 
 It's a great concept, but my unit wasn't recognized by any of my 3 PC's, despite hours of work with tech support and even trying a second unit. One of my PCs runs XP (they had no idea why this computer didn't recognize the Magpix) and the others run Win98 (which they said sometimes has problems with the Magpix, although they don't say that in their marketing literature). They gave me my money back, but refused to refund the shipping charge as promised, and in addition I wasted several hours and the cost of mailing two units back to them. I suggest waiting for the next version, or even better, for a better company to introduce a similar product 
 Unfortunately Kockelman's book turned out to be a encyclopedic summary of Husserlian phenomenology, and as such much poorer and less illuminative than the Brittanica article of Husserl's which was similar in aim, and which is the movement point for this book. Students of some intelligence need books that are really engaging and developing, and not just encyclopedic knowledge. Of course by reading this sort of a book we may learn definitions of concepts like noema and noemata, but I believe we would better have no idea of a subject than having a junk of poor and lifeless concepts. I would recommend the reader, especially the more sophisticated and good-willed one, to turn to Husserl's own numerous introductions like Cartesian Meditations or the Crisis even if he does not know much phenomenology, and put some sweat into them. Still this book might be helpful with some undergraduate exams- to'fill in' papers 
 Too much wrong information in the text. Photo captions = hit or miss.  Altogether: unreliable. Take your needs elsewhere 
 This book is a more a of brief review of table saw technique and jigs. The chapters are not very detailed and don't actually contain any directions for doing most of cuts or processes. The most frustrating thing is where he will say "just use this very handy jig" and then gives a very crude drawing of the jig with no explanation of how to build it or even a basic layout. A MUCH better book is Kelly Mehler's The Table Saw Book 
 This books is fraught with errors that will drive you crazy if you're trying to learn Flash for the first time. It's a great example of what happens when a book needs to get to press before it's been thoroughly edited. I'm actually on Amazon.com to get another Flash 5 tutorial book to replace this monument to bad editing. In a word... don't waste your money. : 
 As advertised on the cover of this book, anachronistic me-generation guru Peck and his wife Lily set off on a tour of Britain's legendary stone circles, right? Wrong. Peck and Lily do visit some circle sites but this book is about 1% stone circles and 99% Peck going on and on and on and on and on and on about himself, his life, his beliefs, his personal health, and why faithful Lily forgave him for all the pain his freewheeling, skirtchasing lifestyle as one of the "it" crowd of the '60's and '70's self-discovery movement caused her. This is not about Britain's heritage sites, or even about self-help, it's about Peck patting Peck on the back for being such a smart fella. A bad book without any redeeming qualities. A waste of money and time. Oh, and Dr. Peck, Scotland is not, as you claim, "larger than all the rest of the United Kingdom combined." Jeesh 
 I bought this because the reviews for another, earlier version, the Korean import DVD, bemoaned that one's poor picture quality.  When this one became available, I hoped it was a legitimate and faithful DVD.  But this one looks terrible too.  I see I am not the only person still waiting for a clean restored print on DVD, one worthy of both the original and of today's technological capacity to render it in all its beauty and glory 
 First, I will confess that this is the first time I have bought one of Dozois "best of" books new rather than used.  I have never considered his collections worth paying full price, but amongst the dross I have always found two or three real gems that was I glad to discover.  I have come to conclude these gems must have been included by complete accident.  When I saw "Best of the Best", I assumed that he had decided to put out a book spanning several years, using gems only, skipping the filler.  Well, I was wrong, and feel cheated out of the price of this book!  I slogged through page after page of stories ranging from mediocre to poor, with nary a gem in sight.  I understand that Dozios did not actually write these stories, and therefore did not create the turgid prose, sloppy plotting, hackneyed and pedestrian themes, and uninteresting characters that fill these stories.  He is, however, responsible for choosing them and holding them up to the public as the "best" examples of a genre that has so much more to offer than a reader unfamiliar with science fiction might conclude it does based upon this book 
 This is a HUGE mistake in buying this issue.  Wait until the reviese edition comes in, there are too many mistakes throughout the book.  Its fustrating not being able to finish most of the excercises because of typos or left out information 
 This book was not enjoyed by either of my children.  It is so ridiculous that children in the age range for whom its written think its stupid, and the young ones who tolerate witless nonsense don't understand the meaning of the words.  I have an eleven year old and a four year old, both of which were bored by the second page.  The word search within words is a great concept, but I expected there to be some sense about it, so the kids could be entertained AND challenged by the text.  I am very disappointed 
 1st, let me say that I LOVE (LOVE!!!!) the JLU seasons...and, I was VERY excited when I found out that these episodes were coming to DVD.  To my great disappointment, I found that Disc 3 (the one with Aquaman on the cover of the disc) would not play in ANY of my DVD players, including my computer DVD player.  I returned the item to Amazon, and Amazon replaced it in a flash.  Again, Disc 3 would not play in my computer DVD player, and it took several times of ejecting and reinserting the DVD into my standard DVD player to even start the disc.  I returned (sadly) the item again to Amazon who said that they have been experiencing numerous problems with this DVD edition.  So, sadly my wait continues....buyer beware.  I can understand a problem with one disc from one order...but to experience the SAME problem with the SAME disc from two different orders...that to me spells defective disc for all.  Anyone else out there have a problem with Disc 3 not playing??? 
 I've loved Jeanne Ray's other books (Julie & Romeo, Step Ball Change, and Eat Cake). I found them all to be well written, funny and entertaining reads, with varied and likeable characters. This book doesn't come close to meeting the standard set by the others. It isn't funny at all. All of the characters act horribly, including the martyred Julie who lets everyone in her family walk all over her. I haven't read a book in a long time where I didn't like a single character. (And I liked these people in the first book - Julie and Romeo). I highly recommend her other books, but I'd stay away from this one 
 The larger of the bowls was broken when I recieved it so it was not packet very well. I have used the smaller bowl and loved it. 
 I unfortunately wound up seeing this Christmas Misgiving on its original airing.  I have always been a fan of any Christmas special since Rudolph hit the air way back when. Each holiday season I hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the "New Rudolph".  This is so far away from that you would need the Hubble Space scope in order to see how close it came.  The imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise. Regrettably the story makes Santa vs. the Martins look like an Oscar contender.  Such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3D gimmickry.  You can't improve on failure. After it aired on TV I didn't see it return in later years on regular TV. I didn't miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely.  Can't win them all 
 This thing just does not get hot enough so what you're supposed to be grilling gets steamed instead.  Not very appetizin 
 As many people may know by now, Sony was recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased CD (Van Zant: Get Right With The Man) from Sony music not only installed DRM software (digital rights management, to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain devices), but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from Windows, and opened the system up to security issues such as viruses.  This CD has the same copyright protection, called XCP. When installed, Sony hijacks your computer and installs custom software which:  1) Hides itself entirely from Windows by installing as a rootkit 2) Hides itself in such a manner that any files begining with $sys$ are also hidden. For example, if you install the XCP copy protection software on your machine, and rename "document.doc" to "$sys$document.doc" it then becomes invivisble to you forever. 3) Installs its own custom CD-Rom drivers to hijack your system. It also sneakily names these drivers "Plug and Play Device Manager" to seem as if it's a part of Windows. Trying to delete these drivers manually will disable your CD-Rom drive entirely. 4) Offers no uninstall option until you manually contact Sony  As of my writing this review, Sony has "apologized" for this incident, and claims they will "re-evaluate" this copyright protection software on their CDs in the future.  In the meantime, a virus is currently running wild, which names itself begining with $sys$ in an attempt to hide from the user and virus scanners.  Several class action lawsuits are also pending against Sony right now.  In summary, as you can tell from above, Sony's actions here are absolutely horrible. This is your music. You purchased it, and they should not have any right to dictate how you can use it, let alone install software which compromises your system security.  This is one of the CDs with Sony's XCP copyright protection software on it, and as a result, you should not buy it to send a message to Sony that this will NOT be tolerated in the future 
 Am I the only one who in reading the reflections section began to feel that I had dropped in on the last days of the semester of a political science class and was therefore somewhat lost by many of the references? I actually majored in political science as an undergrad, but that was 20 some years ago. I don't remember what it means when you say Hegelian. And the fact that I remember studying Hegel puts me a slight advantage over let's say, biology majors. A sentence or two defining his terms would have helped a lot. I ended up just putting the book down with only 10-15 pages left. I never do that.  So, while parts of the reflection section were over my head, the insipid celebrity chasing of the bulk of the book was so condescending. Did Levy or the editors feel that we need to read about famous people, otherwise we are bored? In fact, it is the opposite. I really don't care that Woody Allen likes to play clarinet. He didn't tell us what we don't already know about these people. Or what we care about.  
 This book really is a basic introduction to Lee Enfield rifles.  After ordering books from Charles R Stratton and Ian Skennerton I found Alan Petrillo's book lacking in detail.  I was able to learn more about the Lee Enfield rifle by surfing the web while I was waiting for this book to arrive.  My suggestion is don't waste your money on this book 
 But I'm just very frustrated in the comparisons between Saddam and Osama.  Though Darryl doesn't mention the relation, he released this on the eve of the Iraq war, and "this war" refers to Iraq--and I've never met anyone, ANYONE, who said "Awww, forget 'bin Laden!"  This song is about Saddam.  But though Saddam was (is) nuts, he wasn't stupid.  He wanted to keep his power, not do dumb stuff to rile up outsiders.  Al Qaeda in Iraq didn't really even exist before the invasion, and now they are a strong force there.  I feel the invasion has TAKEN AWAY from the real fight on terrorism--we're so bogged down there, we can't put our full efforts into thwarting terror plots and encouraging moderates to be on our side--there is a PR campaign to be fought, folks--you can't (well, I guess you CAN) just bomb everything in sight.  Most of our enemies in Iraq (even 'Al Qaeda' there) don't give two craps about Osama (btw I first wrote Saddam there--it does get confusing!), they just feel their country was invaded--kind of like how the Michigan Militia would react here.  The admistration disrupted the world and divided our nation.  United we stand, indeed.    And though I haven't listened to the album, this has exactly FOUR new songs.  Tell me that's not opportunism.  So no, Darryl, I have not forgotten the day when I saw thousands die when our two towers were destroyed, but I'm afraid you have, in the way you've replaced Osama bin Laden with Saddam Hussein 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity. 
  I did not like this book, talk about dysfunctional families. I thought it might be like the old fashioned traditional stories that I'm used to reading. The stories were not even feel good stories of christmas,I would suggest something like christmas in my heart if you want a good old fashioned christmas story, you won't be let down 
 I like Evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs, and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli relationship, sustained through 12 books so far, being a case in point. But Full Scoop was actually a trial to get through. I could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted Evanovich's comedic rhythm. The whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what I have come to expect from Evanovich. The silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent, leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened? The least forgivable of the sins committed in Full Scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between Maggie and Zack. None at all. So it's hard to label the book: a sort of but not really romance, an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger.... maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller 
 The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.  Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.  This CD totally KILLS that.  First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.  And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!  While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
 My mother in-law was actually responsible for Billy Milligan while he was in the Athens State hospital in Ohio.  I've had a chance to read this book, and although very good, what my mother-in-law tells me is much, much different.   She cared for him during his entire stay there.  She said that he had more psychology and parapsychology books in his room than she could have ever imagined.  She also said that his IQ was off the charts.  She believes (and she has a doctorate in psychology) he only has FOUR distinct personalities.  Raven being one of them.  Billy had the abilitiy and knowledge to manipulate his condition, making it appear much more severe.   Of course, she can't write anything about this, because Billy's publicist made everyone caring for him sign a waiver saying they wouldn't.  Yes... Billy Milligan has a publicist.   He also was a millionaire (because he exploited his disease) and drove a corvette on the weekends they let him go home.... yep... they let Billy Milligan have weekends.  This book is a very good interpretaion on what could possibly been going on in Billy's head.  However, after talking with someone who was actually there, and knew him well.... makes me second guess the validity of it 
 It's well known that 'Showgirls' flopped. I remember director Paul Verhoeven getting an award for having produced something like 'the worst movie of the year'.  It's not hard to point out its failure: the young & attractive lead Elizabeth Berkley cannot act. As Elizabeth is in focus quite a lot, her frequent appearance turns 'Showgirls' into disaster.  In hindsight it's incredible that an experienced director like Paul Verhoeven hired someone like her. I guess the blatant display of nudity in Berkley's role, as well as in this whole movie, made better actresses look elsewhere. The more so, while 'Showgirls' theme and plot are somewhat meagre.  One star for the effort, and another for the nice picturing. Any lavish display of female nudity cannot cover the failure of 'Showgirls' concept 
 i almost broke up with my girlfriend for picking out this movie at blockbuster. i cant even put into words how bad this movie was, i really wonder what the people who made this were thinking 
 It's a classic I know, but I just couldn't follow the country dialouge. Seeing the movie, the story itself is good. But in the book it is soo hard to understand and doesn't.....flow. Maybe it is just me? It's a classic, but I didn't like it. I recomend the book 
 It's about a young man who lives in Mississippi town with his mentally ill aunt. His cousin (not his aunt's daughter) is in love with him and they do (or did) have a sexual relationship. Here come Lee Todd into town and wants to rent his cottage. There is homosexual tension between the two of them but neither acknowledges it.  A snarky side of me wants to call this "Brokeback Swamp" but this film is more Southern Gothic and a B film at best. It's slow moving and nothing much happens. Avoid this film.  
 I've been running marathons for about 10 years now and never focused my training on diet. I picked up this book in the hopes on finding tips about dieting for runners, but obviously, this book is for walkers, runners. I'm running anywhere between 70 to 100 miles a week and this book is clearly for runners averaging about 15 miles a week. Good book if you're in that camp 
 If I had read this before the 2000 election. I would have learned that Americans want a leader that posseses honesty, compassion, morals, and the courage of his convictions. I should have at least pretended to posses some of these qualities. Bush stole Florida in 2000 and Ohio in '04, if you don't believe me just ask John Kerry. And where did I come up with that stupid imaginary lockbox stuff anyway 
 I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.  
 For those who like mysteries but profer light reading the Pennsylvania Dutch Mysteries should suit them just fine. But to any one who takes their mysteries seriously these books are a joke. This one is no exception. If you want a good belly laugh at how rediculous things can get read on, otherwise go do something else 
 While Micheal White's book does serve as an interesting introduction to some of the biographical history of the iconoclastic Leonardo, White includes so much subjective narrative following up the context of each chapter that he turns the "total man" goal of his study into a hyperbolic and titillating read that could very well have been lifted from the "Milanese Inquirer", if such a tabloidic rag existed so  long ago!  Hey, it probably did!  But do we have to pay [money] for a ... Italian rag?  All right, I'm no writer, but I would hate to have read this book as cliff note version for class and then had my semester grade riding on the final exam.  If this is what you're thinking, don't do it!  Leonardo would thank you if he could.. 
 I got this as a present about two years ago, and I have had mixed feelings.  I like it, but I get really frustrated because the program is buggy.  I cannot create a standalone executable, and the program has random bugs.  Also, it is very hard to create proffesional-type games.  Be aware that the machine you run standalone programs on has to have a video card, regardless of whether you use it or not.  In conclusion, good idea, but very buggy 
 I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale.  Please Dean, take an opportunity to read some 'how-to' books on writing 
 This waterer is a great concept, but does have some drawbacks.  For starters, one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work.  The first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it.  The other dog is just fine with it, but then again he's deaf, so the gurgle doesn't bother him. lol. The other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls, it gets dirty.  so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl, but it's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off, clean the bowl and but the jug back on.  So, if your dog isn't afraid of the noise it makes and you don't mind the extra hassle cleaning it, it's great.  Otherwise, just get a large bowl; that's what i ended up having to do 
 FOrget it. I am an ivy league grad who had a hard time following this book. It is bland and boring. And so complicated--who has time to follow all  of it. What a waste of money 
 I was extremely disappointed in this book. It has very little real content and the book only touches very briefly on many topics. The concepts contained in the book could have been written on 3 sheets of paper. My  guess it is written for children to see some of the animation concept 
 gary grant's mother did not look a bit like his mother, more like his wife, the age difference simply non-exist! a terrible cast. the other problem was the attitude the mother towards his son. she simply despised him, but in fact, her son was a quite successful and respectful person in the society. i just don't know why the mother role was so cynical to her son.  some of the plot twists in this movie also looked very pretentious. the genre also losing grip, could hardly determined itself either a thriller or a comedy. so many scenes simply looked too staged and too phony, the absurdity of the screenplay was self-served to be imposed as normal in a common sense, but of course, if the viewers could lose themselves from the logic, anything was possible and acceptable. in that era, most of the popular movies were all like this one, mixed with romance, suspensful twists of the scenario,  actions, thugs, beautiful and mysterious women, almsot non-stop romantic theme music, sound effect synchronized with all the movements and reactions with the actors and every part of the stories. we've watched this movie couple of times before, but this time, after watched it developed into ridiculous and pretentious scene after scene, we just hit the reject button and put it back into the plastic box. you don't have to agree with me, because this is just my personal viewing after thought.  
 . .If you could sue writers for false advertising regarding what they write on bookjackets, you'd have a great case against these two! This book rehashes old legends and stories but provides nothing new. In fact, it does not even provide a good synopsis of what allegedly occurred during the "experiment", providing only bits and pieces along the way. It actually sounds like an addendum to some previous work that assumes you have heard all the cool details, and provides you with a few coincidences that the authors assume support their case. A don't know much about William L. Moore, but I used to read all Charles Berlitz's books when I was a kid, as I thought the Bermuda Triangle made for some great stories. But as I got older, I realized that that's all they were. Charles Berlitz never made any groundbreaking discoveries while "researching" his Bermuda Triangle books, just rehashed old sailor's tales. I recall him during a guest spot on the "Larry King Live" program, and when I Coast Guard officer called in and provided known, verifiable details on some of his "without a trace" cases, Berlitz looked like a monkey. As a former Coast Guard Rescue Pilot myself, stationed for 3 years in Borinquen, Puerto Rico (one of the apexes of the "Triangle"), I can also assure you that it is quite easy for an aircraft or moderately sized vessel to "disappear without a trace", and that there is nothing mysterious about it. . .it's a big ocean! I witnessed the indistinct horizons and other phenomena, all of which had perfectly good explanations. Save yourself some money and avoid all books that have Charles Berlitz's name associated with them unless you're reading them for "entertainment purposes only" 
 We made the mistake of buying this ABRIDGED version of The Hundred Days, not noticing the FINE PRINT. The reader was very good, but the material truncated, choppy, and not "up to snuff." If you are a devoted fan of the Aubrey-Maturin stories, hurry up and read, yes, read the book. There's not a moment to lose 
 As tempted as I am to give this book 3 stars, 2 stars is closer to rating the whole.  First, this book is for the novice. If you're more than a little familiar with medieval European history, you'll find nothing new here except Cahill's sometimes quirky interpretations of people and events. For some, these interpretations alone will be enough to revisit Hildegard, Abelard, and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Those who've read full length biographies of the main "characters" or the Durants' Story of Civilization or even Freeman's Closing of the Western Mind may want to skip this volume.  The point of Cahill's Hinges of History series seems to be "if you think history isn't fun and relevant, think again." I have a soft spot for such ventures so Cahill starts out in the plus column with me. I enjoyed "How the Irish Saved Civilization" for what is was, pop history meant to whet but not satisfy the appetite. Approach this volume with that in mind and you will likely enjoy it. I found numerous points of disagreement with his "theories" - the rise of feminism, for instance, hardly began with Eleanor!  Unfortunately, Cahill goes off the rails in the introduction and in the conclusion. In the Intro Cahill praises Italy's anti-death penalty stance and then detours to tell us about his "friend" who was on Texas's death row for a crime "he probably didn't commit", was a great guy and was ultimately executed and isn't modern day America wrong wrong wrong about the death penalty. This left me asking two questions: 1) huh? and 2) why doesn't Cahill write a book and tell his friend's story instead of shoehorning it into the Middle Ages?  When Cahill rants about the pedophile scandals in the US Catholic Church while sadly ignoring similar scandals in Ireland and in the Anglican Church in Australia it feels like what it is - a rant, not a commentary on history or current events. When he then makes veiled comparisons between Philip the Fair of France - who is barely mentioned in the main text - and a certain American President (who he doesn't name so I guess I won't either), Cahill's take on Philip the Fair is so wrong-headed and lame, on top of being entirely unaddressed in the previous pages that I couldn't help feeling more than a little tricked. Again, why doesn't Cahill take his strongly held views about current events and write about them on their own? As it is, Cahill risks making the entire book look like a scam - he's not really interested in the Middle Ages, just scoring a few points. I don't believe that is the case but Cahill's antics damage his credibility even as a popular historian. Hence the 2 stars. I hope Cahill's editors exercise a bit more restraint for the next volume of Hinges 
 Got this camera for my wife - a digital novice - during Christmas 2005. Camera is easy to use and takes good pictures. Easily interfaces with PC through USB. However, I also (as did another reviewer) started having problems after about 11 months. Camera would not take pictures as the CCD went bad. Luckily I had an extended service contract and it was repaired. Unfortunately, it just quit working again (April 2007) and the service contract company says they "...won't bother fixing it again..." and is refunding my purchase price. Gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time. Good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract 
 It certainly is no surprise with the development of technology and expansion of capitalism that knowledge-based workers are the future in American Society. It seems to me that Drucker spent too much time attempting to criticize Marx, which was a complete failure. Drucker didn't even fully analyze Globalization in its entirety.  The only credit that should be given to this book is his analyzation of the American worker. Nonetheless, he offers a limited viewpoint on all aspects of society. Look elsewhere if you want to get a better understanding of where our world is headed and what state we are in. Drucker neglects the whole and simply accepts what backs his own perspective 
 This book was recommended to me by so many people--and intelligent people at that!--but I was highly disappointed.  Not only is it not written well, but the ending is anti-climactic.  The dialogue is written poorly, with no real personality to it; characters' motives often go unexplained; the fantastical/magical elements of the story appear sporadically, as do the main character's special powers in the kitchen; additionally, the extensive description of the recipes bog down the plot movement.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.    
 It is my belief that people who really know what they are talking about can explain their thoughts clearly. I cannot be sure if the fault in this book is with the original author or the translator, but it certainly does not measure up to this criterion. It may be of interest to photography academics, but I doubt if a photographer will get much out of it that is useful 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 I really don't think that changing my voice mail will help me succeed in my corporation. The author talks about mixing two forms of language (Edge and Center) to have a perfect communication with the people you work with (employees, employers, boss, etc) and never tells you how to mix these concepts... and besides, if a certain form of language works for me, center or edge, I really don't see the point on changing the way I speak.I never close a book forever before finishing it but after reading a couple of pages after the middle of the book and realized that I could be reading something else so I decided to stop with the torture 
 I am writing this review only because all the other reviews are so favorable.  Harington develops his settings very competently, occasionally eloquently (see Pangburn's review of 8/7/03).  There is plenty of plot.  I was very interested at times, and I can see how some readers might love this book.  However,  his characters are not really developed, and I just could not take them seriously. When he describes life in prison, he does not have the skill to transform despair and horror into art.  At other times the plot reads like a TV script.  Enjoy the book as a kind of historical novel, if you can, but this is not good literature 
 Maybe it was just me, but this concert DVD is a MAJOR disappointment!  It's quite surprising to see how little (if any) connection Madonna makes with the audience.  Shorn of her locks, her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here. Perhaps it's a result of her having become larger than life (ala Striesand, Whitney Houston,etc.).  Despite all the razzle-dazzle here, examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound.  Songs like "Vogue" and "Express Yourself" should have been rousing stompers.  Instead, they are overstylized, choreographed to the max and perfunctory (the effect is like watching a canned TV award show performance).  Worst of ALL is her ill-conceived "Like A Virgin."  I can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom, but "Virgin" recast as 1940's Marlene Dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch(complete with unisex tuxedo, top hat and faux-German accent)???? This is a shocking lapse in judgment--and boring to boot!!!    The only sign of life comes near the end, with the lock-step performance of "Holiday," which is seductively refashioned as a funky marching-band romp.  Here, she and her dancers perform in what must have been stifling maxi-length military-style coats!  One look at this performance and you can't help but wish for the juice of her earlier stuff. No one begrudges the right of an artist to change and grow, but there is something to be said for giving the audience what it came for.  I'm willing to give Madonna one more shot and pick up the Blond Ambition DVD when or if it becomes available.  Until then, my best advice is to check out DVDS featuring the likes of Tina Turner, Donna Summer or even Sade--they all prove that you can make the old new again, share and reveal something that a studio production can't, and thus never need to worry about going stale. Real concert greatness is not overstylized pomp--it's audience connection!   
 Ok, here's my journey with this book:  I watched the movie "The Notebook" and loved it I read the book "The Notebook" and it was... alright A friend told me "The Wedding" was better than "The Notebook" I didn't see how it couldn't be I started reading "The Wedding" and it was AWFUL People kept telling me "oh, keep reading, it gets better" The reviews on the back mentioned a surprising twist I kept reading It never got better The "twist" occured with about 5 pages left and was lame  I have concluded that the people that read and liked this book must have been around 16 years old (unfortunately those who recommended it to me were older and should have known better) and haven't actually read a book that is well written and has a good storyline.  Easy read DOES NOT EQUAL good read.  This book was easy to read (in language, not interest)... it was short... but it was pointless.  There was no substance whatsoever and was really predictable and painfully drawn out (and it was only about 200ish pages... 50 would have sufficed) 
 I was lucky enough not to buy this book, never feel specially draw into such matters as werewolf,but I didn't resist the temptation to browse it briefly at my local used bookstore,a lot of empty empty words,....   
 Andrew Sinclair's tedious and pompous book about the supposed discovery of America by his ancestors, the Sinclairs of the Orkney Islands, and his supposed discovery of the Holy Grail. is the closest thing to saying he has found the Lockness monster. This pseudo-scientific bunch of baloney never should have been published. God only knows why it was. If this is all Sinclair can produce these days, he should pack it in and take up checkers.  Chess would be too challenging 
 I think the author focused too much on the negative aspects of the sport and was too critical of many of the skaters except with exceptioon of a few whom she is an obvious fan of and throughout the book she talked about what skaters were thinking and what they were feeling...which made me wonder.... is she a sports reporter or mind reader!!??!!?? 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
 After my trusty Archos player's display broke, I figured I upgrade and get me a 60GB iAudio X5. As a journalist doing interviews, I was also very giddy to get the line-in to record interviews straight to mp3. A friend of mine loves his player, so I didn't even flinch when I saw the price.  Ever since then I regret my decision.  Apparently my player has a software problem. It speeds up all my mp3 files. I tried several different programs to rip the mp3s and always got the same thing. That is when I was actually able to upload mp3s, because oftentimes I received error messages and the player refused to do as told.  So what then: Upgrade the firmware. Sure. If you can make it work and I couldn't. The description online is poorly written. But it's essentially like this: Start with a fully loaded battery. Unplug the A/C cabel and unpload the Firmware. Now replug the A/C cable and that should tell the player to update the firmware. Well all it does is conclude that the battery isn't full anymore so it better recharges and does nothing else.  I.e. I couldn't get the firmware to update and I tried for the last hour.  Therefore I'll take the player back to the store and ask for a refund. And I'll get another Archos - and continue to live with its misely 20GB 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor.  That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on 
 I rarely put down a book unfinished, but I only got through a third of this one.  1.  Pretty 20-year-olds are boring.  There's a reason why the character Avalon (gossip columnist for the newspaper) stole every scene she was in; she was experienced enough to have some depth, which made the sex charge that much hotter.  2.  While I don't demand too much of a plot from erotic novels, having some storyline makes me anticipate reading on, not just a disconnected series of sex scenes.  3.  This one is purely personal:  I live in LA.  I love LA.  This, Madam, is not LA -- it's the Los Angeles of cliche and clique.  Yes, again, this is a fantasy, but if I'm constantly arguing with the book, I kind of lose track of who is doing what to whom with what in whose bed 
 This is perhaps the most disappointing King book I have ever read (and considering that I have read "Desperation" and "Insomnia" that is saying a lot).  The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story.  I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top.  The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book.  I thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book.  I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of "The Green Mile:  Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I'll read my junk mail.  I cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery 
 Two riders have ridden off into the sunset since the release of Enjoy the melodic sunshine. One of them, Daniel Wylie, has since carved out a solo career thru three solo albums that are a match for that beautiful record. Who knows what happened to the other guy, but what is clear is that the three remaining riders are heading for anonymous oblivion with this awful record. Someone must've told them it would be a good idea to impersonate early U2 but whoever it was forgot to tell them you need to add great songs to the mix for it to work. This album lacks good songs. The averageness of the material is saddeningly frightening. A band who was king of the hill are now licking the souls of the good bands. I'm only hearing one great song. Emptiness is that one sole cracker and shows up the rest of the toons for what they are. Sub standard. I can't believe what I'm reading on here when others compared a coupla the toons to the Beatles. Gulp! You got to be joking. You're reading like a marketing person for the band in disguise. I know we all hear it our own way, so I'd say try to hear the record before you part with your cash. 
 Though I bought this boxing glove with a $20 discount, I still think it was overpriced.  First, I had a hard time getting my hand into the glove and I only have medium-sized hands.  I make do with taped hands but using this glove with the "popular" Evergel hand wraps is out of the question.  (Tape's better than the Evergels anyway.)  Second, on one of the gloves, the Everlast label on the elastic wrist wrap started coming off, though I'd only just started hitting a heavy bag.  It's made of this cheap plastic-like material.  (You'd think for $100, you'd get a glove with every detail of medium to high quality.)  I cutoff the hanging label entirely.  Third, the product description states five distinct layers of foam are in the glove between your hand and point of contact.  With the 10 oz glove, it doesn't feel like anything special, just a thin layer of foam.  I'm not impressed with the padding.  Overall, the glove is of medium to low quality.  It even looks cheap.  (The leather is less than a millimeter thick and the stitching is ordinary.)  I'll use the glove as I've already spent the money, but my next glove I think is going to be a Title Platinum.  Unfortunately, Everlast seems to have gone the way of cheap mass production and net profit at the sacrifice of it's reputation 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 If your idea of a good alternative film is one devoid of plot, good acting and any semblance of structure then you might enjoy this piece of utter rubbish.  I think this is a sad homily to gay men who get excited seeing ugly German gay men with shaved pubes getting off with one another and then call it art 
 Jackies wild Seattle is a adventure story about two kids that stay with their uncle in the summer in Seattle,Washington. Cody, Shannon, uncle Neal and they save animals. The two kids are the many caracters  Cody and Shannon. Cody is the one saving all the animals. Shannon is the one woring about her parents. The plot of the book is that uncle Neal gets unjured and shannon has to save uncle Neal. On the way cody is always saving animals. the authors style is that he likes adventure books and the themes are that they save many animals and they save many animals and they save their uncle. Its mostly sad range and the book is sick sometimes and also sad. I havent read a book related to the book. The tipe of reader that would like this book ts a person that is into adventure story. 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 This is a terrible movie, both from a religious and artistic point of view.  From an artistic point of view, it is often incoherent, the plot line jumbled, the characterisations inconsistent.  Also, many things are changed around in the film, that would have been more potent had they retained the details of reality they were denied here.  From a religious point of view, the story flat-out lies regarding Saint Pio and events in his life, aspects of his religious beliefs, and comes very close to slander regarding fictional events portrayed in this film.  The film portrays his father as confessing to adultery (this can be nothing but fiction, as confessions are sacred and sealed - plus, his father and mother were very devout and saintly and devoted to one another), and it portrays Saint Pio as having some sort of romantic obsession with one of his spiritual children.  Nothing of these sorts took place.  Ever!  From an artistic point of view, the device of an elderly priest harassing Saint Pio on his deathbed is almost humorously clumsy and facile.  I could not laugh, however; because this is also another untruth.   No such person visited Saint Pio.  From a religious point of view, I also found this story device distressing.  The film strongly implies this man is the devil or one of his emissaries - and yet, Saint Pio begs him to hear his confession.   This would not happen.  Saint Pio literally battled satan daily, and the devil never won.  And yet, in THIS film, Saint Pio is portrayed as wailing, "Why does he (the devil) always win?".   Sacrilege.  I wish I had my money back.  I wish I had the two hours of my life back which were spent watching this lying, clunky, ambling trash bin of a film.  The filmmakers clearly have an agenda against religion, shown at every opportunity - lecherous priests, money grubbing religious, etc.   My skin felt like it was crawling, watching this (and yet I felt I must, to be truly fair in my summation).  They portray Saint Pio as an athlete bounding up stairs even in old age - in reality he slowly shuffled due to his stigmata wounds.   Some of their jabs are subtle, others devious (see above examples) and still others are outright slaps in the face - of our dear Saint and of the Church.   I felt anger watching it, but most of all sadness, and traces of the evil - some of its lies were so sneaky.   If you haven't read every book about Saint Pio you possibly could - you might not know just how badly some of the events of his life are twisted, here.     Saint Pio asked his spiritual children not to give him a black eye.  This film gives him a black eye.   I hope you will not buy it.   Please seek out a documentary or a book made by those who loved and knew him, instead.   This film did not have the participation of such.   Perhaps you should ask yourself why 
 Everybody say CONGO is a film about scientists find killer gorillas in th rain forest. This is true, but before we get to the psycho monkeys, we have to sit trough hostile militants, the Hungry Hungry Hippos in their cruel retirement, and guys who just get this occasional urge to shoot planes out of the sky with seeker rockets that thwarted with flare guns. The killer gorillas show up in the first five minutes to kill Bruce Campbell (dang you monkeys!) and disappear until the last twenty minutes or so. And this film is 110 minutes.  Well, I guess I can't get too angry at CONGO, it at least has decent effect and a few cool action sequences. Those are really the only two good things I can say about this borefest. Stay away unless your a Michael Chritchon completest.    
 A daring young atomic scientist teams up with three high school seniors to attempt the first-ever rocket trip to the moon -- that's the premise of Heinlein's Rocket Ship Galileo.  Readers who aren't immediately turned off by the story's wild improbabilities and dated subject matter may find this book an entertaining adventure.  To begin with, Heinlein's story is well paced and solidly constructed for once, a pleasant change from the episodic hodgepodges he created in his later years.  He skillfully introduces elements of conflict at an early stage of the story, (as sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent the voyage from taking place) and he even manages to build some suspense, an effect Heinlein is not usually noted for.  His descriptions of the mechanics of the moon rocket and its voyage are both convincing and interesting, despite being badly dated.  One real letdown is the characters, who are curiously undeveloped, even for science fiction.  The three boys themselves are virtually interchangeable, and Doctor Cargraves isn't much more distinctive.  If some attempt had been made to give these young men their own individual personalities, the readers might find them easier to identify with.  As it is, it's hard to really care about these characters, even when something horrible happens to them.  The really big problem, though, is that this book really hasn't aged very well. For example, Heinlein tries to show us how a moon rocket was outfitted and launched privately, by one scientist and his youthful helpers, working on a shoestring budget, after a few months of labor; when after all, any schoolchild knows that it took NASA and the U.S. government billions of dollars, working with hundreds of the finest minds on the planet for nearly a decade, to accomplish the real thing.  Once our heroes reach the moon, the story gets even more improbable, as they find that the moon is already inhabited.  Naturally, Heinlein wrote this novel for younger readers, and it was published at a time when space travel seemed utterly impossible.  As such, it was written for the tastes of the times, and times have changed dramatically.  For instance, the only women in this book are the boys' mothers, who have very little to say about anything important.  The villains are cartoonish stereotypes, who are summarily dispatched without any show of remorse.  Although the book is reasonably well-written overall, and older readers may take some nostalgic pleasure in its simplicity and naivet, today's young readers may want something more wildly speculative than a moon landing.  On average, if you're old enough to remember Sputnik, you can be forgiven for loving this book; but if Neil Armstrong is just another boring guy you heard about in school, you probably won't be too impressed by Rocket Ship Galileo 
 In the book Catherine stops a lot of guys from marrying her .She does that because she doesn't want to get married .Catherine likes to catch stuff on fire like guy who try to marry her. She also hides from her chores all the time because it makes her look like a good wife .She hates writing her journal. She also hates her father trying to marry her off 
 This book is ok, but im not too keen on the way he writes - or more precisely the way he views people.  He tends to put down those who are different from him, where as other astrologers tend to focus on the difficulties you are experiancing and how to overcome them.    The interpretations are about 3 sentances long and to be honest its not really worth the money.    I brought parkers astrology which covers the same things and far more for around the same price. I recomend you look into getting this one instead - its great value and also a brilliant resourse for other basic elements of astrology. Plus - its understandable for the beginner.  You could also create a birth chart free on line at astro.com and use the parkers book to interpret it. (I sent off the free birth chart voucher that W. Hewit gives you about 6 months ago and still havent recieved it 
 The author of this book clearly has problems with making his own mind work.  The problems are myriad, but I will outline the most glaring ones.  1.He makes an a priori assumption in the existance of supernatural forces and assumes they were at work in the events he describes.  He never questions the existance of the supernatural or even looks for more mundane explanations for any of the things he describes.    2.He is excessively vague.  He never sets up any real central premise.  He talks about "dark forces" and the like, but never really gives a clear definition of what these "dark forces" are, where they come from, what they have to do with anything, etc.  The "strange forces" Lachman is fond of attributing every single detail and incident too are never second guessed, and he assumes they are responsible for all, even while he denies the reader any information on what these "forces" are.  3.The lack of any central premise other than an expose of the "dark side" of the sixties makes this book read more like a trivia book of sixties counterculture figures than anything else.  Which brings me to problem four.  4.Lackmans complete lack of any sort of premise or argument has the effect of, halfway or so in to the book, making you wonder why you're reading it.  Yes, this and that bit of little known trivia may get a few laughs at a dinner party, but without anything to tie all of this together, it seems fragmented and meaningless, and a better formated would be a book of one liner "did you know?" bits of info, without any pretentions to the book having any sort of point.  5.Lachman is neither a skeptic nor anything resembling a responsible, reputable journallist.  Much of what he presents as evidence for the "dark side" of things is little more than anecdotal stories.  Did Anton Lavey really get a human leg from a university medical student?  Well, that can be verified.  LAchman could contact that university, check their records, see if any body parts were signed out at that time or if any went missing, but I suspect that Lachman knew fact checking would rob him of the sensationallism that this book if packed with.  6.Lachman further engages in questionable practices when it comes to trying to weave some of this together.  He tries to connect various figures and ideas, but his links are tenuous, and he often engages in simple, reprehensible, guilty by association.  7.His conclusion offers not only any clarity as to what any of this information has to do with anything, or if it is even relevant to anything current, much less how it would be relevant, but no solution either.  Lachman seemingly disapproves of people getting involved in these "dark" things, etc. but he offers nothing better.  He offers no alternative, and offers no compelling argument as to why much of the things he singles out for criticism or bad, and much of this seems to be Lachmans own personal superstition.  This book is not poorly argued.  Rather, it seems to have no specific argument, and is little more than a lot of guilt by association, superstition, and tenuous links between unimportant people (now honestly, have Crowley, Learly, lavey, etc. had any effect on ANYTHING beyond rock music?).  Lachman comes off as some cryptotheocrat.  His tone is little, if no, different from that of right wing televangelists and scaremongers who have no substantive argument.  But at least those morons can say they oppose something on the basis of their flimsy religion, while Lachman doesn't even have that going for him.  His attacks on rock music and pop culture fads make him sound like a stodgy conservative alarmist, while his singling out of Eastern religions makes him seem so xenophobic I was expecting him to start attacking Chinese Take Out and accusing it of harboring darkness.  And the subject matter alone is subject to scrutiny;  he goes after what amounts of pop culture fads, rock music, and minority religions, and not only does he do so with little substance, but he fails to demonstrate why these things are important enough to warrant criticism in the first place.  Lachman seems to know little about comparative and world religion, and I expect that knowledgeable scholars, intellectuals, and followers of Eastern religions and new age religions would find his book replete with errors, exagerrations, and stereotypes of the sort you would find in a b horror film.  Lachman simply couldn't argue his way out of a paper bag.  
 This product eliminated one step.  However, the one step took as long to do as two steps 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 Whenever I read reviews that use words such as "extraordinary", "wonderful", "great", etc. I'm sort of naive in the respect that I expect to get at the least something that closely models itself to deserve such accolades. This is not a tell-all book. Do we need to read a book to know that when starting a business, you need a lawyer, an accountant, business insurance? Do we need to be taught business basics such as how to create a brochure, write a business plan, etc.? That the reader from NJ/PA worked with the author, explains her glowing recommendation for this book of course. She's totally contradictory with her review in that respect. NO you can not become an overnight success from reading a book.The sophomoric comment about such is funny. Also, it's INTERESTING, that the reader has engaged the author in work, yet finds it necessary to write, what is obviously a defense of fair reviews of the "second" edition. Didn't he/she read the first edition? What I was expecting was "concierge /errand service" how to's. They are limited. And yes, I have read books that not only answered all my questions, but gave me more. We all have had books, that we refer to as our "bibles, cannot live without" the ones that become worn, and food stained and you have to actually buy another copy because you've worn out yours from frequent use and constant referring to it to answer your questions, when the unexpected arise. They are called reference books, not show me, tell me, what do I do books, but "reference books". THIS is not one of those books. Period. It is a basic, wholly rudimentary script of "so you're starting a business", great... here's what you should do. It is a simple primer and nothing more. Yet it touts itself as a inside industry show and tell. IT IS NOT! That's just a personal opinion 
 The author treats the media as if it is the devil. as if all tv, computers, etc are bad. This book wil surely destroy some child's lif 
 Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.    
 The problem with using brain imaging to understand how it works is that currently all the published papers contain irreproducible data. This means that these nice papers show us more noise than real data, and 'contribute'  confusion rather than understanding. This book, like the rest of the  literature, 'deals' with this problem by simply ignoring it 
 Mine also had scratches upon delivery.  But putting it together was a nightmare. I should say IS, because I am still trying to put it together!  The slots do not line up well with each other, causing you to try numerous times to get the pieces to fit together.  Also the decorative pieces that go on the upper sides do not slide completely in, so I was forced to (with great difficulty) get them out again and leave it with these empty slots on the side looking rather bad.  The idea of this item would have been great and very convenient if it had not come with scratches and was much easier to put together 
 It is so sad to me that the last several of the once intertaining Cat Who books have really been terrible.  I'm now on the lookout for another "series" to enjoy, and I'll only buy another Cat Who book at the dollar store 
 This is the worst climb on ever made.  It was a xmas gift for my kids needless to say it was not put up in the morning.  We had 3 adults and it would not stay together each time a different spot would pop out.  We took it back to toys r us and they had to use a huge mallet and bang on it to put in in the right spot.  Well then the gardner came and the whole thing fell apart and that is how it is now.  It is going back to toys r us tonight.  This is the worst piece of junk, please dont waste  your money.  The kangaroo climber is awsome and didnt fall apart once!  Forget this one they need to take it off the market 
 This is a very lean version, with some characters being removed or merged with other characters.  Whole sections of original dialogue have been removed, or at best, changed.  Avoid this version like a robot plague 
 There is so much more to the imaginary London than the author conveys.  This book feels like it was dictated to complete an assignment.  Buy the Ackroyd book, London: A Biography instead...and then use your own imagination.  I agree with previous reviewers who called it superficial with the real book still waiting for an author to write it 
 Nansook Hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to HyoJin Moon, but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents' machinations to get her married into the Moon family. Eyewitnesses tell of Nansook visiting the Moon household and knowing full well of HyoJin's excesses in advance of her marriage. The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family, and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first Moon daughter, they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son. Though I don't know all the motives, the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that Ms. Hong has not been honest about. It is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of Rev Moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect, given her own deceit 
 Since 1980 I have tried in vain (and hard) to really like this band. Although Starz are comprised of competent players, their songs are simply bogawful! Sorry, it's as simple as this. (Two star rating for the nice guitar sound 
 I had to read part of this book for a graduate-level American Studies course, and if it hadn't been a required text, you couldn't have PAID me to read it.  There are some very interesting things to say about blackface minstrelsy, but if Lott says them, they are lost to me in between the countless references to sex.  Everything, in Eric Lott's analysis, is phalic and/or homoerotic.  A tamborine is an anus.  A nose is a penis.  A throat is "vaginal."  And a common theme in the book?  White men envy the black man's penis.  PUH-LEEZE.  So when grown men can't say "wee-wee" and snicker in the fourth-grade bathroom any longer do they just write a book about it and call it academia?  His obsession with sexual themes was offensive and downright silly.  When I picked up the book, I was hoping to learn something useful about race or class or culture, but instead, Lott had me scrutinizing 19th century minstrelsy posters for anything that might remotely resemble a sexual organ.  With so many wonderful books in the world to read, I don't know why anyone would voluntarily waste their time on this one 
 i cannot get thru this one.  i started fast-forwarding but there didn't appear to have any good spots.  when i saw that christian cammpbell was in this, i thought, this has to be good.  i had just finished a movie where he starred.  can't remember the name of it.  i guess a person should never buy a movie because of who stars in it.  tori spelling is well known, but not to me.  someone should have put her out of her misery right from the start.  she does not play a flake very well, and i don't know what to call her except a flake.  i stopped this dvd in about the first 1/2 hour and will go back and give it another shot, but with tori spelling as one of the leads, i already know this one does not have a prayer.  i would say; save your money on this one unless you are under 13.  i have a ton of straight and gay movies that tell a story and a couple or few that don't.  this one falls into this category. one that came with this one was "the broken hearts club" and while not my cup of tea it was far superior to this piece of garbage.   
 A ghastly book by the sadly misnamed Sarah Smiley. I have a weakness for domestic memoirs (Jean Kerr, Shirley Jackson, Erma Bombeck) and I am, myself, a military wife, so I was excited to find this book and fully expected to enjoy it.  I hated it. A lot. With the exception of books about serial killers, I don't believe I've ever read a book with a protagonist I liked less. 260 pages of whining. No empathy for anyone: poor Sarah always has it worse. Her mother (an admiral's wife) comments that deployments used to be worse back in the days before email. No, says Sarah, email is worse because there is more disappointed anticipation. ?!?   A friend suffers a miscarriage and Sarah has to be literally shamed into going to help her (Sarah doesn't like blood, you see). Nowhere in the remainder of the book is there an inkling of sympathy for this woman (also a military wife) who has had three miscarriages, the last one while her husband was deployed. It's all about Sarah (who has to babysit for the woman's older child).  Another friend's husband is sent home from the deployment and their family must relocate to California (from Florida) in a month. The reasons for this are not specified, but I can tell you that an officer isn't usually sent home early from a deployment for good behavior. Sarah's response? First, jealousy that her friend's husband is coming home; second, discontent that she (Sarah) will be losing her friend!  The worst, though, is her treatment of her husband, whom she is mad at throughout the entire book. To use one example only: Sarah's husband sends her an email -- one that would have broken my heart had my husband sent it to me -- in which he writes sadly that he will miss seeing their new baby's first smile, just as he missed seeing their older son's. Sarah's response to this? To be angry because that was the only email he sent her that day.   I finished the book only because I was hoping she would grow up! Nope, though. She was just as self-absorbed and whiney on the last page as she had been on the first. I came to Amazon and read the reviews and found several people who said something like "I don't know anything about the military, but now I have an understanding of what military wives go through." I hate the idea that people will read this tripe and think it is in any way representative of me, or of any of the fine military spouses I have known!  And this was a memoir! I can't imagine writing a book in which I acted like a spoiled brat from page 1 to page 260 and allowing it to be published with my picture on the front! Of course, Sarah doesn't think she is a spoiled brat -- oh no! Sarah pees champagne and poops gold bricks and is the white-hot center of the universe...  Once I finished it I threw the thing in the garbage. Yep, the garbage. Usually I donate books I don't want anymore to the library, but that didn't seem final enough in this case. So it's on its way to the York County Waste Treatment Facility right now. And I'm not a bit sorry! 
 Who open scroll always profit says an ancient Chinese motto. The same applies to books. I profited from reading this one, but I didn't profit much or enough. The work is uneven and needs focus. The title is poor because it misnames the subject of the book which is, incidentally, not how to win an anrgument, but how to think clearly. Some of the author's points would have passed me by and probably other points would have been downright confusing had I not had a background in logic. And one wonders about a book on the Art of Deception deceiving people into believing that the book is one thing when it is really about something else. Perhaps some well meaning editior or PR person mispersuaded the author to use this fake and phony title in the hope of increased sales. A few bones: I don't like the word argument because of its two meanings. Demonstration is better. The formal analysis of arguments (my demonstrations) in chapter three hits the reader on the head: Although it is technically correct, without a background in formal logic you might get lost fast. The chapter could have done better explaining the differences between contraries and contradictions and the reasons for the other errors which are never clearly stated. The author just assumes the reader will get it when I have a feeling derived from teaching logic for years that they won't and don't. For intstance, why the undistributed middle term invalidates a proof is clear to me only because I knew it from previous studies, and thought long and hard about it, not from what the author says here in his book. And the worst sin of all: Somewhere in the middle of the discussion of groupthink, the author seems to get bored with his own discussion. No wonder the reader nods off. Those interested in improving their critical thinking should read Asking the Right Questions. Those interested in understanding errors in logic might consult The Art of Argument by St. Aubyn, a book that hits hard where we need improvement by showing us the common errors of thinking of overgeneralization, false analogy, vague definition, and partial selection of the evidence 
 For those of you put off by the negativity of most of the Amazon reviews of this book, let me suggest one concrete reason why this book is not worth your time. The story of the 2004 Red Sox was a story of great players. Certainly, Theo Epstein deserves much credit, but it was David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez and Keith Foulke and Bill Mueller and...on an on, and most definately Pedro Martinez. A tip off to the problem with the book is to look up Ramirez, Manny in the index. The dearth of references told me immediately that Shaughnessy had not gotten past his personal animosities. On the subject of Pedro, he is pathetic. There are no good stories like one would expect from an "insider account." Yet again we hear how huge the Varitek-Arod fight was. Yet again, he spews about Nomar. A few quotes here and there but mostly a glossy distant portrait by a writer who sounds deeply unhappy. If you followed the season as a fan, you won't learn anything you didn't already know. Stick with the videos until a better book comes alon 
 Pauvre Greta...  She is radiant in this disaster of a film; primarily because her love interest is Ramon Navarro - a gay Spanish actor, playing a straight Russian prince. It is very sad, laughable casting - like a gay Ricky Ricardo pretending he is a...I can't think of a Russian, straight counterpart to Clark Gable.  Garbo tries hard. Barrymore tries harder. Adrian tries the hardest. To no avail. AVOID this film at all cost. An interesting plot line, filmed with calamitous results 
 I seem to be in a minority here, but here goes...I hated this book. I don't *care* that the science stood up to scrutiny, the narrative style was tedious and irritating, the plot was laborious, and the characterisation was shallow. Definitely not a hit for me 
  I am really confused this book or booklet was like a bad version of a Guidepost. It wasn't all that witty and  the tales weren't that good. I bought this book figuring--It would charming and funny like the book "Marley and me".It was lame, dull, religious and preachy.I feel like I should charge Amazon a fee for wasting my time money and energies! What a RIP OFF! Below 1 star if that is viable 
 Coelho has really gone over the edge with this nonsense.  Not one single incident is to be believed and instead of penetrating is funny.   He either overdosed on drugs or alcohol or was hallucinating.  I couldn't stop laughing at what I know was meant to be a very serious book. If Coelho believes this actually happened to him, he's in bad shape and can't be taken seriously. The promising author of Veronica Decides to Die is quickly deteriorating.  How sad 
 This book is more of a magazine (with advertisements!).  While it has many cute pages that parents have made with a photo or two, the descriptions of how each page was done are only useful for people who have enough scrapbooking experience to recognize the brief and sometimes obscure references to paper and lettering sources.  There are almost no explanations of how the pages were created (no step by step instructions or tips or anything) except to identify the sources of the products used.  A big disappointment 
 It is difficult to believe that such a slow and dull book could be written about such a compelling subject.  The reviewers who have lamented the short, choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another, without benefit of full explanation or connection, are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book.  I had to read some paragraphs several times and even then didn't understand what I was reading.  It was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind, as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on.  The description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages, which incited one yawn after another.  The book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances.  For example, the narrative is littered with sentences like: "She made for the east exit..."  Okay, fine, but did she run, walk, crawl, hop, skip, jump, or fly to the east exit?  I just don't know what to picture there.  The word "made" says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen.  This type of problem occurs on every page of the book.  I haven't read anything else the author has written, so I hate to be so critical.  I wonder, however, why his editor didn't send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions.  I felt as if I was reading a very hastily-prepared early draft.  I have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations.  This just isn't one of them.  Compare "The Circus Fire" to "Into Thin Air," "Heart of the Sea," "Batavia's Graveyard," or "Ordeal by Hunger" and you'll understand what I mean 
 This was the first book I saw in the store in my search for a good summer read.  The cover intrigued me and so did the description of a young African Elvis impersonator trying to make a life for himself. Who wrote the summary of this book?  Did they even read it?  It's not what this book is about at all.    This book is interesting at first.  As I read on, I kept trying to find where this book was going.  This is difficult as the book switches between the past and the present; unfortunately the two are never reconciled.  About half way through, I found myself skimming through the remaining pages, scanning for a semblance of a plot.  No luck. I gave up on this book- it's just too much work.     
 Martin believes we are on a non-sustainable course - the population is too large, enormous new consumer societies are growing, and technology is becoming powerful enough to wreck the planet.  The 21st century is becoming an age of extremes - wealth and poverty, terrorists acting in the name of religion, experiments that scientists want to perform, etc.  During this century we will either right the world's course, or commit it to increasing negative feedback loops.  Every year we lose 24 billion tons of topsoil and create 15 million acres of new desert.  We are using about 160 billion tons moe water than is being replenished by rain.  Global warming will bring more severe weather and lower crop yields in many of the world's poorest countries.  Meanwhile, in the U.S., the desire for short-term  benefits by government and business overwhelms the desire to solve long-term problems.  Negative Feedback Loops:  Artic ice helps reflect sunlight; however, its melting leads to more absorption of sunlight and greater heating.  At the same time much permafrost contains methane, a powerful worming gas - its melting also creates increased heat absorption.  The oceans help by absorbing CO2, but there is a limit, and the warmer they get, they less they can hold.  We have depleted the Grand Banks fishery to the point it is now closed.  The Black Sea has deteriorated to near uselessness for fishing or as a resort because of pollution and the invasion of an American jellyfish.  (The "good news" is that governments have recognized the problems - hopefully the areas will recover.)  The world is running out of natural capital.  Yet, we spend about $2 trillion/year in perverse subsidies worldwide - agriculture (both to grow, and not-grow), gasoline.  As for overpopulation (the basis of all problems), one strategy is offered by the high correlation between female illiteracy and the fertility rate.  Birth control methods also help, as do jobs for women, and interesting/challenging jobs help even help more.  Over one billion people spend about 70% of their income on food, and the growing water shortage threatens to increase this.  Saudi Arabia increased wheat production 20X from '80 to '94; when the aquifer nearly dried up production fell by half within two years.  Over 12% of crop land in India has been damaged by salination.  Changing crops would help - eg. wheat typically produces 50% more calories/water unit than rice, and meat uses water very intensively.  (Japanese men eat about one-quarter the meat of Americans, smoke more, and live about 8 years longer.)  Improved cultivation using genetically modified seeds would also help - about 40% of crops are lost in the fields to disease, insects, and weeds, though Martin also states that increased crop uniformity also increases long-run vulnerability.  Hydroponics and fish farming offer other good improvements in water usage.  The U.N. lists 49 Least Developed Countries - they have 11% of the world's population and 0.5% of its GDP.  Martin sees hope here though through the lens of DeSoto's observation about titles.  He has found that a majority of homes in 3rd-world and ex-Communist countries are held without title, meaning they can't be used for business collateral.  Yet, DeSoto believes that the savings accumulated in these same countries is 40X the foreign aid received since '45.  In Lima, a demonstration on obtaining authorization to build a house on state-owned land took 6 years and 11 months - even longer to acquire title to the land.  All told, 207 steps in 52 government offices for the first part, and another 728 steps for the latter.  Setting up a one-man cake shop in Cairo and making it legal requires 500+ days.  In other areas (eg. Rwanda) the rule of law has completely broken down.  Martin also notes that in 1960 South Korea and Ghana had nearly identical economic conditions - since, South Korea has bloomed, while Ghana's GDP/person has fallen in half.  Another promising development for the future identified by Martin lies in pebble-bed reactors to generate electricity - impossible to explode, and highly efficient.  At this point, "The Meaning of the 21st Century" goes downhill fast.  The book is basically a collection of other people's work and the first part does provide a useful summary of their findings.  However, the latter pages offer little of use 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 The newest version of Arena is 5.0 . This book teaches based on the version 3.0 
 This read got stagnant at times.  He doesn't go full circle with his idea or at least it isn't expressed thoroughly in this book.  I was looking forward to more interesting stories 
 The first Farseer book impressed me with its great writing and interesting characters. The second book, though not as great, was still a solid sequel. This third Farseer book is a mess (see Kaymin's comments). The 757 page book (paperback version) should have been edited to fewer than 500 pages. A few of the ill-considered, disjointed plot lines also should have encountered the delete key.   What could not be repaired are some of the idiotic key elements such as the fact that no one remembered that the ancient race who helped the citizens of Buck were actually dragons that exist as stone statues until imbued with the memories, souls, and lives of multiple humans. What the heck? And somehow, the protagonist, FitzChivalry, continues to make the same stupid mistakes he did as a teenager and still manages to survive. Of the main characters, only his wit-bonded wolf made reliably sensible decisions.  Given the flaws described above, I am astonished by the many five star reviews of this book. I believe that fans of the first two books were overly generous to this one 
 A friend of mine, who is an avid reader of many types of literature like me, highly recommended this book.  I made it about fifty pages before the confusion, depression, and disinterest forced me to cast it aside.  The book just made me disoriented and tired. 
 This is one of my favorite romantic comedies.  It is funny, touching, and has some of my favorite actors in it.  And it doesn't only center around the main characters but has a great ensemble cast of very interesting people! 
 This book presents a very antiquated and negatively biased view of LA.  I am left doubtful if many of the scenarios in the book were as "bad" as the author leads the reader to believe.  It is naive on the part of the author to separate the actual problems of LA from other  large American cities, and present them as mutually exclusive to LA. This book panders to a seemingly worldwide hatred of LA, and a kind of love affair with the notion of a eventual LA apocalypse. What a disappointment that the author investigates no deeper than what the popular opinion of Los Angeles is, and panders to this misconception 
 I found this book to be poorly written and disorganized. It also mentions some products in general terms but never tells what the products are 
 I found myself listening for 30 seconds to each song and then skipping it.  It's nothing new.  It's not that it's a bad CD, it's just not very good.  The songs are a little more fast paced and "pop-ish."  Overall, the CD is a departure from her typical style.  I felt kind of like I had put 50 cents in the soda machine for a Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper came out instead.  
 Ric still assumes you can get 10% on investments.  Right.  And your Enron retirement plan will keep you cozy until you're 99 
 I just finished reading this book, complaining the whole way how I did not like it.  I should have put it down, but I thought it had to get better at some point.  There was too much sex (graphic sometimes)and no substance.  While You Were Gone by Sue Miller was better 
 My mother gave me this book and her first cookbook, too.  Hard to believe, but this book seems worse than the first one.  She must get paid a bazillion dollars by the Processed Food Association because no one in their right mind would use so much crappy processed food in their recipes.  She seems totally oblivious to the fact that fresh food is available in her regular supermarket and that its just as easy to use in recipes 
 I have recordings of JRB and seen him live. I was gravely disappointed with this CD. This just wasn't the CD for me and I am a big fan of his too. Lauren Kennedy just isn't the right performer to showcase his wonderful talent. There is no feeling or soul from her and basically it's the same monotonous repetition of sound throughout. There is absoultely no connection between her and the music, like a 'robot' following orders. She doesn't possess much sound range and weighs too much on belting. I have not seen her perform live but I am sure she belongs on stage and not in the studio. Belting is fine for broadway but not for recording or studio quality. There is certainly no future for her in recording because if she couldn't pull it off with JRB this time, then it is pretty much a failure as I am sure he did the best he could with her voice. The mix is uncreative, there is no flow and Lauren just doesn't match his style and ability. Bottom line, it was just so plain dull to listen too. My advice to JRB is to find a singer that develops a connection with the music to truly convey 'meaning' so the listener can connect. Perhaps another singer would have made me feel differently and I hope his next CD finds better singing talent. Luckily this CD was a gift because I am glad I didn't waste money on it myself! ~ JRB disappointed fa 
 This book has no scientific proof of exisitence nor validity. Purely speculation and guess work seemingly based upon one persons viewpoint and assumptions made thereof. I would not take this book seriously nor read in in any other manor than to fall asleep at night! 
 I agree with the reviewer who called it a "bogus treatise." I read this book after personally witnessing a remote viewing experiment (documented on my website). I did not read the whole book, only chapters 1-7 and 16 (I wasn't interested in debunking Uri Geller). Chapter 3 begins with a Robert Browning quote "...you'll find what you desire", I assume targeted at "believers" in the paranormal. But it equally applies to the authors. In their "replication" of Targ's remote viewing experiments the authors selected as the viewers a few students and a housewife who "believed themselves to be psychic to some degree." Of course, they did not believe in the existence of the phenomena they were testing -- otherwise they might have allowed themselves to make the assumption that it might require someone who practices. If you were testing "exceptional athletic abilities" would you select a subject who played softball once a year and "believed he was athletic to some degree" or would you select a professional athlete?  For remote viewing, you could select members of the Hawaii Remote Viewers' Guild, for example.  Their intent was not to study the phenomena using an open-minded scientific approach, but to "debunk" it - in the typical sarcastic style 
 This book is WAY past its pull date.  Full of warnings about not calling back the unrecognized number on your pager (pager?), the ease of using a consumer-grade scanner to evesdrop your cell phone calls (not since the cell network went digital!), and how you should shred paperwork with identifying information on it (duh!).  The over-riding assumption is that anyone with something to hide must be a criminal.  The reader is told to vary your hours, commute route, and habits so 'they' can't catch you, because you must be trying to get away with something.  For the rest of us law-abiding types, the message is "privacy is obsolete.  get over it."  Even worse, the author and the ghost-writer (this is one of those books by someone WITH someone else) must have been paid by the word.  It goes on and on and on, just to convey the merest morsel of a factoid.  But worst of all, the author is such a big shot, you're supposed to be really impressed with the names he drops and the James Bond-style exploits he pulled.  He walked right into office buildings after-hours and stole bags of trash!  He staked out the parking lot of the YMCA residence and guessed that the only non-hoopty in the lot belonged to the embezzeler!  He shoulder-surfed the old man in line in front of him at the bank to learn his identity!  Shaken-not-stirred stuff, you bet!  I have a lot of books on my shelf, and I don't mind reading a lot of pages to get a little information.  But this turkey yielded NO information of use, and so it went right back in the box and back to Amazon.  
 I've bought one of the 12c platinum because I needed a calculator in my office. I don't do financial calculations, so probably I'll use the calculator only to make elemental arithmetics, but I like RPN and the programmable features. Build quality is below expected: intro key responsiveness is different than other keys', the soft case finnish is bad and the support pieces are not well adjusted, so the calculator is slightly unstable.  With the tag price this machine has you expect to get a perfectly assembled piece. Disappointed 
 I had not read Danielle Steel in several years.  I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable.  I was very disappointed with this work 
 I was especially taken by Patterson's book on the sociology of Slavery. However, in this book he appears to contradict himself. Maybe. In his 1982 book Patterson tendered that Greek polis and Roman slavery ought not to be  confused with modern, capitalistic notions of freedom. If freedom was  yearned for by slaves and freedom indeed was a virtue aspired to  particulary by women and slaves, then, what of the paranome and operae  obligations, reciprocal obligatons that was part and parcel of first  century Mediterranean societies. Indeed Peter Garnsey and Richard Saller  have admitted that even while the Romans may have given their slaves  citizenship along with their freedom, this act was always undergirded in  the interests of the owner. The slave had to work out his obligations. Why  does not Patterson talk about these obligations, a social-anthropological  reality? Or, is Berlin right in stating that freedom as we know it is a  modern phenomena, something that Patterson himself observed in 1982,  Slavery and Social Death 
 I picked up this short crime novel 'cause I was in a rush and it had a nice blurb on the cover from George Pelecanos (one of my favorite writers). Well, haste definitely made waste for me, and I'm sad to report that Pelecanos gave me a bum steer. This story about a murder trial in Brooklyn is an utterly tepid and uninteresting piece of work. Part of the problem is that a lot of the backstory to the protagonist Giobberti, a 40-year-old homicide prosecutor for the District Attorney's office, resides in Reuland's debut, Hollowpoint. Apparently in that book Giobberti screwed up so badly that he was exiled in disgrace to the backwater of the Appeals Bureau. He also either then or subsequently lost his daughter in a traffic accident and his wife walked out on him. Now, some 18 months later, he is unexpectedly told to take over a routine case involving a teenager who killed a bodega owner in a stickup.   Already on the case is inexperienced junior prosecutor Laurel Ashfield, who's never tried a homicide. Most of the book revolves around Giobberti and her getting a feel for each other and the case. Almost immediately, Giobberti (and the reader) realizes there's something not quite right about the case, and it takes an awfully long time for the specifics to be revealed. Once revealed, the specifics end up being woefully uninteresting, revolving around the completely unshocking reality of cops and DAs playing fast and loose with the truth in order to put away bad guys in order to score political points. The theme of corrupt a corrupt legal system and bent cops has been exhaustively explored in film and fiction for over a century, and Reuland brings nothing new to the table here.  The author was himself a lawyer for the Brooklyn DA's Homicide Bureau, so the book does benefit from a certain authenticity of detail. Reuland is particularly strong in describing places and creating vivid mental images of the courtroom, apartments, bathrooms, offices, and so on. Unfortunately, the people moving through these spaces don't talk or think the way real people do. The dialogue tends to be so clipped and elliptical that one wonders if the author is trying to parody of pulp films. At one point Giobberti actually addresses Ashfield as "sister" and another character laughably tells Giobberti to "take your meathooks off me!" Worst of all, there's no suspense and no dramatic tension to be found anywhere in this entirely skippable book. 
 We got this in lieu of another similar one because it was in stock, but lo and behold it only lasted a week. Our son lays on his back and kicks everything in his crib, so when he kicked this, the knob securing it to the crib through the strap broke off. Luckily the broken piece fell on the floor and not into his crib, where it could have posed a choking hazard! Pass on this and get a Fisher Price one - Ocean Wonders or the one we got, Flutterbye Dreams, which he loves 
 I really had to work hard to finish this book.  It was a stuggle in the beginning to keep up with the characters and the plot, though by about 3/4 of the way through, it finally started to make sense.  It wasn't my favorite Ludlum book 
 We purchased this for our daughter after she loved the original ballet version so much. I expected the same quality of the original product and was very disappointed. The mat is very cheap and flimsy and my daughter broke the headset trying to get it on her head 
 We must be attained to truth in order to create a really universal brasilian literature; excuse me the prostitutes of the literary status quo, but Dom Casmurro is not a great book in order to be enlisted as a piece of the Weltliteratur as designed by Goethe. Under the look of millions of variables in level of superficial structure, this trivial narrative plays, in its profound stru cture, the ritual of the eternal victory of the richer over the poorest, maniqueistically, without any greater discussion, AB OVO. Machado de Assis, like other famous brasilian writer once said, was a "betrayer of the black people". Even being neger, Machado renegated his own race and mother - he let her real mother die in a Rio de Janeiro's favela without even visiting her - just to try a place on the short and elitist literary circle of his time. Machado de Assis may have his positive points as brasilian writer, but he is not compared to the thumbnails of Shakespeare or Cervantes, who he tries to mimic on Dom Casmurro. Machado de Assis is considered the greatest writer of Brasil just because he well served (and is still useful) to the interests of the oligarchy and richer elite of our country, Dom Casmurro is but a lie blinded claped by critics sodomized by the political orders of a retrograted state, these claps are blindly followed by we, the people, who is not incentivated to really try really great books. This critic of mine is not the only one, I invite you to read the books of Doctor Flvio Kothe, whose critics are more detailed and also studies the social-economic status of Machado's time; The opinions of Dr. Kothe are academic and well observed, and recognized, a proof of this assertion is that he is winner of important prizes, included one for the translation for german to portuguese of the book "Das Parfum", of Sussekind.

  "Football Digest" once voted week four's 1977 Monday Night game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears one of the top 10 Monday Night games ever played (and arguably one of the greatest Bears games during the post-1963 NFL Championship season).  What was even more significant than it being Joe Namath's last appearance as a starter (or the last time anyone would see Broadway Joe at Soldier Field, and no one had seen Namath in Chicago since the Jets 1974 win over the Bears for that matter) was the fact that Chicago's Bob Avellini threw 3 touchdown bombs in the pouring rain to beat "Hollywood Joe" (who was knocked out of the game by Bears LB Waymond Bryant and replaced by Pat Haden for the remainder of the season) and the Rams 24-23.  Not only a great moment in Chicago Bears history, but a great moment broadcasted by  ABC's legendary Howard Cosell.  Just one of the many great moments left off  the "Chicago Bears - The Complete History" double DVD release.  What you have here is a compilation of old VHS Bears highlights (most of which were produced in the 1980's by NFL Films) assembled together by the NFL Network and transferred onto DVD.  Making it abundantly clear to real Bear fans that it wasn't compiled by a "real" Bear fan.  This 2005 NFL production plays more like a propaganda film than anything else (meaning; this is what "they" want you to remember).  A history of the Chicago Bears through their eyes, not Bear fans.  I found it rather insulting to have to listen to some spoiled brats (Virginia McCaskey) banter concerning a game and history of a team she knows nothing about.  What i mean to say is; why couldn't we get some insight from say...Chicago Sun-Times columnist Rick Telander (someone who actually covered the Bears) than someone who sat in a luxury box and picked her nose, totally oblivious to what was happening on the field (the Dave Wannstedt era of the 90's is a clear example of this).  Even more disturbing was the "Bears/Packers Rivalry" segment.  Packer fans will find this more engaging than Bear fans, considering the infamous "asterisk" game of 1989 (Green Bay's 14-13 instant replay victory)  along with Jim McMahon's 1986 pounding into the Soldier Field astro turf are covered with a fair amount of detail.  Although...i'm still trying to figure out why those moments would be more memorable than Chicago's 61-7 slaughter of the Bart Starr coached Packers of 1980 (which by the way wasn't mentioned at all here).  Instead we're shown (Ditka's continuing "fullback" saga) William Perry's 1985 Monday Night touchdown as though that were the only memorable moment of the Bear/Packer rivalry concerning Bear fans.  I mean...who's highlight reel is this? For a more comprehensive view of this rivalry, pick up Gary D'Amato's "Mudbaths and Bloodbaths" book. Although a bit pro-Packer in places, a good read never-the-less.  And after all, at this point in the DVD...anythings better than watching Green Bay's Don Majkowski spike the ball after scoring a TD (against the Bears mind you), on a Bears highlight film no less.  The NFL Network and NFL Films continues with its barrage of lowlights and insults levied against Bear fans by showing clips of the New York Giants 47-7 mauling of the Bears (in color mind you) in the 1956 NFL Championship, but failing to show any highlights from the famous snow bowl of 1977.  This was an important game to the Bears and their fans. It marked Chicago's return to the post-season for the first time since 1963. I can still hear Vin Scully's "watch Fencik lower the boom" on New York's Jimmy Robinson in one of the most devastating hits in the history of the game itself.  Chicago won the game 12-9 (a classic nail biter) in the last frantic seconds of OT to capture their sixth game in a row and finish the season at 9-5 enroute to the playoffs.  But we're shown none of this.  Instead we're told how great Frank Gifford was before, during, and after a few clips of the 1963 NFL Championship victory over the Giants.  Again...who's highlight reel is this? Also, there was no mention at all of the Bears week nine game of 1977 (the game that started the 6 game win streak) against the Marv Levy coached Kansas City Chiefs (Bob Avellini's TD pass to Greg Latta as time expired to steal a 28-27 victory in the wake of another brilliant performance by Walter Payton) or the 1979 demolishing of the St.Louis Cardinals 42-6, to finish the season at 10-6 and secure a playoff birth (the day after "Mugs" Halas' death, and yet again...NFL Films failed to mention any of it).  And although it was humorous to see Abe Gibron's "wired for sound segment",  lets not forget...he never coached a winning team in Chicago.  Watching Gibron just reminded me of all those losing seasons after the 63' NFL Championship. And considering the absolute chaotic, mind-numbing bewilderment on the sidelines, it's a miracle the Bears won any games at all under Gibron's baffling direction. The only memorable Gibron moment would have to be 1972's Monday Night win over the Vikings at Soldier Field (the game in which Abe got carried off the field,...a huge achievement considering the fact that the Bears hardly ever beat the Vikings during the late 60's & early to mid 70's, and well...taking into consideration that it was a nationally televised game and  Gibron's weight (lbs)...it was probably the most work the players did all year). But even more poignant than that for Bear fans was the priceless blank look on Gibron's face, captured by the CBS camera crew during the last home game of the 1974 season. In the midst of a 5 game losing streak, a mere 18,000 fans showed up in the rain and sleet to watch the Bears Mirro Roder split the uprights in the closing seconds to clip the Giants 16-13 (known as the "fight inflation or conserve energy; stay home and watch Bears lose" game...only they won!).  But again...we're shown none of this.    Casual Bear fans will find this insightful and entertaining i'm sure. But real Bear fans will find this to be nothing more than an overpriced cheap VHS transfer of the same recycled  file footage NFL Films delivers whenever a Chicago Bears documentary is in order.    ...hardly a complete history.    olofpalme6 
 Since he is the famous writer and I'm just a reader, it must me be. But I find stuff written in the first person and the present time a nuisance. Having read almost all of Hiaasen's books, this one was like a cold shower. I sometimes actually doubted that he had written it himself 'cause often the phraseology is so totally not the Hiaasen I got used to 
 Sure enough, this books walks you, gentle reader, through some basic concepts of typography. But it contains too many explanations  of terms and too little analysis of what these terms mean. It is also short on practical advice. For a good introduction to typography, take a look at Bringhurst: The Elements of Typographic Style, which will teach you much more. Bringhurst's book also has the advantage of being small enough so that you can carry it around at school or at work 
 Mcmurry is a colourful and over-generalized textbook that presents the most fundamental concepts of organic chemistry without fully elucidating on their logic. Mcmurry's style is to induce learning of 0-chem via memorizing of reaction mechanisms, and other trivial components.  The only reason you should buy this book (same reason I did) is if your o-chem course is based on this; that being, this is your prescribed text. It is far too difficult to study organic chemistry with another textbook. However this may not be the case for this edition of Mcmurry. Organic Chemistry by Wade has the same chapter format, covers essentially the same thing but treats  the fundamental principles with more depth; allowing the reader to appreciate the finer points of organic chemistry.  One thing that irritated me the most about this book was that there is no appendix for IR frequencies of major functional groups, and mass spectra is barely covered. It is at best just mentioned...nothing more. Wade treats the interpretation of spectral data with more clarity and depth...something which is essential in second year chemistry.  All in all this book doesnt even provide a good grounding in the basics. When it discuses KMnO4 oxidatation, that at least should be a review of redox.   The chapters on Substitution and elimination reactions as well as further chapters in aromatic chemistry are satisfactory, but it is the basics that are lacking. I would suggest for first time o-chem students to consult Wade and compare it to the writing style of Mcmurry. Albeit Mcmurry is very nice and colourful, you will regret its lack of depth and its over simplification of organic chemistry.  The book itself is supplemented with another spectroscopy book here in Australia, which suggests the severe lackings of this book. This has been inherent in it for the last three editions...Not too happy with it 
 Badly written book 
 This book was assigned in a graduate level international relations class.  While the aim of the book is laudable - to give practical solutions to foreign policy problems - the execution leaves much to be desired.  The editors make each contributing author shoehorn their essays into a rather clumsy outline.  There are countless "no **** Sherlock" moments when reading this book.  Overall, it is not insightful and an utter waste of time. 
 I worked my way through this,and kept asking myself why. This book is the product of a certain mind set in this country that props up certain points of views and tries to silence others, there simply is no other way to explain how this got published and, pick my jaw up off the floor, a movie made.  The writing is totally uninspired. Likewise the, uhh...plot. If there is a character, meaningful dialog, descriptive passage somewhere in this thing, please invite my attention. Swofford accomplishes only one thing: makes you real happy you don't have to spend time with him other than when you are struggling with his book. It doesn't matter how you feel about war, politics, life, or anything, this is just hard labor. Yes, I've done my time in the military and in combat. Swofford can't tell anyone anything, about the Corps, any military, combat, life, or putting one foot in front of another each day. Sadly, I think that this is a tragedy, because he had the opportunity to experience much, some of it even positve, but he missed it all. The people who put their names on the cover of this book and gave it favorable comment are dispicable 
 I'll admit it. The first three or so Cheetos actually taste pretty good. However, each one seems to taste worse, for some reason. And then there's the despicable Cheeto dust... You get that stuff on your fingers, and you're forced to either wipe it on something, (gross) or thoroughly lick it off your fingers (gross). I detest snacks with sticky dust crap. This stuff is the worst offender 
 This is a terrible book. If you want to know the history of the Warsaw Rising of 1944 go somewhere else to find out. If you want 700 pages talking 'about' the Rising as seen by the Russians, Germans, various Polish groups, and all the different factions of historians and revisionists exploring the question of whether the Rising was a good thing or a bad thing, then this could be for you.  If you want to know what the NKVD did before and after the Rising, not to mention tedious recounting of details and itinerary of trips to and from Poland by various western intelligence agents (yet surprisingly little of what happened when they got there) this might have something for you.  If you want to know about the people who fought, their personal struggles, their moments of dangerous combat, their lives after the Rising, well, forget it. The author has a policy of reducing all the Polish names to a Christian name and an initial, eg: Stefan L. or Waclaw P. He also refers to them by their various nicknames and code names, eg: 'Bear Cub', 'Salamander' 'Nile' etc. Many of them have several of these names which makes it really difficult to follow who is doing what to whom. This reduces these people to cartoons, and makes them almost impossible to get a human feel for, or to cross-reference with any other books or sources.  Davies devotes 130 pages to 'what happened after', but if you can't recall who Stefan L. is compared to Stefan P. or 'Ludwig', or 'Wolf'.. well you'd better take notes before you get that far.  Davies' use of the term "the First Ally" to refer to Poland is fine the first time. You take the point that Poland was a founder member of 'the Allies'. When he goes on repeating it however it comes across as adolescent and petulant. Particularly since it is wrong in fact. Poland was the first fighter, the first victim, the first to show resistance after defeat. But their first ally was Britain, followed by France.  Davies main failing however is one common to many bad writers - he tells you something has happened instead of showing you the thing itself. There is a photograph entitled 'Vola in the wake of Dirlewanger' showing a scene of devastation that cries out to have it's story told. In the text there is only half a page which refers to this scene. Occasionally 'the devastation of Vola' is referred to as an example of how brutal the Germans were. But there is nothing which describes WHAT HAPPENED there. Who fought? When, morning? Evening? One day or twenty? Who died? How? Germans? Insurgents? Civilians? Who lived? WHO TOOK THE PHOTOGRAPH? History should be good journalism with an eye to historical context. This isn't even good enough for a high school assignment.  The book has three sets of photographs showing some of the thousands of people involved in the fighting on the various sides. 'Captured armoured personnel carrier' shows armed Polish fighters in a German 'half-track under a huge Polish flag - Stirring stuff, but who are they? Where are they? What are they doing? What happened to them?  On the opposite page a photograph shows a dead 13 year old boy-soldier in the arms of an adult comrade. Next to this is a photograph of a statue called 'The Little Insurgent' raised in the 80's inspired by young Cpl Antek's sacrifice. Yet the only time this is touched on in the text is on page 683 - talking about the statue, not the boy. We aren't told what he did, how he fell, why he fought, we're not even told HIS REAL NAME - just the nickname 'Antek'  Page 687 has the following: a "rush of publications in the 1990s covered .. numerous memoirs by ex-insurgents .. detailed logs of the battle trail of particular units ". "A day-by-day chronicle of the Rising .. first prepared as a series of radio programmmes enjoyed wide acclaim"  You would think that a book sub-titled 'The Battle Of Warsaw' would call on these (Polish) sources so that we English speakers could learn about the Battle of Warsaw.   If the author would like to let me know where on this wonderful planet he is I will make sure that when I throw this book it will be in his general direction.   
 Being a Mortgage Broker, when I saw the title I thought it would be a good book for my industry - wrong! This is the second Guerilla series book I have purchased and I have been disappointed with both. The title mentioned more about the business of Mortgage Brokers than the text of the book. The author put a few Mortgage Buzz words in the text but it had no real meat for the Mortgage business or any business. If someone finds this book a good buy then they should not be in business for themselves since the content is just simple common sense. Also, the big turn off was when the author compared Marketing to 'Good Sex.' That statement alone shows he has no class! Instead of putting the book on my bookshelf, I put it where it belongs - the trash!  
 I'm a huge Jeffery Deaver fan and until this book had never read one of his tomes that I didn't absolutely love. Bloody River Blues was anything but spectacular in my opinion and it was a struggle to even get to the end.   Character development was fair but not the usual style I've come to enjoy from Deaver. I never really knew John Pellam like an intimate friend and was only given tidbits of information about him. Along the way a few more scraps were thrown out but most seemed unimportant. Subcharacters were also underdeveloped - even the villain was so underdeveloped that when the identity was known it was anticlimactic. One of my favorite characters was the paralyzed cop but his story was often short changed - his doctor could have been developed to give so much more to the story but she never was and it left me lacking enthusiasm for the storyline. And his chanting, nutsy wife could have been fun but again she was almost mentioned in passing and nothing more said.   The main plot was fair but not something that would grab the reader and not let go. In fact, I kept putting this book down and it was difficult to muddle my way through it. The subplots were tossed in with no clear reason behind them. For example, the subplot that has John Pellam trying to sell his own movie script so he can make it into a film himself had me scratching my head and saying, "So what!" I really didn't care and didn't see what relevance it had in the big picture. The other subplots were similar and left me wondering why they took up page space.   Overall this book was just a tad below average but for a Jeffery Deaver book to even be average is a very unusual thing. His books usually grab me from the beginning and I lose sleep trying to finish them. If anything, BLOODY RIVER BLUES put me to sleep! I'd definitely skip this one and read anything else by Deaver.  
 If you own Elmo's world "singing and drawing," don't bother ordering this one. It is pretty much the same video 
 The content is good, but these aren't actually flash cards. It's a bound book with very thin pages and two words to each page. Studying with flashcards is best done by testing one's self with cards, slipping failures back into the deck for near-term review, and setting repeated successes aside. This isn't possible with a book. 
 Why would people spend their lives obsessing over issues for which there is no objective evidence?  A cursory review of the literature about the mind will reveal that dreams are random and without predictive or any other kind of meaning.  Certainly dreams can be about stressful situations in one's life, but they will be mixed with all sorts of extraneous things, people and events that have no significance...viewed properly, they can provide good light entertainment.    Simply put, during consciousness the mind has an inhibition system that is activated so that cognition can proceed in an orderly fashion.  During sleep this system is shut off and all bets are off.  That's all there is to it!  I am tempted to give this book a 1, but will give it a 2 because I don't think she's trying to be deceitful.  For current info, see July '05 issue of the mag, "Scientific American Mind. 
 A tank this small should only be used for a Betta fish. Any other fish will need a good filter, heat, and oxygenation. And still it is way to small to even be worth it. My advice to you is to save your money, and go buy a 10 gallon kit and have that as your starter aquarium. Then you can keep some realy fish. Also goldfish should be kept in at least a 30 gallon aquarium, so i even if you get a 10 gallon, please research the fish before you buy them 
 For the shear audacity of disobeying scripture this book and its entire series receives no stars. I cringe whenever I see God's word taken out of context, changed, perverted, detracted from, or added onto, especially by men who are supposed to know better. In God's word He clearly gives His opinion on fictionalizing His holy book:  Revelation 22:18-19 "For I testify to everyone wo hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book."  Proverbs 3):5-6 "Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar."  One way to be found a liar and receive God's rebuke is by fictionalizing (a dangerous form of adding onto God's word where He has not made us privy to His details and outcome of events) His words and prophecies. Fictionalizing the very last days before the Lord's return not wise, and reading the words of authors who do this just might be damaging to one's understanding of scripture and truth in that it can easily confuse the reader concerning true bible facts--especially those who do not have an understanding of scripture or who have never read it. The authors of this series are treading on thin ice, simply shown by God's own words of warning in His book.  The authors have taken serious license in adding onto God's words in their Left Behind series, creating doctrines that do not exist in the bible and that do not align with the teachings of scripture. There are dangerous views on abortion presented in the series, even among its "Christian" characters, which can confuse those who have a liberal mindset or who might not fully understand where God stands on these issues in His unchanging word. There are false representations of the Mark of the Beast that cannot be backed up by scripture but that are debunked by what scripture does say about it. The books also have a huge misrepresentation of the AntiChrist. He is portrayed nothing like scripture has indicated such a ruler will be.  At best, this is a disobedient human attempt at trying to add more detail and story to a time in history Jesus said would be the worst ever. The authors have gone far beyond author's license. We just are not allowed to do this with the word of God.  I urge Christians to read and reread their bibles and be blessed as the Lord promised you would be for reading the book of Revelation. "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it; for the time is near." Revelation 1:3  He has told us what He wants us to know. We don't have the liberty to add onto it or change it

 would you buy a used contra from this man?  Newt, genocidal maniac against brave little Nicaragua in the Eighties, driven from DC in disgrace, now wants to be our President and so comes up with this self-serving and shamelessly hypocritical piece of electioneering and political campaigning.  Newsflash: GOd does NOT approve of Newt.  Newt takes us like a pervert uncle pointing out the word God on monuments around the NAtional Mall. But Newt's policies and practices have denied and ignored the meaning of these very words there inscribed.  GOd said Thou Shalt Not Kill. Newt's dirty little wars from the eighties onwards have killed uncounted thousands of innocent people worlwide.  Newt is a shameless liar now to claim the mighty name of God, and has much to answer for.  For a more true theologian and truly prayerful Christian reading, please consult with the Reverend John Dear, SJ, in particular his Disarming the Heart, and the God of Peace.  Leave Newt for the gullible and eagerly deceived. Newt is an apocalyptic false prophet spitting toads. Nothing more. Trying to get back into national office the most shameless way. 
 Ok....we bought this book for the physics club so we could build some cool gadgets and what not. I completely agree with the other peoples review that the author just plugs his website through out the book. WHAT A RACKET!!! He GROSSLY underestimates the cost of building each product. For one of them called the "Two inch spark tesla" thingy...he says that it is a fun expirement that will cost approx. $25 dollars.....So he then goes on to list some parts needed for the project. Most of them are pretty easy to find. But three of them are not...they include a 400V square wave transformer, TWO 25Kv Pulse transformer, and a 300V SIDAC switch....now all these parts are very very very hard to find...(Dont count on radioshack or even your average electronics store carrying these things)...so i went on amazing1.com and i will copy and paste the following prices from his price list...  Chapter 15 - 2 Inch spark Tesla Coil with Timer  SIDAC - 300 volt Sidac ....................$9.95 28K074 - TYPE1PC Switching Transformer ....$17.95 CD25B - 20 kv Pulse Transformer ...........$16.95 (you need 2) PCLITE - Printed Circuit Board ............$9.95  which is more than 70 BUX!!!!....WHAT A LIAR!!!  in addition to the fact that a SIDAC switch is completely unnecessary. there are many cheaper ways to accomplisih this with out using a sidac....SIDACS ARE VERY RARE (as well as the transformers)...WHICH FORCES YOU TO GO TO HIS WEBSITE!!!!  in short the author chooses to build his circuits using rare pieces to force you to go to his website!!!  WHAT A CROOK!!!...  WHAT TRASH! 
 In the first 7 books, there was the same reader, now, with the mark, there is a new reader,  which is always a pain in the butt.  This new author also tried to imitate the accents of each person.  Not fun to listen to.  Add to this my opinion these books are nothing but poorly constructed religious porn 
 The amount of praise given to this work does not surprise me given that there is a widespread, yet subtle, socialist movement in America as well as in Europe.  Despite this, the book is a failed attempt at reconciling the ideal with reality.  Rawls commits one of the many age-old flaws of collectivism, attempting to force morality on immoral beings. Rawls' entire work is fundamentally flawed in that the hypothetical situation from which the entire theory relies, selectively allows certain knowledge, assumptions, etc. while conveniently eliminating others.  For instance, empirical evidence that shows capitalism outperforms other economic systems cannot be known in the original position.  This is profound when one considers that we live in a hostile world that requires nations to invest in security of which economic power is imperative.  Thus, capitalism may be a necessary injustice in order to safeguard liberal democracy.  If we compare the human condition prior to capitalism, one can see that perhaps a collectivist system that may contribute to capitalism's downfall is immoral, if it leads us back in this direction.  Consequentalism perhaps?  Despite this, the people in the original position cannot have this knowledge.  Therefore, information that is direly relevant to the construction of a social system in a hostile world cannot be used in determining its structure.  Somehow though, the people do understand the important of the right to vote, equality, etc. This is absurd and impractical.  Rationale beings need to analyze as much information as is available and pertinent to any decisions they make.  Rawls continuously attempts to explain his "tweaks" as rationale but it is obvious that they are all implemented in order to discount human nature and proceed in theoretical terms.  On a side note, Rawls' first principle calls for the right to vote, what would his state do if citizens began to vote for a more capitalistic system that defied his "justice"?  Iron fist?  Nevertheless, it is quite obvious what Rawls is attempting here.  In a hypothetical situation where we all have to fear being born without intelligence, strength, status etc. we will take the safe route and ensure ourselves the highest index of goods.  This may be true, or it may not (human nature seems to embrace risk taking) however this situation is irrelevant because of its exclusion of relevant information.  Hobbes for instance accepted human nature and the potential for a wide array of circumstances in his hypothetical Natural Condition.  While Rawls may have some strong arguments in declaring that his two principles are the epitome absolute justice, this does not mean they are practical in a hostile world.  Essentially, what Rawls is saying is that none of us deserved to be born intelligent, responsible, hard working, but that we were simply lucky in the natural lottery.  Because of this arbitrary distribution, he believes that we all must compensate for those unfortunate souls that were born unintelligent, lazy, and perhaps even immoral!  I'd admonish Rawls not to attempt applying his insane reasoning to the criminal justice system (Poor, unfortunate murderer).  If Rawls believes that the laziest, dumbest, and most immoral person still deserves a living wage despite not working, he has contradicted himself in that this justifies slavery, forcing individuals to work for other individuals without compensation.  This simply cannot be justice as "fairness".  Nevertheless, I'd recommend it to all free market advocates simply to strengthen their positions.  As a warning however, be prepared for a work that lacks brevity, organization, coherence, and most importantly, reality 
 After reading the reviews on this site, I was excited to start reading the new novel by Saralee Rosenberg. I had read "A Little Help from Above", but I have to admit, I can't remember a single thing that happened. I don't even remember if I finished reading it, it was that unmemorable.   Anyway, I liked the premise for this story-- Claire Green, a struggling actress from Long Island, NY, gets on a plane to Miami, FL for a photo shoot and to see her grandmother. An old man sitting next to her on the plane falls dead in her lap and from there a series of surprising secrets are revealed and interesting events occur. However, I don't think that Rosenberg did a very good job executing this interesting premise. The dialog is weak and very often downright cheesy, Claire is almost completely unlikeable (she's always wailing or crying or whining about something or another), and it seems as though all conflicts are resolved in two paragraphs or less (more often than not with a section of cheesy dialog that made me cringe). I couldn't really hear people actually talking like the people in Rosenberg's book, everything they said was too extreme. Emotional outbursts, especially between Drew and Claire, were very, very random and often made no sense at all.   I think the ultimate downfall of this novel was the dialog and the characters. The characters were annoying, fake, and most of all completely unlikeable. Interesting story and idea, but not a well-written or enjoyable novel 
 The debate over God and His existence/non-existence is perhaps the most intriguing discussion to occur among human beings. We all have inferences and ideas. The debate grounds all of human existence and its purpose (or accident) in existing onto a single slate. It was prominent throughout ancient history; and it still impulses a countless number of important questions: Why is everything the way it `is'? How did life really begin? Are we alone in the universe? Is Pauly Shore strong evidence against intelligent design? (Okay, I made the last one up) Suffice as it is say, no one book is going to fully convince and support a reader's belief/disbelief in God. The human mind, so enamored with stubbornness and pride, loves to resurrect roadblocks parallel to its own conceived notions, preventing vehemently a certain concept from becoming acceptable. "20 Compelling Evidences that God Exists" compiles all basic Christian belief and theory into one snuggly bunch, and while it is certainly admirable in intention, its execution, producing less compelling evidences as originally implied, generates possibly more doubt than solidification. Whether you are a Christian or atheist, Kenneth D. Boa and Robert M. Bowman's book will not sway you either way (or worse, it`ll divide you even further.)  If I were an atheist, this book would be laughable. "20 Compelling Evidences" is nowhere near as constructive as C.S. Lewis or Francis Schaeffer. The "compelling" evidence in the title is disorientation, and the book proves to be "simple" evidence and a preach-to-the-choir treatise. I was longing more for a thoughtful refutation of the atheistic mindset with stronger pro-God examples. Lee Strobel, author of the "Case for..." apologetic series, explains more or less the same content as Boa and Bowman, but with much more effectiveness. The authors may want to worry that if an agnostic were to pick out this book, he would not conclude Christians have nothing to offer. The book's "because the Bible said so" approach tends to alienate facts and amplify rhetoric; and it is the clear authors wrote this with a Christian audience in mind. Not to say that the book is not valuable, as opposed to something utterly futile like, say, a Dan Brown novel. I liked the concluding appendixes of each chapter suggesting further investigative reading into the book's subjects. It was the least the authors could do to cover up their own ineptness. 
 The clappy-happy endorsements of this book are unbelievable shills- like the book itself. Keep looking. There are much better books out there. And no, Heiman doesn't need it, and Tom Hopkins is definately not the pick of the litter 
 The main reason I bought this kit was for the label applicator, the software was secondary. Good thing that I didn't care about how good the software would be, because the software for this is, in a word, deplorable.  It doesn't have support for ANY other label sheets other than the memorex brand, which leaves you stuck with their labels. Its got some nice features in the software, but their poorly implemented. For instance, it can automatically resize an image to fit a CD/DVD, but if you've rotated it before that, the rotation is lost. It has a lot of minor quirks like that, and they add up to an annoyance to use this.  If you get this product, find a better labelling program to go with the label sheets and the applicator 
 Threads of Life is really disappointing. Shadows Fall once showed great promise. What happened? We get the same guitar riffs, same song set up and same bad vocals. Brian Fair has to be one of the worst and most predictable singers out there. Anyone who has seen them live (like me) can tell you that. Guitar work is good but we've all heard this before. Nothing new or innovative. Some solid but predicatable drum work. Do they have a bass player? Metalcore is on its way out.  Stick with "Art of Balance" or "The War Within". Or save your money and buy the new CD from Machine Head or Dark Tranquility. 
 My first read of a Jon Jackson novel, and after reading the reviews on here I had higher hopes than the book delivered. At times it was very good, well paced, clear characters and action and then it would wander of on some side road for a period of time. Given that the Detroit detective's name is featured on the cover, I kept wondering when he would appear. Well, not for quite a while and then the most interesting aspect of his life is his living arrangement with his ladlady.  I believe this needed more re-writing than it got 
 I was highly excited when i bought this book.  I am a very obsessed Led Zeppelin fan and was looking forward to reading it after listening endlessly to all of their songs.  If you are just starting with Zeppelin its a great book to read, but if you a huge long time fan, than i dont recommend that you buy it.  I already knew most of the stuff they said and the author lacks in explaining the actual meaning of the songs.  The 'analysis' is too short.  Ramble On only has one paragraph!! I was disappointed...the author is telling me some lyrics and some instruments that are used..its purely not enough..you can learn more by going on the message boards at www.Led-Zeppelin.com..and trust me i have.. 
 Paul Oakenfold, a name that will be forever associated with A-list djs.  this needs to stop.  i myself have been spinning for over 4 years, and i am very irritated at crummy djs being worshipped.  this release is a decent release for people who don't really know anything about electronic music or djing.  the mixing is less than good, especially on cd 2, where it is downright horrible.  the tracks are spun in too fast or not even at all.  the selection is alright, but nothing too exciting.  except for the drum n' bass tracks, the music is not intelligent in any way, and i usually like acid and goa.  i have to say that the only good release from oakey is the New York GU, where the mixing is still weak, but the track selection is absolutely amazing.  save yourself the money and get that one instead 
 I'll be honest, the last three novels have me thinking that Patricia Cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name- the "voice" the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels, and its very frustrating. Leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she'd been attacked by the pod people or something!  I hold firm to the idea that she hasn't been writing these novels. There is just no way 
 This book lacks insight and details. After a given test the author gives you his personal view of the test you just took but doesn't give you an interpretaion of your score results. For instance, who cares if you came in the 85th percentile on the "How Romantic Are You?" test when the author fails to point out whether that means that you are an extreme romantic or an extreme nonromatic. Or if that's a good thing or not. I would not recommend this book to anyone looking to learn more about themselves. The book is mostly fluff with no meat 
  I'm not sure what happened, but this project could be so much better than it is. It sounds like a rush job ( kinda like Destiny Fulfilled). I expected with their voices to hear soaring leads and tight harmonies on a more traditional slant, but still have their DC3 flavor. Boy, was I ever wrong. A lot of these songs are over the top and so far removed from the traditional versions that I don't really know what they are talking about. It is very commercial and materialist in content. It isn't really about the real spirit of Christmas at all. I used Little Drummer Boy in a Christmas play at church with a trio of youth singers and it was so incorrect with regard to content that I had to edit the song... the little drummer boy played for the Baby Jesus,  not the girls playing for the little drummer boy ( that is apparent when Beyonce says, ("...then he smiled at me, little drummer boy smilled at me.") Did she ever listen to the original song? It just doesn't measure up.  The first track...well, all the materialistic things she gets for Christmas just says it all. I really dislike that song and it completely missed the point... where are the other days? Guess she got it all in the first 4 days or so...  I just think they missed it big time on this.  Their attempt was weak at best and this project doesn't really showcase their true abilities nor capture the spirit of the Christmas season 
 I am a huge a Jurassic 5 fan, in fact they are probably the single biggest influence of why I started to like hip hop.  On this album nothing catches your attention.  The use the same formula that they have used in the past, but the execution of the songs sometimes seems forced.  A lot of that has to do with Cut Chemist not being there.  Nu-Mark is a good producer, but when he steps aside to let others produce the music you can tell the difference.  "Back 4 you" and "Red Hot" are really the only two good songs on the album. There are a couple of other decent tracks but nothing that is going to get stuck in your head.  Also the song with Dave Matthews Band is AWFUL, but J5 wanted to try something new, and I think that is an interesting artistic decision, it just does not work very well between these two styles.  This is by far the worst J5 album, if you want classic J5 pick up Quality Control, or their EP, each of these are defining hip hop 
 This novel deserves 5 stars.  I was given 44 Scotland Street as a Christmas gift. I assumed it was a "detective story" given the author's previous well known work. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the book was like nothing else I have ever read.  I have lived in Scotland and have visited Jenner's department store in Edninburgh, as well as some of the other landmarks mentioned in the book. I can assure readers who have not been to Edinburgh that the descriptions and the characterizations are very real, for example, the rivalry between Edinburgh and Glasgow.  Although it may be difficult for non-Scots to fully appreciate certain elements of the book, the characters can be found practically anywhere and in any time. For example, the narcissistic Bruce and the class-conscious Sasha. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and especially homesick Scots.  I can hardly wait for the sequel 
 The guy is a liar...where I come from that doesn't add up to much.  
 In this fine work of literature, Mr. Manovich illustrates that he can talk a lot about computers, even though he doesn't know anything about them.  He makes a plethora of fallacious statements, such as when he argues that all digital media must be discrete and contain only discrete objects, neglecting one can define a continuous geometry using discrete coefficients.  If his statment were true, there'd be no way to draw a circle in Adobe Illustrator, but I know I've done that before!  Read this book if you don't know what a computer is and won't mind misinformation presented to prove points that are stupid and worthless anyway 
 1998's "Lost in Space" is just a mediocre sci-fi movie that's full of plot devices we've already seen in droves of other sci-fi outings.  Nothing new here.  And we've already seen this exact same idea executed in the 1960's TV series.  Why do we need to see it again?  Just to see the improved video game-like visual effects?  But this movie only seemed to be made as a marketing ploy to sell toys.  They didn't even bother with a sequel, and the movie ended with a strong hint that there would be.  They really need to stop dusting off old TV shows for movie ideas, and start coming up with some original ideas again 
 If you want bad gourmet recipes, then this is your book. The basic information is poor at best, and the "fancy" gourmet recipes are not even good. When I begin to cook a meal, i'll look in the "joy of cooking", get disappointed, and go and find what I want on the internet. The recipes are what you would expect to eat in the early 20th century. This book should have stayed there. I'm sure your grandma loves it though! squid in ink sauce?! for real? c'mon 
 Okay, yes, I know the brand is Dr. Kracker and maybe that should have been a clue as to the texture of this product.  However, I have had flatbreads made by other companies that were actually the texture of a pita.  These are VERY crunchy and don't have a whole lot of flavor.  Additionally, they were shipped and arrived expired.  If you are shopping for a super-healthy cracker, this may be it.  If you are looking for a whole grain flatbread with the texture of a pita, keep shopping - this is not it.  My next venture for this product is to grind it up and use as bread crumbs on top of broiled tilapia 
 I am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...  Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn't work try being nice. I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me. Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife. 
 This is not the version of Pirates shown on Great Performances. It is a video of the actual stage performance in Central Park. The video quality, sound, and stage settings do not compare to the Great Performances version, which was superb. Very disappointing 
 The book is awful and the company behind it doesn't respect their customers. Buy any other sewing book 
 horrid movie. i can't believe how disappointed i am in this anime. i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad. but it's not. the little girl annoyed me so much. i just can't stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her. omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie. can't stop ranting yeah... for those who haven't seen it, you might like it like everybody seems to but... i would not recommend it at al 
 The first skit with Arsenio Hall was pretty funny but then the movie went to crap. I didnt laugh at any of the other stuff. Looks like they put the funniest segment first. What a waste of talent on bad corny writin 
 I'm good with computers and have used other architectural software, and this was most disappointing.  In fact, if I had not bought this on Amazon, I would have returned it to the local retail store with huge complaints.  It was difficult to install--buggy.  It had problems rendering a drawing and would often lock up.  The "objects" that you pull from its library can sometimes be opened and resized--and sometimes cannot.  Hardly intuitive at all.  Also disappointing was the way multiple stories did not synch up.  I had reasonable expectations for this software, but wish I had bought something else.  For $10 it would be a good purchase.  For anything over that, you are wasting your money.  Try another product, a demo first, or something.  But in my opinion this was a big waste of money 
 This book is awful.  I have read the entire thing, and it says nothing that is useful.  I have been in public accounting for 10 years, and i am now ready to start my own firm.  I wasted my money on buying this book.  I know it is tempting to buy, since the title is exactly what i was looking for, but trust me, choose another book.  The accounting Guild website that the author constantly refers to is no longer in existence 
 This is not a good album.

 It's summer, and my reading matter always lightens up significantly! I spotted this book at the library and figured, why not!  I know, I said never again for Danielle Steel, but the plot interested me.  How bad could it be, right?    Well, there's good news and bad news.  The good news is that the plot is different for DS, and held my interest enough so that, unlike Impossible, I actually finished it in one day.  The bad news is that this book seems entirely devoid of any attempt at editing.  The repetition is maddening. When reading becomes a chore, and you can skip entire pages and not miss anything, it's time to start some serious editing.    Here are some suggested areas of improvement:  - Shorten up the paragraphs.  They should not exceed a page! - Try spending a little more time developing the characters.  I couldn't "see" Sarah - when I read, I want to be able to clearly visualize the people and after hundreds of pages, I never had a clear vision of the main character - Pay attention to style. Every time she spelled out 30,000, I wanted to pull my hair out.  Small thing, but numbers over nine should always be written in numerals unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.  As I've written before, DS needs a good editor. This book could have been one of her best to date.  
 I purchased this movie as it was labeled an epic film and someone even compared it to the best love story since Gone with the Wind.  Give me a break!  This movie had an agenda 25 years ago, and it still comes across that way in 2006.  The rating of PG is a joke.  Please do not watch this movie with your kids!  It is certainly has a more mature theme than what you would think.  The plot is lame and I am sorry I spent the money on it.  I plan to get rid of the movie and exchange it as used somewhere where I can get something that is entertaining, this certainly was not.  I did not even reach the end of the first disc before turning it off.  For top names in the industry making this film, all I can say is they got paid a lot of money for nothing.  
 Are you guys kidding me? Half of the movie's soundtrack is missing! "Mi Gente" by Hector Lavoe, "Che Che Cole" by Willie Colon, "Muneca" by Eddie Palmieri, "Vieja Luna" by Celia Cruz & Johnny Pacheco, "Abuelita" by Willie Colon & Hector Lavoe, "Alma con Alma" by Ray Barretto & Adalberto Santiago, "El Todopoderoso" by Hector Lavoe and the best song of the whole freaking movie: "Para los Rumberos" by Tito Puente. What happened? Whose pockets were not lined, who wasn't paid off? This soundtrack offering is a joke! Get the Mambo Kings soundtrack, if you want good latin stuff. They are lucky I gave them 1 star. I couldn't give this less 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 I wasted my money on this book. This company puts out several guides. It's obvious they change a few words and give it a new title on different businesses. Example is Coffee Shop changed to Ice Cream Shop. Very generic, useless information. I would even go as far as to say it was a rip off 
 An incredibly bad film, whose only redeeming feature is Lana Clarkson, in (and out of) some skimpy outfits.  She's completely gorgeous, but even she can't save a disaster of a film.  Buy Deathstalker instead 
 I too was required to read this book in the 6th grade.  I couldn't understand how this book could be an award then or now.  I'm a huge Eckert fan, but this story just doesn't cut the mustard.  For a better Eckert book, check out Johnny Logan 
 I tried this and it didn't work. To this day I still am a smoker 
 This is the worst sociology book I have ever read, a complete disservice to the stuggle for women's equality and an embarrassment to the university which trained its author and to the press which published it. I was one of the subjects interviewed by the author. Her methods are flawed: she failed to interview both men and women working for the same institution, rather than simply in the same profession, making everything the men told her about their jobs worthless as scientific data. Her analysis is suspect: she didn't publish the full text of her interviews, but simply selected statements, leaving the reader no way to fairly judge the context or overall tone of the subjects, or judge whether these quoted responses were typical or unusual. Her conclusions are laughable: she found that men either seek promotion or do not. Men seek promotion in order to dominate and control women;  men decline promotion because they secretly despise the women they work with. It's too bad such an interesting and important subject could not be dealt with in a scientific way 
 I bought this and within ten minutes it failed.  I was completely dissappointed with this purchase.  I loved the concept, but the product is cheap and will not hold up to normal use.  Lesson learned 
 First off, Robert DeNiro as the monster. I saw him and immediately thought of Jake LaMotta or Vito Corleone. They didn't even try to disguise his accent and no-one ever explains why the monster sounds like he just got off the plane from New York. Second, Kenneth Brannagh was so in love with  the set that he forgot about story. Finally the scene where Elizabeth was ressurected was ridiculous. Frankenstien's shock that she's not happy to be back--burnt up, cut of and her heart pulled out of her chest-- was supposed to be touching but I laughed. We all know how great Kenneth Brannagh is but he got completely carried away here and the result was really, really, really bad.   I give it two stars for the pretty costumes and utter magnificence of Aidan Quinn's face. 
 When I found "Hour Game" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt.  But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as "The Winner" and "Absolute Power" could turn out such a dog.  Long, boring, and confusing.  I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an "aspiring young writer" to "help" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them.  It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin.  What a waste.  What a shame. 
 I have some of Ehlert's other books and have found them to be wonderful, however, I found that this book was so very negative and had some very terrible concepts in it.  Although the author portrayed activities that cats do, I was shocked to see them so boldly described in a children's book.  I teach preschoolers and would not want to read this book to my class 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 For anyone who is interested in present day Turkey this is a book that is very informative and interestingly told.  His subject -- a very complicated land -- is brought to life clearly and colorfully.    V. Gree 
 The first five minutes of the dvd was interesting; however, after that I found that I was forcing myself to watch it without a great deal of enjoyment 
 Let me begin by saying this book sucked.  It sucked so hard, I'm suprised black holes aren't springing up near it.  I only finished this book because I bought it and thought it would be wrong of me not to. (I only actually "read" about half of it, the rest I read on skim mode)  The writing was uninspired and I didn't understand the heroine.  At all.  She was apparently some wealthy New Orleans socialite who always dreamt of being a wife and mother.  But she didn't actually take care of her child.  Or clean her house.  Or have sex with her husband (he was having an affair with a fellow lawyer and was tragically killed in a car accident.)  I have no idea WHAT this woman did all day.  Except maybe eat icecream?  There were several scenes that annoyed me, but I think the worse was when Jonnie (Her name was Jonquil, which PLEASE.) decided she was tired of her late husband's study being dark so she pulls out a chair and rips down the drapes.  Where she leaves them piled on the floor until he maid comes into the room to see what's going on.  Jonnie promptly tells the maid to dispose of the drapes.  Does Jonnie have something pressing to do?  Could she not clean up the mess she made?  After that; I just sort of hated her and hoped she was hit by a bus.  I didn't much care for the hero, Cameron, either.  He seemed very one dimensional and like every other romance novel bad boy.  He was in trouble as a juvenile, yet he was really tender and sensative.  I will say that through his actions I had a better feel for his compassion and concern for others.  So, I guess that's a plus.  With Jonnie, I felt like the reader was always being told what to think of her.  You should think Jonnie is compassionate because she hired a nanny David (the dead husband) wouldn't have given her a chance.  You should think Jonnie wants to take care of her child because she says so (even though Jonnie leaves her daughter alone or with the nanny most of the to run off and be with Cameron.)  I never understood the title of the book either.  I still can't figure out what is opposite about the characters, and their attraction was tepid at best.  I don't recommend this book, unless you're stranded on an island alone and might go crazy with the boredom.  But even then, I would try coconut sculpture first 
 Sorry, have saved for my trip to the Far East starting next week 
 It's hard to believe that this book is meant to be taken seriously even though the author might be a conspiracy buff. The conspiracies range from the ridicilous to the completely absurd. Some conpiracies are even contradictory, USA faked all Moon missions or Neil Armstrong encountered a moon full of aliens and their structures. The book offers a lot of opinions and wild stories presented as fact without any proof. Belzer's fellow "conspiracy researcher" Jim Marrses theories presented in the book are the most absurd. The Moon is a spaceship built by aliens because it couldn't have formed any other way and its gravity is too weak to hold it together. Sounds really good, if you don't know what a Physics book looks like. Belzer also mentions many times that ancient texts are full of referances to aliens. The only proof being that, when you forget about the ancient culture's gods, rulers, complex mythology and take the texts and images completely out of context and forget about what real historians say, the images and text might talk about aliens. Belzer also says that aliens don't land on the White House lawn for all to see because they don't want to and sane credible people see aliens all the time but don't want to tell anyone. This kind of circular logic also proofs that pink flying elephants are real.         
 I'm more than halfway through this book and I don't think I'll continue any further.  It's more like a medical dictionary of illnesses and diseases rather than a preparatory book for couples who are planning to conceive. A nice title though... but the contents were not what I expected. 
 I have to agree with the previous poster.  This book just wasn't what I have grown to expect from Leigh.  I've read just about everything she's done and this is the first time I've walked away disappointed.  Anyone who knows of her August series would expect something of the same thing from her excerpt on her home page and from the back cover, sadly, there was none of that.  I fear that because Leigh is not writing under Ellora's Cave anymore that her books may continue to be toned down.  I do remember reading this book was pulled for revision last year.  I hope that is not the case, because her books are some of the best and hottest I've ever read.  However, if she continues to pull away from the less conventional I'm afraid she'll continue to disappoint some of her most loyal fans 
 At first I thought it was great. The cat likes it and loves to watch it clear itself. Now the cat uses it to poo but not to pee. There is way!!! to much cat litter. When it cleans itself it trys to pulls half the cat litter into the SMALL cardboard tray. I still have to clean the box once a week which I guess is better than three times a day. I guess our cat poos a lot. The poo does get stuck in the prongs from time to time and that is your que to clean the tray out. I also don't like that the cat really shuffles the litter around before he goes so it sets the sensor off and we have to shake the box often or just push the button to get it to run. That is kind of anoying. I think they really need to make some adjustments to the box but if you have an older cat that doesn't dig a lot or poop a lot then this is the box for you. Be aware though you will most likely have to clean it every week. I had to actually flip the lid around so the cat would push the litter away from the tray. He was helping push the litter into the tray so it would fill up clean litter and the poop would get stuck in the grid. All in all it's not to bad! 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
    The reason I bought Apollo 18 is because I liked the Oblongs and the Malcolm in the Middle theme songs they did. But, I just think this disc is incomplete. Half the songs are 10 seconds or less (the Fingertips songs) and most of the others are 2 minutes or less. Although the whole album is about 43 minutes, I just don't think most of the songs are songs. I do like some of the songs (My Evil Twin, The Statue Got Me High, See The Constellation) but there's nothing very special on this disc. Here's a rundown of the songs:  1. Dig My Grave- Well, they say 'Dig My Grave' a lot. Pretty bad lyrics and a VERY SHORT song! The song is okay, but I really think it's nothing special. Time: 1:08 Rating: 3/5  2. I Palindrome I- A lot of people really like this song, but I think it's nothing special. The lyrics are much better than Dig My Grave. I even like some of the lyrics. For example: "I am a snake head eating the head of the opposite side." It's probably one of the better songs on the CD. (There's not much competition.) Time: 2:20 Rating: 4/5  3. She's Actual Size- I really hate this song. There's nothing I like about this song. The lyrics don't make much sense and sometimes the music is impossible to listen to. Another short song. Time- 2:05 Rating: 1/5  4. My Evil Twin- Probably the best song on the CD. The lyrics are much better, "Who cut the arm off the voodoo doll that resembles a Republican president from long ago." The music in the background is pretty good. One of the few strong parts of the CD. Too bad it wasn't longer. Time- 2:36 Rating: 5/5  5. Mammal- I like the song. But at this time I discovered that most of the songs on the CD sound pretty much the same. Also, they almost teach science in this song. There's four chambers in the heart like they said and they tell you about blood cells. Time- 2:14 Rating: 3/5  6. The Statue Got Me High- Probably the best song on the CD. The lyrics are great and the song is catchy. This and My Evil Twin are the two reasons I'm not on eBay right now selling this. Very strong point on the CD. (Finally.) Time- 3:03 Rating: 5/5  7. Spider- Ok..... I don't know why they added a 50-second instrumental(sort of) song to this CD. It's a very weird song and I think it's PRETTY stupid. Time- 0:50 Rating: 2/5  8. The Guitar- Twist on The Lion Sleeps Tonight. Although its okay, I don't think it's very good. One of the many songs I skip when I'm rarely listening to this CD. Time- 3:48 Rating 3/5  9. Dinner Bell- It's okay, but sort of annoying. The lyrics are very annoying and they just talk about dinner bell doing the dinner bell thing. Again, it's short. Time- 2:08 Rating: 2/5  10. Narrow Your Eyes- It's pretty boring. There's nothing interesting or really different about this song. The chorus is really annoying and the rest of the song isn't too great, either. Time- 2:45 Rating: 2/5  11. Hall of Heads- Let me just say, the music of this song is just about the best ON the CD. But, of course, the lyrics are very annoying. Time- 2:50 Rating: 3/5  12. Which Describes How You're Feeling- Finally, the song lyrics are sung pretty fast. The moment I heard this, I thought, "Hmmm... this might be the best song on the CD." Then it ended. The whole song was just over 1 minute. Psshh... Time- 1:12 Rating: 4/5  13.See The Constellation- This is a pretty good song. The song lyrics are pretty good and the whole song isn't annoying, such as many songs on this album. I think this is a very good song, although not as good as My Evil Twin or The Statue Got Me High. Time- 3:26 Rating: 5/5  14. If I Wasn't Shy- Boring. Very slow and boring throughout the whole song. All it is is the singer telling people what he'd do if he wasn't shy. When you think about it, good thing he isn't shy. Horrible song. Time- 1:42 Rating: 1/5  15. Turn Around- Hmmmm...weird. The song is okay, but the chorus gets very old very quick. It's nothing special, just like the whole CD. Time- 2:51 Rating: 2/5  16. Hypnotist of Ladies- This song is actually sort of fast(compared to the rest of the CD) but it's still horrible. Time- 1:40 Rating: 2/5  17-37: Fingertips- All of these songs are just 10-20 second snippings that just say 1 or 2 words. Some of them are sort of funny, and this IS sort of a strong point of the CD, but they're short. Time- various times Rating: 4/5  38: Space Suit- Space Suit is an instrumental song and it's not very great. It's only okay, but apparently a lot of people like this song. I guess I'm not one of those people, because I find it irritating. Time- 1:36 Rating: 2/5  Okay, I'm through with all the songs. The major problem with this CD is that all the songs are so short and many didn't even need to be put on the CD. The average length of the song are 2 minutes and 9 seconds. That's just sad. I'm sorry if this album is just about your favorite album in the whole world, but I give it a dissapointing 2 out of 5 
 This book started really strong and started dying about half way through.  The first half flowed pretty nicely, the authors all had very close styles of writing that made it really enjoyable.  About half way through, one of the big characters just disappeared and became a minor one, the styles of writing changed, sex and violence suddenly were added in what seemed like a PG-rated book, and the flow of events suddenly changed and left you confused.  At the end, things seemed to make some sense, but at the same time your thinking "What?" Started strong, ended badly.  Too bad too, I really liked Booger 
 I did not finish the book (I got about 70% of the way through before I realized I could not bear to read one more page).  Maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better, but I doubt it.  This is the first time I can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book.  The characters were flat and plot went nowhere.  Please - there are million of books out there.  Spare yourself, and find something else to read. Anything. 
 I read in Manson's bio that the singer for this band was a groupie of his. And it shows. This cd is a clean, more innocent version of Manson's first cd.   Her voice is nice and catchy, but the content wont appeal to many peole over the age of 16. This was a cd that was made to get quick appeal and then fade away just as fast 
 This collection pales by comparison to others.  The number of selections  is half that of other offerings for the same or less money.  A much better  selection of more than 20 of the best Sousa offerings is offered on the  fine Mercury recordings of the Eastman Wind Ensemble 
 This is truly one of the worst books I have ever read.  The writing style is tedious and jumbled.  Jacoby has little sense of logical flow.  But more importantly, her historical research is TERRIBLE.  The examples are endless, but for example: *Jacoby argues that the Founding Fathers really wanted a strict church and state separation, but then goes on to only quote Jefferson and Madison.  So what happened to the many other framers, such as Washington, Hamilton, Adams, Jay, and so forth?  Oh right, they probably didn't fit her argument just so, so she conveniently leaves them out. *According to Jacoby, Lincoln never mentioned the Almighty/God/Supreme Being in the Gettysburg Address.  Clearly, she has never read this speech. *Jacoby also blames organized religion for helping slavery keep its grip on the country.  Essentially, Jacoby sees it as an organized religion v. freethinking issue.  Wrong!  It was a sectional issue, and people from both groups supported both sides.  These are a few examples, and her bad work on these aspects is enough to make one doubt everything else she says.  Additionally, her critiques of 'non-freethinkers' is especially biting, and serves to make her sound childish rather than educated.    Save your money and buy something else 
 I am assuming that a lot of people who might be interested in this are people learning NT Greek  and this review is intended for them.  I bought this after being very satisfied with the Loeb Epictetus.  (See my review.) But Aurelieus' Greek is harder and less elegant (more optatives, more vocab that does not appear in the NT, more eliptical expressions) and this translation is simply AWFUL.  Again and again I found I had to refer back to George Long's older translation to unpack the Greek, which defeats the purpose of a diglot.  Aurelius is still wonderful for Christians, but until a diglot with a better translation comes out, I would skip this and focus on other non-biblical Greek 
 This book came out at the same time that Judith Miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the NYTimes that lead the US into the Iraq War. Much of her reporting on WMD spurred interest in her book and increased its sales. I wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the Times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more WMD fear would increase her book sales 
 everything in this book is common sense.  There is really very little to learn from this, and it is overpriced 
 I found this book to be very limited in regard to content.  I was looking for more advanced techniques, or at least a more detailed study of actual methods for accomplishing what the title advertises.   The author could have presented the main points of this book on a few pages and saved us all the time required to read the filler material.  Just about any book you pick up about public speaking or personal communication contains the advice found here.  "Repeat the question - It gives you a few more seconds to think about your answer" is about as advanced as the info in this book gets 
 What Fat possum did to this album really blows!!  Tracks like "I got a friend" start out with a nice southern delta blues sound and then out of nowhere it turns into porn music.  The audio effects and computerized editing really messed up the original sound of Asie Payton 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  Not much better than ideas that could be obtained through a supermarket store magazine article 
 I have three qualms with this book:   1. The characters become so painfully annoying over the course of it's 175 pages that, by the time the story has completely unfolded, we just don't care about what happens or might happen to them.   2. The book takes the moral highground. This is perhaps it's greatest flaw; the narrator, David, is painfully opinionated on all that surrounds him. I know this is something that can never be completely avoided in a first-person narrative, but it could have been handled with a lot more grace than what Larry Watson has done here.   3. The story is uninteresting. Not meaning to belittle Larry Watson's talent as a writer, because he certainly has a knack for descriptions of people and place, but we simply don't care about the majority of the events that unfold.   Read something else; save yourself from boredom and disconnection. 
 of The Fast & The Furious movie and only 20% of the movie time contains racing, Simply the movie is an advertise for a Misfit car called 2005 GTO (a.k.a Holden Monaro desgined and produced in Australia) also released as 2003 Chevrolet Lumina SS Copue in the Middle East (I bought one before & sold it after one week only), This car simply not Pontiac or Chevrolet it's Holden and you can find alot of them in the streets because of it's cheap price as a sports car.  for more info. check: www.holden.com.au / www.chevroletarabia.co 
 The CARS were one of the most annoying, dumb, pathetic, lame, overrated, stupid, lousy, and awful bands ever came out in the 70's. Their lead singer RIC OCASEK sings horribly and sings like a baby. This greatest-hits album was a huge joke that each and every song is incredibly bad.  Their guitar playing is really bad. They are only recommended for loosers. Don't listen to the five star reviewers of this album and avoid CD's from the Cars, Nirvana, and AC/DC who suck. Listen to good bands like Foreigner and Dire Straits insted. ps.the cars are for babies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 My taste runs to P.D. James and Martha Grimes.  I picked this up hoping to find a new series.  It reads like a Harlequin romance with a body in it.  Everything aches - eyes ache, voices ache, the gaslights ache.  Hardened policemen speak in voices husky with emotion.  And everyone but the villain is so blindingly good hearted as to be disgusting.  Throughout the story the author keeps building up to a horrible impending disaster - something so much worse and more terrifying than a cave-in.  The disaster turns out, surprisingly enough, to be a cave-in.  Absolutely tedious. 
 I got through half the book. It is a small book but I guess I was bored with the fact that it either stated the obvious or it seems other investment books cover this information better...was disappointed in the way it read. 
 I have recently started reading James Patterson.  I have quickly come to enjoy his work on the Alex Cross series.  That's why I chose to try this book.  What a mistake!  I could not get over the fact that Patterson was attempting some form of cross between mystery and science fiction.  Obvious potential storyline (what happens to the parents of the children?) was lost for tiring character development.  It takes way too long for the villan of the story to come forward and actually play a part.  Then, when he does, not much happens.  It felt as though a quarter of the book was spent developing the feelings of two characters towards eachother and then maybe 5 chapters (out of over 100) spent resolving the problem.  Due to the excitement I have had in reading the Alex Cross novels, I felt it was difficult putting this book down.  Burning eyes and constant yawning fought me as I tried to search for something to happen.  Once it did, it was over.  I have never been so glad to complete a book and put it away.  I hope James Patterson does not venture down this path again 
 This would have been a great book if they had made it into a larger format and made the text legible! The type is so small it's nearly impossible to read. I'm returning it because it's useless to me as-is. 
 Ughh! I was so frustrated with the main character of March in this book that it made it hard to enjoy anything else about it. She was whiny and selfish and abandons all those who truly care about her. It was impossible to have any patience or sympathy for such weak character. You wanted to tell her to grow up and start putting her daughter's needs before her own. Instead, she puts her daughter's life at risk by moving her in with a sociopath. The daughter, Gwen, was very interesting and you felt so sorry for her for having such a terrible mother. I also enjoyed her "love interest", her cousin that lives with Hollis, as well as her relationship with the horse. For me, these were the only redeemable parts of the book 
 I read this book over and over to no avail. I finally called in our County GIS Agent to come out and show me how it's done. Learned the program in a few days by watching her. The book makes it somewhat confusing to comprehend. If you can learn this program hands-on, you're a lot better off 
 Michael Gondry has followed "The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" with "The Science of Sleep."  Unfortunately, the film spends more energy on the fantastic way it tells the story than on telling a story.  In short, we go through all these dreamlike images of hands that suddenly become huge, a dancing donkey or Bernal flying over a claymation-like cityscape, but that don't further the story.  As an actor, Gael Garcia Bernal is such a nice looking young guy that you seem to want to root for him.  However, he became increasingly strange and unlikable as the film went on.  Bernal won the Best Supporting Actor Award from the French Academy of Cinema in 1999 for "La Buche" and was impressive in "The Motorcycle Diaries."  As Stephane, he's more neurotic.  Sometimes it's hard to tell if he's asleep or awake; or in which world the big change in his life is supposed to happen.  Apparently, that change is supposed to be that he falls in love.  The film teases romance with Stephanie who lives across the hall.  I think we have the male Stephane and the female Stephanie's names selected to show a kindred spirit connection, but it becomes a bit confusing such as the film being spoken in Spanish, French and English intermittently.  Emma De Cannes who will be in "Mr. Bean's Holiday" this year plays Stephanie's friend Zoe to who Stephane is attracted.  This is an odd complication since it's never clear which girl Stephane wants; and he seems never to be able to make a decision.  Then you have Alain Chabat as the obnoxious Guy showing up at work and in bars with his one-track mind.  Chabat was nominated for the French Academy of Cinema's Best Supporting Actor award in 2000 for "The Taste of Others," but it's hard to see why with this one-note role and performance.  Overall, the film doesn't go anywhere.  Yes, it does make creative use of fantasy and absurd cinematic elements, but unfortunately they don't serve to tell a story.  At the end, I was glad the film was finally over.  Taxi 
 But not enough to explain any one process through. OSX users, be advised, most of the dialog boxes are Windows which you need a magnifying glass to see. 
 My tape cassette reads, "Updated for the 90's." Well, on this tape you will learn tired, worn closing lines that were old far before the 90's. My advice, get your hands on a book called THE ACCIDENTAL SALESMAN by Chris Lyttle. He also has a audio sales training products on this website 
 Writer spends two years with the team yet offers about as much "inside" information as a guy who sells cars down the street at Rodmans.  Obviously aimed at the masses, but a book like this has  a much narrower audience and the authour fails miserably.  Lazy writing, factual errors, you name it.  Where's Michael Lewis - Moneyball when you need him?  THERE was a book that was so in depth, so appealingly detailed it ATTRACTED the masses.  Holley was a lazy hack with the Globe, he's a lazy hack here, and he's now a lazy hack on the radio.  Somebody petition his editors for his notes so maybe we can learn some information we don't know besides Charlie Weis saying Patrick Pass can't play.  Save the money, send me an email and I'll give you the book for free 
 This is an eminently Catholic book written by a sinner in his young age, becoming a singer of the heavenly pleasures of asceticism, growing older. It is a long masochistic call to God for forgiveness of his previous sins in order to get eternal bliss.  Saint Augustine sees sins everywhere and every time. Every newborn baby receives a stamp `original sin' from his first day on earth, followed immediately by `Was it a sin to cry when I wanted to be feed at the breast?' All organs are sources of sin: the ears, the eye, the smell, taste (eating and drinking) and obsessively, sex (`better a eunuch for love of the kingdom of heaven'). The bodily pleasures leave him so terrified to loose eternal bliss that `Even in my sleep I resist the attractions'! Other characteristic cardinal Christian rules are: obey all authorities (`In his own kingdom a king has the right to make orders'), censure (`But your law, God, permits the free flow of curiosity to be stemmed'), and deep anti-science sentiments (`futile curiosities masquerade under the name of science and learning. The secrets of nature are irrelevant to our lives.')  One should think that `love thy neighbor' is one of his basic principle. Absolutely not. He is a profound sectarian: `the Manichees, I ought to have disgorged these men like vomit.' But, why is he so sure that he is right? Because of his faith (`not a clear view'), his faith in God and the Holy Scriptures. Saint Augustine's Confessions contain also rather childish reflections on the mind, the body-mind dichotomy, memory and, e.g., `the problem of space and God's dimensions'.  But not everything is negative in this book. There is the love for his mother and his young son. Remarkable is his vision that time didn't exist before the creation of the universe. As a former sinner, Saint Augustine knows human nature all too well; e.g. `Men love truth when it bathes them in its light; they hate it when it proves them wrong.' More importantly, he found a religious solution for the problem of evil: if God created everything, he is also responsible for all evil in the world. But God gave all human beings a free will. Every human being is individually responsible for his actions. (This is not the case for Calvin's creed of predestination). One should in no way underestimate Saint Augustine's influence on Christian and Western morals. Only for historians and theologians. 
 I had somewhat forgotten how Greg Bear wrote.  His descriptions of the  Jart are so obscure and long-winded, the reader may as well just turn the  page.  I found it annoying that Greg Bear attempted to invent even more  words in this book than Eon.  My largest complaint however resided in the  high number of typos, duplicated words, letters dropped etc that made the  reading even more disruptive.  It really looked like there had been global  replacements as the same errors were repeated.  While I'd admit that an  author is more concerned with flow, plot, and technical accuracy - the  editor should review with a little more care to the fundamentals 
 This review is for the audio version.  This is the first book I have read of this series.  However, this book is the fifth in a series and the main character went on and on about her ex husband.  This is after she has already remarried so I can only imagine how the first four books must have dwelled on it.  I thought the premise of this book was interesting:  catering a low fat luncheon for a cosmetic company.  However, the book was downbeat mixed with corny and I didn't care about any of the characters.  I also didn't like that the author would negatively stereotype people if they were physically unattractive.  The lead had a harsh personality and I would not want her to cater any event for me 
 I've read all of the books in the Susan Conant dog series and the first cat one as well. This one has similar good traits to the earlier books -- fun malamute facts, quirky characters, etc. -- but I have to say that the person revealed to be the killer had the stupidest motivation for murder that I think I've ever read! Also, one of the characters continually sprinkles Yiddish in his conversation and as someone who grew up in Miami Beach when it was a very Jewish area, I have to say that although the words were not used incorrectly, no one but a stage comedian like Jackie Mason would use them so incessantly in conversation, especially to non-Jews or complete strangers 
 I have been a design student for about two years and I purchased this book soley through word of mouth.  I approached this book as if I was a beginner, knowing that the book was intended for such readers.  However, as I read through the pages and completed most of the exercises, I realized that if I had been a true novice, that this book would have been extremely difficult to understand and very frustrating.  In sections such as dividing a square, the author unclearly explains how to find the center of a square by drawing its diagonals, but fails to explain how to find the midpoints of the sides, and instead, assumes that you already know how to do so.  The exercises are the worst part of this book.  Like a beginner, I performed each exercise according to the author's instructions.  However, I always ended up with distorted images.  An example is when the author asks you to duplicate a cube in each direction.  Unless you are a machine, your cube will not be perfect and your duplicated cubes would only come out distorted.  But that is why a cube is already provided for you in the book for you to work on.  However, it seems that even professionals are imperfect, for when you duplicate the cube which is provided in the book, you still end up with distorted cubes.  As a beginner I would have been extremely frustrated.  I even asked one of my instructors to see if she could perform the exercise and she ended up with distorted  cubes as well.  Not only were the exercises frustratingly difficult, but the book's soft covers did not make it a suitable workbook.  Most of the time you're asked to work from off the sketces in the book, but the pages are constantly bending as you're sketching in it, and the illustrator's sketches are not very accurate in terms of perspective and scale.  I gave this book 2 stars because it does indeed mention good points when it comes to design, such as visual thinking, perspective, the "box method", and lettering.  But those points are not thoroughly explained enough and the exercises are terribly presented especially for a novice designer 
 i must say, when i set out to read this book i was looking for a quick book of short stories. This book has two majorly poor qualities: the majority of it is not understandalbe and the other parts are boring 
                        I don't understand why many people entitle this album: "the best of Eric Clapton".For me,Slowhand is simply a "flat" album.....If you want the best Clapton's albuns, buy the following:Eric Clapton                           Live -The Rainbow Concert                           There's one in every Crowd                           Money and Cigarettes                           Behind the Sun                           Journeyman                           live-24 nights                           Pilgrim                           Rush                           One more car, one more rider.                           layla 
 They call it "visual therapy" but they use mostly words to describe the types of worerobes. If you don't know your style yet, reading this book won't help you much. If you know your style already, you will know all the common sense already in this book. I usually finish a book I startes. This one, I kept thinking I wasted my money and time 
 I personally hate it when songs are printed in different keys from the original recording, or they are printed in an abridged form. This is the case with this volume from the under appreciated Sondheim show "anyone  can whistle". Not only are the above mentioned problems present, but  one of the best songs (See what it gets you) is given a slow blues tempo  that just doesn't compare to the manic tone of the original. Granted, the  shows most famous song (there won't be trumpets) is included, but again, it  is in the wrong key and some of the lyrics are wrong. The mayoress' (played  by Angela Lansbury and Madeline Kahn) song "Iv'e got you to lean  on" (another toe tapper) is also presented abridged and in the wrong  key. Abd the lovely duet "with so little to be sure of" is  presented here as a solo, with the wonderful counterpoint female part  ommitted.  it is a shame that this show wasn't given a better treatmen 
 I was disappointed at all the four letter words, vulgarity and the mention of one night stands while he is  married.  I felt it was also degrading to women.  I love Richard Belzer as an actor but as a writer I was disappointed in the book.  Does he want his two daughters to read his book 
 Year of the Spider rocked, the whole album was awesome. This new album just doesn't cut it on any front. The lyrics are bad, there is no melody, there is no rhythm, and no power. It was extremely disappointing. After this album, I wonder if I want to hear any more of their stuff. This album was like another band or something... I wish it were better. They can be great if they want to 
 Hi, I don't say ToysRus is not a big firm, but if you buy thru amazon, be prepared to wait. I've been waiting for 35 days. Christmas has passed, new years has passed, still another 10-15 days for estimated delivery. So be aware. 
 I bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair, sensitive skin, which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation. This product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face, hands etc. It did not irritate her skin at all...the problem, the one and only problem, is the fragrance, if you can call it that. It stinks so bad, I did not want to go near her after I wiped her down...I had to give her a bath, it was so bad 
 This has to be my least favorite of my Kiyosaki collection.  I will sum it up for you...think and know the power of Leverage, Passive income is taxed at a lower rate than Earned income, and you gotta buy assets!  There, you can continue shopping 
 When I was introduced to Goldberg at a conference a few years ago, the first words out of his mouth to me were (almost a direct quote), "See, I don't have horns and a tail." Other than my name and that I am a journalism/mass communication professor, he knew NOTHING about me, not even my politics or whether I had read his book. The man doth protest too much, me thinks. I have read his book, and there is nothing like a completely one-sided book complaining about the mass media being one-sided in the other direction. If all of the mass media companies (which includes book publishers) were one-sided in favor of liberals (other than Fox, National Review, Weekly Standard, etc.), Goldberg wouldn't have been able to get this book published, let alone advertised, reviewed, etc 
 I found this book to be an ignorant one-sided look at the near-death experience phenomena.  I have no argument with the fact that it happens, or that many people have this take on the issue.  However, the author shot down every other possible logical explanation with heresay, exageration, and tried to cover up his lack of knowledge on the scientific aspect with psequipedalianism. 
 I know that I will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... This is one of only 2 books that I have ever read that I truly REGRET devoting the time to , but once I start a book I always finish.I don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this.  I just don't get it.  The main character was quite annoying to me and the story was SO SLOW and predictable I really just wanted it to end. I would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you I am sorry.   
 The CD was not from the Original movie scores. It was mostly orchestrated music. Overall I was very disappointed in the CD 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 There's the heroine, Brandi, who has issues with her parents - her parents divorced and she overheard a few too many cruel comments before her dad finally walked out.  She's so terrified of being in the same situation as her mother, needy and feminine, that she essentially repudiates her Mother and everything she has taught her to be (feminine, sweet, dependent) in order to become a self-sufficient lawyer who needs nobody.  Over the course of the novel she learns a lot of hard lessons - that the fiance she picked to be the exact opposite of her father is really a lot like him; that she has become like her father by rejecting and infantalizing her mother.  She has to face them, and make new choices, finding a man who will treat her right, re-forging her relationhip with her mother.  And she has to kick her father out of her life entirely.  The hero, Roberto, is not as richly drawn.  He's actually very hard to understand, and although his POV is scattered through the novel the reader never gets to see deep enough into his thoughts to understand his motivations and behavior.  His feelings about Brandi seesaw without any apparent logic; one day he wants no commitment and is all love-em-and-leave-em, and the very next day he's introducing her to the family and mentioning marriage.  His purpose in Chicago is a little unclear; he wants revenge of some kind, and redemption, but we're left to wonder what exactly that means to him - although this turns out to be easy enough to guess, and eventually I wondered how Brandi had failed to spot the obvious.  But really, so far, so good.  It's in the execution that things really go awry.  "Trouble in High Heels" does two things that make me instantly hate any romance novel:  (1) The heroine is always angry or snappish or bickering, and the hero finds this adorable.  There's a point after some minor trauma where the hero says something like, "Ah, there you are, snapping at me again - you must be back to yourself!  How delightful!"  I don't like heroines who have nothing nice to say, and I don't like the heroes who find them delightful.  (2) The book concludes with a lengthy grovel on the part of the hero.  I can't stand it when the high-point of the novel, the real proof of the hero's worthiness, is that he's willing to abase himself for the heroine no matter how persistently she rejects him.  On top of which, in this case I didn't think he'd done anything wrong and I had no idea where Brandi got off being angry.  But there's so much more.  Here's a typical example.  There's a subplot about how Brandi turns her back on ballet because her father thinks its worthless, and she says she hasn't danced since she was thirteen; except other times, she brings it up and is very proud of being a ballerina and is apparently still practicing.  The ideas are there but the development is poor and inconsistent 
 I bought the book expecting to read some scientific, logically substantiated arguments, about why belief is second-nature to humans. The topic is great and could not agree more with what the author tries to show: that belief systems have a biological root. Unfortunately, he doesn't show anything. As the reader below wrote, this is a cocktail party book. To that I would add that this is a cocktail party book to be discussed after you had a few drinks. The writing is sloppy. The chapters are haphazardly put together. There is not a single argument. There is no conclusion. It's a collection of facts which, yes, I believe--but doesn't the author wants to tell us that logic is better than belief, albeit belief is perhaps inherent to us?  One of the arguments on page 6 is wrong: The author writes that logical thinking involves different parts of the brain, a formal rule-based process and a complicated automatic process based on left frontal and temporal lobes. He means that when we are presented with a logically correct argument, if the conclusion is not compatible with, say, our experience or intuition or our beliefs, we tend to discard it.  To *substantiate* this he asks us to consider the following argument:  The premises are: 1. No unhealthy foods have cholesterol. 2. Some healthy foods are fried foods. The conclusion is: 3. Therefore no fried foods have cholesterol.  The author "guess[es] that [our] left frontal and temporal lobe belief system was activated, and so the conclusion seem[s] invalid". He continues, "but it is valid, logically".  Well, unfortunately it is not a logically valid argument. Think again: the conclusion does not follow from the premises. 
 Because the guy who initiated the project of writing the book is here at Rice, the rest of us are unlucky enough to have to use this book. If your class uses this book, prepare to go to class. All the time. That's because if you fall behind, the book does not do a good job of explaining things to you. Examples are generally vague and only apply to a few types of problems provided at the back of each section. A lot of the time, I'd find myself stumped on a problem, looking back, and realizing there was no example problem for me to get ideas from.  Yes there are lots of problems and that's good, in a way. But what's the point of having all those problems if the book never teaches you how to do them?  Furthermore, it is a poorly written book. Generally, reading through the book is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Literally speaking. You spend all that time figuring out what the authors talk about and once you figure it out, it was not even worth all that time.  So go to class. All the time. If the prof isnt that great, get yourself another workbook. I havent seen Schaum's but I'm pretty sure they'll do a better job on covering the topics than this text does 
 While the book is amusing, I highly doubt it is based on fact. I am not arguing the entire book to be false, but I did research (ended up doing a paper on it for one of my college classes in fact) on the so-called real Ten Commandments.  Technically, Kick is correct. The "Ritual Commandments" he listed are labeled in the Bible as the Ten Commandments. However, if he had read any other part of the Bible he would have seen that this was the second list given to Moses; the first one being the "Ethical Commandments" which we are all familiar with. Both of these lists, among several other decrees, were equally important to the people. Whenever referring back to the commandments, the ethical ones are always used. Plus, for Christians anyway, after Jesus all of the old laws were abolished. The Ethical Commandments were summed up in two laws: Love God and only God, and Love your neighbor as yourself. It only took me 10 minutes to read part of Exodus and see he was twisting the truth. If he can get such an easily researchable topic wrong, then how am I to have faith in anything else he says 
 what were they trying to teach me?   this book is intermittently funny, more often highly and dryly pretentious and snobbish, but more than anytyhing I find it very very creepy. Towards the end when things start to fall apart for Aimee, Dennis/Waugh achieves a combination of callousness and feeble wit that is so offputting to the sensitive reader, I can hardly believe the book made it to press without a major rewrite of the last few chapters. It would be one thing if it were much much funnier, but most of the "comedy" is of the "lost in translation" variety: nothing but xenophobia and looking down on those beings from a different culture and therefore certainly inferior that populate certain parts of the globe. haha those silly japanese persist in speaking their own language/americans women are all completely interchangable unlike our English roses! Didn't this guy also write "Brokeback Revisited" anyway?  I was totally embarrrased to be seen reading it in public when I took it to dinner with me one night at the little thai place!  the movie is interesting cause john waters certainly got the idea of edie the egg lady from this film (and not from the book. mom is quite different onscreen as conceived by terry southern and c. isherwood.( also liberace is fun, rod steiger is A M A Z I N G.                            
 Don't waste your money!!  Your kids can do a better job than he did 
 From the back cover:  Miracles do happen!  Award-winning actress Mary Steenburgen (TV's JOAN OF ARCADIA, HOPE SPRINGS) gives a solid performance as Ginny Grainger, a young mother who rediscovers the joy and beauty of Christmas, thanks to the unshakeable faith of her six-year-old daughter Abbie (Elisabeth Harnois) and Gideon (Harry Dean Stanton), Ginny's very own guardian angel. Ginny's wonderous experience will touch your heart and warm your soul in the timeless tradition of past Disney favorites. ONE MAGIC CHRISTMAS fulfills all your most treasured Christmas fantasies. Share it with those you love.  And my review:  I'm such a sucker for Christmas stuff. I probably own more Christmas books and movies than regular ones. So this review is not from a "Bah Humbug!" Scrooge. And I don't expect all of my Christmas films to be "happy happy joy joy" all of the time. My absolute favorite of all time is IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, which can be very dark in places.  First off, I don't think that the acting was bad in this movie. And the cinematography was pretty good as well. I made my judgment based on the content and the storyline, which, in my opinion, flopped.  What I really found annoying was the way Ginny, the heroine, was constantly being villified. For example, let me paint you a picture of her life: her husband was laid off and hasn't worked in six months. They have two young children. She's making minimum wage, and they're barely scraping by. They've also been evicted from their home (since it's owned by her husband's previous employer) and are forced to move in with her father-in-law. They have very little saved in the bank, and yet her husband wants to take out $500 to buy Christmas presents for the kids. She understandably balks at the idea. First of all $500 is way too much to spend on presents for just two kids, even if you're rich. Unless you want your kids to become spoiled! (Remember, this movie was originally made in 1985, so that number is even more outrageous. Plus, they have only one meager paycheck to live on and no house of their own. I think that she's being reasonable. But she's painted as the bad guy for not blowing a bunch of their savings on toys.  Then her husband wants to sink what little money they have into his own bike shop, and possibly go into debt to own his own business. Again, she's villified for being the only responsible one, and telling her husband that he needs to get a steady job with a steady paycheck. After all, they may need their savings to survive. This is not the time to be blowing it on dreams that may never pan out (and usually don't, since most small businesses fail in the first year). But no, she's shown to be a mean, cold-hearted witch for saying this. Grr. It was just so irritating. Yes, you want to give your kids a magical Christmas, yes, the husband has always dreamed of owning his own shop, but you have to be responsible, especially when you have children to feed the clothe. I don't think she was being a Scrooge for wanting to be a responsible adult (she did buy her kids resonably priced gifts, after all), but the film painted her as such.  And this film was so depressing. It felt like the world was constantly kicking this family while it was down. The happy ending was a long time in coming.  Also, I'd be very hesitant to show this movie to impressionable young children. I certainly wouldn't want one of my children to think that they can constantly disobey me, run away from home in the middle of the night, or talk to creepy-looking strangers in trench coats. That's how kids end up abducted or killed! Not really realistic.  I really expected better from Disney, especially when I really loved one of their other Christmas movies, THE SANTA CLAUSE. There are way better Christmas movies out there. See my list "Christmas movies that I watch every year" for movies that are worth your time and money. I don't recommend ONE MAGIC CHRISTMAS. If you're still determined to watch it, try to rent it first, or you might find yourself upset that you wasted your money, like I was. 
 I felt this was a highly disappointing and unsatisfactory book about an 8-year-old child who has autism. Kristy, the 13-year-old protagonist in this story baby sits Susan, whose autism is so severe that she does not communicate meaningfully. She has an extraordinary gift for music and can reproduce any song she hears on the piano. She does not play or interact with others.   Other kids soon learn of Susan's musical prowess and charge admission to hear her play. They exploit her talents until Kristy intervenes. Susan can also provide any given date and her mother explains that Susan once saw a perpetual calendar which sparked this interest.   Parts of the book reflected antiquated attitudes and misperceptions about autism. Kristy looks the word up in the dictionary and the definition provided was that it is a form of schizophrenia or withdrawal from reality. Autism is NOT schizophrenia and people with autism don't necessarily "withdraw from reality." Indeed, people with autism often feel bombarded with outside stimuli and develop coping mechanisms to "come even," that is to tone down the sensory onslaught that is so much a part of the autism experience. Suggesting that autism is in any way, shape and form related to schizophrenia has proved very costly to people with autism. Sadly, this kind of thing has caused many people with autism to be misdiagnosed. This in turn has led to many inappropriate treatments and placements being inflicted on people with autism! This kind of thing does not help anybody and has harmed many.   This book is not meant to be a diagnostic tool, but I wish autism had been defined in a more accurate way.  Rest assured, autism is NOT a disease but a neurobiological condition that affects sensory integration and communication based on the individual.  I for one am good and tired of seeing characters with autism being portrayed as having savant abilities. That only applies to roughly less than 10% of the autistic population and I can't help but wonder if this story just reinforces those stereotypes of people with autism to the neurotypical population. Same old tired tune, just a different performer.   To the author's credit, no promises are made. Susan is by the close of the story enrolled in a residential program for autistic children. I did feel the story was extremely weak. I also wondered why Susan was sent to a residential school as opposed to a day program in her area.   Read Ann M. Martin's "Inside Out" instead. That is a much better book by this author about a child who has autism.  At least James is a Beatles' fan 
 I love Morton Feldman. I have a lot of his music, and I especially like the Second String Quartet. Triadic Memories leaves me indifferent. It may be the performance, I don't know. But the music is boring. And repeat listenings only confirm my experience 
 Will not play once video was downloaded. I get the error message:  "can not play file, please try again later. error# 0x80040273" I made the exlusive give me call me back feature but the UnBox department was already closed, I was told the UnBox Saturday and Sunday 6-5 hours. I have to say I am impressed with the Call back feature. I downloaded the Unbox Beta now and am recieving email assistance to try to resolve the problem. Thanks Amazon UnBox!

 The design of this ice cream maker leaves a lot to be desired. Only small cracked or shaved ice will fit around the tub and the plastic lid is already showing signs of wear. 
 There used to be quite a few negative reviews of this product on here.  My review (and the other negative ones) have all disappeared.  I'm not sure why that is, but I feel I have to restate that this DVD isn't very good at all.  It's poorly produced with lame voice-overs and cheesy music.  I gave a copy of this DVD to my parents, and we couldn't even make it all the way through it...it's that bad.   
 Comedy?  Thriller?  Suspense?  I guess that these are all words or genres that you could use to describe this film.  I would use these words if I wanted to gloss over the true feeling of this film.  I would use these words if I had to sell this wallow-some film to a distributor who didn't know any better.  I would use these words lightly, because if I ever believed them the battle would be forever lost.  This was not a comedy.  It was not a thriller.  It definitely was not a suspense.  So, what was it?  After viewing this film I came to the conclusion that The January Man reminded me of a puzzle put together by a two-year-old.  While all the pieces were in the box to put together, sadly the infant size brain of the child chose to smash the pieces together instead of place them in corresponding orders.  Thus, you have a jumbled mess with wedged pieces of what could have been an overall beautiful picture.  With poor acting, a confusing plot that literally went nowhere and an ending that felt forced and premature, one can see that this puzzle is unfixable by even the best puzzler in the world.  If I were those involved with the creation, I would definitely be ashamed.  To begin, what was wrong with the actors?  Nobody seemed like they were giving 10% much less 50% of their effort for this film.  Even the great ones like Keitel, Kline, and Sarandon felt like they were walking through the motions with equally confused eyes and hearts.  Kline's New York accent faded in and out throughout the film giving us no glimpse of his actual character.  His role was never fully defined, so the other half of the time that we watch him on screen we just don't care about him at all.  This was one of the worst leading characters of all time.  Thankfully, a completely miscast team that seemed more interested in the money than actually "acting" backs him up.  Keitel was horrible in this film.  I am a huge fan of his body of work, but in this one he walked, talked, and gave those emotionless eyes a rest.  He provided nothing of value to this production.  The same can be said about Sarandon, whose character seemed unfocused and undervalued, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, who never really got her feet wet in Hollywood until Maid Marion arrived at her doorstep.  Alan Rickman was wasted, as well as the one-leveled voices of Danny Aiello and Rod Steiger whose only direction from Pat O'Conner was to yell.  In other words, if you are interested in seeing this film for the acting, you will be greatly disappointed.  Second, perhaps the acting can be overlooked by a strong story line?  WRONG!  This was the most convoluted script that I have ever seen Hollywood produce.  We spend the first forty minutes learning about an event that happened two years ago that is never fully explained anyway.  It reminded of those times that the teacher would say in class that we should all listen up because this wasn't going to be on the test.  Then why bother.  This set the spiraling downfall for the rest of the film.  This unavailable information also lead to some pretty choppy chemistry between the actors.  I never say Kline and Keitel as brothers.  I never saw the relationship with Sarandon possible.  In fact, now that I think about it, I didn't see any of the actors meshing well together because they were working with a script that was focused on all the wrong parts.  Eventually, The January Man gets so caught up on this secondary story that we find ourselves rushed into an ending and a solution that seems laughable instead of plausible.  We even have a villain that is so confusing that I don't even think he knew what he was doing in the film.  The final thirty minutes of this film were the worst parts of this movie, second to all the parts before that.  Whoever wrote this script must have just forgotten the basic rules of storytelling because nothing meshed well at all.  Finally, I would have to comment that the marketing for this film could feel like a cheated ticket to some filmgoers.  After reading some reviews for this film, I was expecting to find myself chuckling out loud at the antics of Kevin Kline and his spin on the world of investigation.  I was wrong.  There was no humor in this film at all.  Even when O'Conner tried to bring some in, it seemed forced and unhealthy.  I must repeat, this is not a comedy.  It even isn't really that suspenseful, nor is the thrilling aspect actually that thrilling.  I must admit that whomever sold this film to a company under the guise that it was a comedy should be awarded the "Best Salesman of the Decade" award.  Somebody believed this film was funny and even pasted a preview to it with the word "comedy" written all over it.  Someone sold the company a broken product ... hook, line, and sinker.  I just ask you to beware.  Overall, this film was horrible.  From the poor acting, the cryptic story that needed some form of decoder ring to understand, the passionless actors, to the harshly branded word "comedy", January Man proves that not all films should be made and that an advanced screen process should be used regularly.  I genuinely encourage you to skip this film.  No good will come of you watching this mess.  I promise.  Grade: * out of **** 
 It's obvious that most Neil Young fans are thrilled with him no matter what sort of dreck he comes up with.  But speaking as a long-time (since Buffalo Springfield days; I saw the first CSNY concert) fan myself, I have to say that this one just doesn't cut it. I saw Young in concert not long before this album came out, and he performed many of the songs.  These versions are poorly performed and sloppily produced.  And the album has no real point of view; despite the efforts to portray it as having an anti-drug message, it also contains such pro-drug gems as "Roll Another Number for the Road."   Young deserves credit for his ambitious musical reach, but this one, which was well within his territory, thoroughly exceeded his graasp 
 The book is obviously well-researched and the chapter on The Riders was interesting.  However, the author included a lot of details that just really didn't matter-as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts.  The photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book. My professor was able to bring Dr. Schrag to talk to our class.  He was a good lecturer-keeping the class' interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the Metro.  If he could make his writing style more like his teaching style, I think he would have much more success as an author 
 I have to say that I was not familiar with any Darkman comics, or had had any other contact with the character apart from this movie so I cannot compare the character to other sources. Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" Darkman prior to the film I have to say that the movie was quite a disappointment! There are the obvious comic book characteristics that one finds in these types of movies, like the Shadow, Batman etc, which is interesting.   Nevertheless, Darkman was quite a disappointment considering the make-up of the cast: Liam Neeson, Larry Drake, and Frances McDormand among others.  It is the story of a scientist who falls victim to a group of gangsters resulting in his horrendous disfigurement.  In an effort to exact revenge, he makes use of his latest invention in order to appear like his targets/victims....   In short, the acting and the plot are average (nothing great), while the dialogues are way below average.  The movie falls into the action/adventure/horror type of category.   The characters are, overall, bland and just plain uninteresting (e.g. Rick Anderson played by the "fool," Ted Raimi, from the Xena series). Though the potential for a good movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...   In a nutshell, it's not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it.  No masterpiece here... 2 Stars 
 Don't waste your time an money on this diatribe against the United States and our President. George Soros is at best a weak Socialist, and most probably is a true Communist - except that he has what he wants (money) and now he going to tell the rest of us how terrible our country is, and how we should live. I am sorry I contributed to his tainted wealth by buying this book 
 In our opinion this book is a poor excuse for scholarship. The seminal work by Harry Oldmeadow on this same subject shows what a scholarly work should be - thorough, balanced and properly sourced. Interesting that Oldmeadow isn't listed in the Index.   This book appears to rely on hearsay and an incorrect understanding of Traditionlism to concoct a sensationlist work that is a marketer's dream but a true scholar's nightmare. 
 Tired themes and characterizations plague this book and the quality of writing suffers (lack of complexity and depth). I wish Christian publishers held to higher standards for their authors. The reading level is only about 6th or 7th grade level. Hey, if you're looking for a readable novel for your preteen this might be a good one.  It *is* interesting, I just want more than pablum - I would love to see excellence.  Try "Arena" by Karen Hancock - it's closer to the mark 
 I didn't make it the whole way through this densely written and intimidating book, but I was absorbed by one aspect: its portrayal of the human interaction between Marx and Engels.   Karl Marx was a psychologically warped semi-genius who continually begged money and favors from his hardworking and enabling friend Friedrich Engels. Sometimes Marx would agree to write articles or essays that he couldn't produce - he manipulated Engels into ghostwriting, and still collected the pay himself.  I also found it interesting that Engels developed his ideas on the class system while he was in England, observing the human experience in industrialized Manchester, which was at that time economically depressed and in a state of social unrest, with a great disparity between the factory owners and workers.  Marx and Engels wrote each other numerous multi-language letters over the years, and _To the Finland Station_ does a nice job tracing this correspondence. It was interesting to learn that spreading their doctrine into Russia was sort of an incidental afterthought, but  I'm afraid I could not bring myself to sift through the intricacies of the development of socialism/communism.     This is a weighty book, and will not be of interest to every reader 
 While I've had the pleasure of hearing Don Campbell speak, his information is, sadly, quite flawed. As others have rightly noted, the "science" in this book is simply horrible and there are many with his comments concerning classical music. The fact that he also copyrighted the term "Mozart Effect" is also deplorable. Finally, this type of book is responsible for placing music and sound on the backburner at many research institutions as it falsely implies that the use of music and sound belongs to "new age" nonsense. As a rule, I cringe when I see that someone else has used this book as a reference to back up other poor research. 
 ...if you don't mind an installation taking about an hour and a half. The installation was much faster on our XP sp2 -- except that, after four tries and a conversation with tech support, I *still* couldn't get the HP software to run the fax software. (XP has built-in fax software, so there's a workaround, but I'm not paying over a hundred dollars for software that I can't install.) Since our old separate scanner, copier, and fax were working, and we got the old fax to work better with a new answering machine than the 6210, we'll just return it. And, yes, we also noticed the small ink cartridges 
 I bought this album because i loved their self titled debut. Unfortunately, it really is nothing like their first album. There is only a hint of bluegrass sound, Chris Thile's vocals are straying into an alt-pop sound, and frankly, many of the lyrics are painfully insipid. Too bad, their first album was (and still is) one of my favorites. If you liked Nickel Creek (the album) for it's unique sound, don't buy this one 
 50 years ago this woman would have been locked up in an insane asylum.  Anyone who doubts that feminists are retarded should pick up this book.  I consider many women intelligent, however after reading this "book" I seriously question that 
 This book starts out pretty good, with interesting illustrations to the concepts and ideas put forth (the milestone concept is very good), but pretty soon it becomes no more than a directed Bible study with Scriptural quotations trying to relate friendship with the church and how we all should be united. Very VERY disappointing. I was looking for some analysis of the importance of masculine friendship through an educated Christian perspective, and while some stories he uses are great, all I got was another glorified Bible study. Big let down.. 
 This book is one big ploy to get unsuspecting readers to purchase website and newsletter subscriptions from Trudeau!   "Author" Kevin Trudeau was convicted for credit card fraud and spent 3 years in a federal penetenary.   Beware Consumers: He obtained the card numbers from one of his snake oil infomericals! 
 "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" - the version I have is from 1955, and includes the original written Act Two, and the Act Two version Tennessee Williams wrote for Broadway.  That said, I found this play to be the worst Williams play.  I read "The Glass Menagerie" and "A Streetcar Named Desire" and I found both to be emotional, engaging, and thought provoking.  This play does not include any of that.  I failed to see the point, and I didn't understand the motivation for the cruelty shown to Margaret (Maggie).  I was very disappointed.  I do not recommend. 
 It was no help to me and seemed to not be up to dat 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
 This diet makes you feel weak, it makes you feel light headed, and it makes you hate fruit with a PASSION. Why don't you try eating only watermelon or grapes for a day and tell me how YOU feel...along with all of the other days being mostly acidic fruits that cause ulcers and the corners of your mouth to be raw from the juice. It makes you have diarrhea and stomach pains, and I'm sorry but NO AMOUNT of weight makes that ok. It's the diet of a compulsive eater and a bulimic, and I can't believe I bought into this diet. Ask any health expert, and they will tell you to stay away. You might as well fast like an anerexic , binge like a compulsive eater, and purge yourself of the food through taking exlax...it will have the same effect.. I am SO GROSSED OUT BY THIS DIET!PLEASE don't do this to yourself..I know you may see this and think...she just screwed up the diet and is mad at herself for it and is taking it out on the diet...I am not doing that, and I just don't want anyone to do this to themselves..I was reading a blog from someone who said that she got a severe condition because of this diet that has stayed with her for over a year now...Don't do this to yourself..I don't care how good fruit is for you...its not good in HUGE amounts and you can't live off of it...find another diet and be healthy 
 Unlike other James Redfield Books, this book is bordering on pure fiction or fantasy. This book necessiates your lgic and reasoning power to be supressed most of the times.   I feel that creation energy centres which the auhor envisages, is unimaginable for ordinary or even to readers who are familiar and advanced spiritual explorers 
 The movie starts off very slowly, with childhood episodes from Ashton Kutcher's character.  It's at least 1/2 an hour before we see the adult Kutcher, although he does appear at the very beginning for a brief scene.  The premise is good, and it has some good momentum in the middle, which is why I gave it two stars.  The shifting situations of his life and the lives of his friends are interesting and well done, but the overall story line is very weak, and the ending is dreadful and not supported by most of the rest of the story.  Also, the movie has too many tongue-in-cheek references to Kutcher's real life circumstances -- such as the reference to "tighty-whities."  They distract from the story, and make the movie more of a vanity vehicle -- which is too bad -- If you are not a Kutcher convert and are just looking for a movie, skip this one 
 I was surprised how much this book was lacking.  It didn't even contain names that I considered to relatively common. Also, it only lists a name under its most popular spelling (under that lising it will give alternative spellings but still...)  I ended up buying a different baby name book.  This one just didn't cut it 
 This was the first Collin Wilson book I read.  He has probably read a lot to write this book, but to anyone at least a little into the occult it is clear that he have no idea what he is talking about. If you are interested in this matter (the occult knowledge) as something you would read about but never, ever try to verify if it is true or practice anything, maybe this book is ok. But if you are serious about it and really want to know what true and what is fake, please stay away from this book.  He is so wrong about even simple things that could have been verified with just a few months of practical experimentation. 
 At the first time, I used this book as my reference in my networking area. But later I can not keep up this fully-prosed book anymore. At last, I had to change my reference book to another 
 Having lost faith and taken a skeptical approach to religion I was hopeful that this book would lead me into rethink.  No way! Tired and inaccurate, not a waste of time though as I found myself constanly jumping up with "That's not true." "What a jump!" and that's a downright fabrication! 
 This book was assigned school reading.  I found it rather boring and the language used in the story became annoying after a while.  Not recommended 
 I was disappointed in the latest Lincoln Rhyme mystery. The book had more twists than a Chubby Checker song and in the end they strained credibility.  Rhyme and Sachs are called in to solve a string of murders by a serial killer calling himself the Watchmaker. Rhyme has met his match with the Watchmaker, a meticulous killer who leaves nothing to chance and leaves few clues for Rhyme to follow.  Running parallel to the story of the Watchmaker, Sachs is also lead detective on her first case - a case that appears to involve police corruption. Sachs is juggling a heavy case load as well as rumours that her own father may have been corrupt. Ron Pulaski steps up to help with crime scenes and proves himself to be a smart and resourceful officer but ultimately it is up to Rhyme and Sachs to solve the case.   The book introduces Kathryn Dance, a visiting Californian expert in Kinesics, the study of body language. Dance helps interview suspects and witnesses and plays a role in solving the case. There is also a hint of romance with officer Sellitto which is ultimately left hanging. The information about Kinesics is interesting and Dance is a character that could have used more development.   The title of the book comes from a season in the lunar calendar, which is also a time of death. The book also contains a lot of information about clocks and time courtesy of the Watchmaker. There was some fascinating information, but at times the book was bogged down in historical details about clocks.  The book lurches from one plot twist to the next. At first it was exciting, but after a while it became tedious. NOTHING was what it seemed. Further I found Rhyme less likeable in this book - grumpy, bossy, pedantic and sarcastic. The only hint of humanity was in his fear that he may lose Sachs.  At times I found the writing clumsy. Deaver uses cliched adjectives in his sentences to describes his characters, such as,        "the handsome, sardonic and impatient criminalist" I found it trite to describe Rhyme that way.   This book is not as good as earlier Rhyme mysteries.  
 Mark Twain called the Book of Mormon "chloroform in print" and he wasn't kidding.  It is by far the most boring read I have encountered (I could barely get through it).  I am a woman of faith - faith in God and faith in Christ and I don't know how anyone could believe this rubbish.  PLEASE, anyone who is taking this at all seriously - do some research on the church.  Ask some hard questions (you will likely get a rehearsed answer, but it's worth a shot).    Joseph Smith was accused (and fined with a misdimeanor) of being a "glass looker" - hired by a man to help him find buried silver mines started and left behind by the Spanish. He would use "magic stones" that were placed in a hat to tell him where to find the location.  So convenient that he later found "gold plates" and used what he called the "Urim and Thum" (which, by the way are actually gemstones that were carried by the High Priests of Israel in biblical times) to translate these plates (he describes them as stones he looked at in a hat).    There are SO many myths that are told by members of the church "most men were SO distraught at the thought of polygamy", the age issue of Joseph translating the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith's actual role in polygamy (which really should be called polandry - when a woman has more than one husband...  11 of Josephs 33 wives were actually married to other men first and then married to him, having NEVER divorced the first husband - what's up with that???).. etc.. and the list goes on and on...  I am not disputing that Mormons take care of their own... that they are often kind people who have good hearts, I think that is all wonderful and if you want to join their church for those reasons that's great! Just PLEASE do some homework first and don't just rely on the "power of prayer".  There is a reason that Utah is the [...] capital of the USA (I'm sure every one of those people "prayed" about that big business decision - it can OFTEN be mis-intrepreted).

 I have read every one of Stephen King's books.  This was the only one that I have not read.  I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one.  The style of Peter Straub stinks.  Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about.  Stephen King has finally written a real clunker.  This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read 
 Bagemihl belongs to the genre of writers who write a great deal but convey very little.  His huge book is divided into two parts; the second part describes case studies of homosexual behaviors among several animal species, and the first part provides what could-with great difficulty-be called an analysis of these reports.  Bagemihl groups sexual behavior in terms of five broad categories: courtship, affection, interactions involving mounting and genital contact, pair-bonding, and parenting activities.  Such broad categorization risks confounding social interactions with sexual behavior, possibly leading one to mistakenly assume that a preference for specific social partners is a sexual preference for these partners.    Bagemihl alleges same-sex sexual partner preference in at least some individuals in over 50 bird and mammalian species, based on five types of interactions: intersexual competition for same-sex sexual partners, sexual interactions between the object of intersexual competition and a same-sex competitor, repeated pair-bonding with same-sex individuals or repeated selection of same-sex sexual partners, reuniting with same-sex partners following prolonged separations with opposite-sex individuals, and engaging in sexual activity with same-sex individuals in the presence of opposite-sex individuals.  Whereas these criteria are consistent with a same-sex sexual partner preference, none of them definitively prove a same-sex sexual partner preference, and an examination of the examples presented by Bagemihl reveals that the majority of the cases of same-sex courtship, mounting, and genital contact can be explained without assuming a same-sex sexual partner preference [see P. L. Vasey, Ann Rev Sex Res 13, 141 (2002)].  Besides, the large number of case studies cited by Bagemihl notwithstanding, his book cannot be used to claim that homosexual behavior is widespread in the animal kingdom because Bagemihl's case studies are drawn from a less than miniscule non-random fraction of the millions of animal species out there.    Bagemihl, failing to find themes behind homosexual behaviors among animals, offers a concept of biological exuberance, whereby homosexual behavior is pursued for pleasure and is a goal by itself that need not serve any purpose other than pleasure.  Whereas this may be true, it is difficult to believe that this could be the result of normal developmental processes.  Even among humans where much heterosexual behavior is non-conceptive, non-conceptive heterosexual behaviors typically occur as a prelude to or in conjunction with conceptive sexual behaviors.  Additionally, the pleasure that accompanies orgasm not only prompts heterosexuals to repeatedly indulge in conceptive intercourse but also facilitates pair-bonding, which would come in handy if an offspring results from the union. Bagemihl's thesis on homosexuality, within a paradigm that he calls non-Darwinian biology, is meaningless for species that are capable of sexual reproduction only.     On the other hand, whereas Bagemihl fails to provide evidence for a same-sex sexual partner preference among the animal studies he cites, it has been proven that homosexual behaviors and a same-sex sexual partner preference are natural (i.e., occur irrespective of human intervention) in some individuals in some breeds of some animal species.  However, nobody, let alone Bagemihl, has shown that homosexual behaviors are normal in some animals, i.e., result from development in accordance with design. Whereas the question of the normality of homosexual behaviors among some individuals of various animal species remains unanswered, a considerable amount of information shows that human homosexuality results from abnormal development, specifically prenatal developmental disturbances.  See a newly published book in this regard: "The Nature of Homosexuality: Vindication for Homosexual Activists and the Religious Right."        
 Let me just say, I'm not a Seattle scenester, I'm not illiterate and I don't like the Lashes.  Sorry!  I found a copy of this EP in the used bin at my local record store so I thought I'd give it a spin - it was only a couple bucks.  Needless to say it's going back to the used bin.  Imitating the Strokes and the Killers is really played-out right now.  What's the point?  These songs are derivative with a capital "D".  The world doesn't need one more moody-looking band with perfectly styled hair doing an inferior version of what's already out there.  The music itself is almost passable but the lyrics are really DUMB!  It's like reading a 12 year-old girl's diary.  Even my friend said "It sounds like these guys are about one year too late."  The Lashes are so derivative and unoriginal I almost suspect they were "manufactured" to be popular.  Absolutely soulless.  
 "The Last River - The Tragic Race for Shangri-la".......Tragic. Yes I'd agree that this book is tragic. Tragic that I bothered reading it.....tragic that I paid for it in order to read it.....tragic that Todd wasted his time writing it......tragic that I disliked it so much that I can be bothered writing a review. The warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket. "Advance praise for The Last River" it reads. In retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it. It seems that Todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be, and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal. So much of the content has so little relevancy to the story, that you soon tire trawling through it. This was my third Tsango experience. I do recommend the Outside documentary on the Lindgren expedition. "Hell or High Water" is not outstanding, but is worth a read, but on this book, my advise to Todd is please make this the Last River that you drag through the wringer 
 This is a terrible album, save your money for something better. Vocals are poor and the songs are forgetable. I was disappointed from the begining and can't understand how anybody can find anything of value in it. And I must add, that I am a big BB and Brian Wilson fan.    
 I got this coffee pot last Christmas and it worked great for about three months. Now it takes 45 min to brew 8 cups and it sounds like I live by an airport. I have cleaned it but that isn't the problem. I did have to buy a new one since I couldn't deal with the noise or waiting so long for a cup of coffee 
 I am a teacher at an inner-city school that struggles with the same issues presented by Kozol.  That said, this is the fourth of Kozol's works that I have read, and I came away just as disappointed with "The Shame of the Nation" as I did with the rest of them.  I am so incredibly sick of him shouting from the mountaintops that there is a problem with public education.  He acts like we don't already know.  He acts like there is some unseen solution out there that should be obvious to everybody.  Instead of pointing fingers and and complaining about it, why doesn't he use his experience and know-it-all knowledge to offer real, concrete and practical solutions?  Kozol is a classic Monday-morning quarterback pointing out the flaws in what everybody else is doing - but he doesn't get his hands dirty anymore.  If he is really as educationally omnipresent as he thinks he is, the least he could do is offer some solutions.  I've made four mistakes.  I will not make a fifth.  I have 150 underpriveleged kids to teach, and I can't afford to waste my time on another volume of complaints while he points out the obvious 
 I normally don't write reviews for books, but I had to for this one because it is so bad, as many others have said. I too am a Gibson fan. But I want the time spent reading this book back, I feel it was so wasted.  I almost put the book down, but instead I foolishly hoped Gibson would somehow tie all the scattered, half hearted events together in the end. As many have said, you never find out what this "nodal point" is. The payoff NEVER comes.  You don't get close to really any of the characters. You want to get close to Rydell, but there is not enough of him there. There is WAY too much jumping around.  And there is way too much of "look at what a clever writer I am" by writing incomprehensible "creative" prose.  I don't know why some writers - even great writers- fail to grasp the most important point about writing: It's the STORY stupid.   This book is a chain of events that are disconnected, unfinished and unsatisfying. Read some of his earlier works, sure, but don't pick up this painted mess, regardless of what the so-called reviews on the cover say 
 I am an Egyptologist who teaches an online course in Egyptian hieroglyphs to the general public. While this book is widely available, don't let that fool you into thinking it is at all reliable. The one reason it is available is because it is out of copyright and the publishers can print it at will and reap all the profits without paying any royalties. If Egyptologists had any say over it, the book would be banned, as it is completely outdated and wasn't even considered a good book when it was first published nearly 100 years ago. When I first started studying Egyptian myself, my instructor started off the class by writing "Budge" on the board and enclosing it in a circle with a slash through it. That's how bad this book is. In my courses, students use and like James Allen's book on Middle Egyptian. It's recently published so it is up to date, and is written in a way that makes Egyptian comprehensible to the modern reader. It's infinitely better than Budge 
 The unflattering picture of JFK on the cover of the original paperback edition of this book gives away the author's perspective.  The author tends to select anything he can find that is negative in order to demonize  Kennedy as a moral ingrate and ineffective leader. He also confuses a  sexual appetite with leadership abilities and qualities. One could place  judgement on Kennedy for these excesses, but then one would need to do the  same for a whole array of leaders who had trysts during their lives. If  there is any truth, it is perhaps that in the current climate of reporting,  Kennedy would have been exposed to the world. It is a question of how he  might have behaved knowing that the risks were immense. The writer truly  fails to give balance in this assassination- of-character biography. The  early biographies of Kennedy by his followers were homages to the fallen  leader but Reeves' biography does not have the balance or the intellectual  soundness of a comprehensive biography. We'll have to wait for a more  definitive biography by a respected historian who can give balance to the  talents, hubris and human frailties of John F. Kennedy.  This book is an  example of how NOT to write a biography. It deserves space on shelves with  Kitty Kelly's books and the horrible biography of John Lennon. It has the  same sort of National Enquirer approach even if with a long bibliography.  Reminds me of Calvin of Calvin and Hobbes showing his school report and  highlighting the nice plastic binder as a measure of value when the report  itself is far from brilliant 
 I have used three other brands of 16x DVD-Rs and none of them have been problematic with my new (Tivo) dvd burner. This is the first brand that just hasn't worked. These discs were a waste of time shopping for, they were a waste of time dealing with failed burns, and they were a waste of money. I am not even going to attempt to sell the unopened package in the Amazon marketplace since it wouldn't be fair to other buyers. For your information, I have had no problem with Sony, Fuji, and Verbatim 
 This is what the author goes on and on and on about in his book. He reminds me on the History Professor in the movie: "Tearing down the house" with Steve Martin and Queen Latiffa. It was sad to hear how his "I really want to help you guys, but..." is his main objective. I did like his readable style which was unique, but just hoped he would have had something more meaningful to say. 
 The argument here is laid down as follows: 1)  America is the dominant power and it is spreading its wings around the world. The world is angry about this and hates America. 2)  In order to appease the world America must change its policies to become more like the world.  The recipe here is like those in the 1930s who argued for appeasement based on the false assumption that democracy was dying and that Bolshevism and Nazism were the only alternatives, and Nazism would triumph and therefore should be first 'understood' and then appeased.  In this book a standard academic argues that we must appease the world, that we must seek to 'understand' genocide and the Sudan and that America must therefore never oppose genocide because those who commit genocide might hate America, instead America must appease all reactionary genocidal regimes that suppress human rights, from North Korea, to Iran to Sudan.  Terrorists hate America therefore America must learn from the terrorists and invite them to craft American policy so that it is in line with their goals.  America must never defend freedom and minorities because that is unpopular, instead America should side with the majority, even if the majority is set upon world conquest and the killing of all Americans.  In short this is a recipe for national suicide.  American policy was not popular with Adolf Hitler or Josef Stalin, and apparently not with Osama Bin Laden.  The ideas presented here is that America should have been more understanding of these monsters and that America should have crafter her policy to be in line with whatever the world majority believes.  Thus if the world is for bringing back slavery then America should support slavery. If the world is for genocide, then genocide must be the policy.  An extraordinary argument, showing that we have apparently learned nothing from history.  History should have taught us the opposite, namely that the minority has generally been correct, that the world worshipped Nazism and Communism, and that the world was wrong.  America was right to oppose these mass manifestations of national hatred.    A sad critique.  Seth J. Frantzman 
 I do not know why I bought this cd. Lousy 
 I know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common.  And some of the information was just plain wrong. I trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because I couldn't feel the baby move. It advised that I should call the doctor. When I did, I found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. Unfortunately I found this out after I had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong. I would not suggest this book to anyone 
 I expected to find this book stimulating and informative, but came away feeling that Dennett is vastly overrated and quite ordinary in his thought process, logical skills, and writing.  This book does not explain or offer a theory on -- as its title promises -- what consciousness is; it merely offers a lot of random observations on and stories about consciousness.  Dennett seems to start everything he writes somewhere in the middle of a conversation he has been having with himself; he doesn't know how to properly introduce a topic to the reader.  He begins the book not with an overview of his subject or a presentation of a thesis, but with a chapter on hallucinations -- a very specific area of consciousness.  I indulged it with the expectation that it would provide an entry point into a broader argument he wished to advance; instead it was just the first in a random string of narratives.    I suggest that in lieu of Dennett's writings on consciousness, one read John Searle or Robert Ornstein.  Or if you want an engaging, conversational style of writing on the subject, look into Oliver Sacks.   
 I enjoyed his other books much more, but that's probably because I have less patience than most. Too much running around in circles here for me 
 I have always enjoyed Johansen's books but they are getting pretty predictable with the female protagonist and the male protagonist at odds with each other, building into an obsession and her finally succumbing to his charms. Its the same story with her other female protagonists as well. Other than a little different type of killer, these stories are as redundant as a Victoria Holt gothic novel and I gave those up many years ago for the same reason 
 I really wanted to like this book.  In the end however, reading it was strikingly similar to getting my younger sister to describe the latest Harry Potter book.  It is disjointed, unorganized and consistently confusing.  The authors of this book can't make up their minds what to focus on.  The number of times they utilize the phrase "we'll get to that later", makes you want to scream to nobody in particular: WHY DON'T YOU GET TO IT NOW?!?!?!  This was a fantastically uneven and dissappointing read.  Too bad 
 When I first read Peter Drucker in 1982 I was bored to tears  by a pompous man telling us the pol correct. Unfortunately,  those who teach business are not those good at practicing  it. In fact, many of them loathe it and seek revenge for  their own unemployability. Recently, with the advent of differential pay, we have faculty who don't even care, but  who switched form teaching operations in engineering, psychology or economics in liberal arts or even  biostatistics. This is why you don't see Drucker  (who proclaimed Japanese "participative" management  before it came into fashion - MacArthur deliberately  forced socialism on Japan to de-fascistify it) apologising  for the failures in Japan today. No, now they tell us  to emulate communist China, or the "knowledge" feudalism  of the university. Wait, didn't the university-style environment they promote cause Arthur Andersen and KPMG  so much trouble? Did they ever tell you that large USA  made cars weren't the problem in the 1970s, but that gas  prices made consumers buy smaller USA-name cars made  with defective Asian parts and yet somehow the peaceniks  who rebelled and bought "pacifist" Japanese cars turned  this into something else. Also, as USA education was deteriorating, our mechanics weren't telling us the  reason they preferred foreign cars was because they had  no clue how to upkeep the computerised USA carborateurs.  Now, as customer service has returned to 1970s levels,  did anyone mention it was caused by the inflationary environment, and the excellent customer service of  the 1980-90 era was due to low inflation, as inflation is intimately involved with mass paranoia and irrationality? 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 Janet Taylor Lisle hooks you in with a story that evokes the best of popular fantasy with some Pippi Longstocking thrown in.  Then she sucker punches you with a depressing dose of misfortune devoid of fantasy and stripped down to a cold, sad version of reality that shocks and confounds.  The denouement involves mental illness, neglect and orphaning.  For more on this kind of approach to youth literature, check out "Welcome to Lizard Motel" by Barbara Feinberg 
 I ordered Found 1 and 2, I expected some cute,sad,and sometimes heart wrenching reading material. I was very surprised to say the least. If the description of the book had include the phrases "excess profanity" and porn material enclosed" I would not have ordered them. I think you should warn readers that these books are XXX rated. 
 While I wouldn't expect a professional quality wheel for a child's starter toy, I would expect a wheel powerful enough to at least turn.  Even my daughter's 7 year old hands on a well wetted lump of clay proved too much resistance for this wheel.  It kept stopping dead at the slightest touch.  The lack of power will be frustrating to any child, and making a balanced bowl will be impossible. Kids would do better to form bowls by hand.  We took this toy back 
 Reading the reviews for this book I thought it would be a more substantial book than what I found.  It is a cute idea, but it is lacking in content.  Very disappointed...will probably end up as a garage sale book 
 I didn't care for this version at all. I thought there was no chemistry between the two leads, and there should be at least some smoldering of repressed emotions. The story was so abbreviated so as to seem just a conventional, brief story of thwarted love--the character development, especially of Jane, was missing in action. No heartbreak, no horror, no sense of Jane's virtue, tough interior and self-reliance, which helped her overcome so many of life's obstacles. Not even much atmospheric scenery. This Mr. Rochester, played by the usually-excellent Ciaran Hines, is utterly forgettable, weak, and miscast. He doesnt have to be handsome, but he does have to be powerful, passionate, sexy, and seething. After all, he keeps a mad wife locked in the attic and he tries to keep that secret while almost commiting bigamy. Instead, try the Timothy Dalton version which is excellent though now a little low-budget looking,  or the 2007 even sexier and faster-paced version with Toby Stevens and Ruth Wilson, which is outstanding and the best yet. It moves right along, and yet it keeps all the story essentials. 
 She seems to have been heavily influenced by both azuza street crowd i.e. much of today's pentecostalism/charasmatics i.e. the toronto/brownsville blessing (a history which is fraught with charlatans and very biblically problemic) and hollywood.   In studying many of her sermons what is readily apparent is the lack of any solid biblical understanding or doctrine. It was just get saved and jesus loves you. A cozy accomodation to the masses who can pretty much define that jesus they want to believe in and then follow.  
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with "S". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.  I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.  I would vote pass on this one. 
 As a PMP and member of a new PMO attempting to establish the value and credibility of a PMO within our organization I found this book to be a bitter disapointment. This book was singularly lacking in practical advice as the to implementation of a PMO. Regarding the subject matter, there was nothing "Advanced" about this book at all 
 This is a good book to have if you know nothing about nutrition and want to learn some of the basics. You can collect all the basic information here through general Internet research. True, it's nice to have it all in one place in a logical format, but I really expected much more detailed advice for a book targeted specifically to endurance athletes than 'you need to manage your carbohydrates over the length of the event'-type advice. Not worth the money in my opinion. 
 As the previous reviewer wrote, this DVD only shows the NFL Films version of Super Bowls IX, X, XIII, and XIV.  It does also have a short profile of Jack Lambert, John Stallworth, Chuck Noll, and a couple others.  They are only about 2-3 minutes a piece though.  The league season highlights are horrible.  Who cares about the other teams.  I bought this because it was supposed to be about the Steelers.  Wish I could get my money back. Gave it two stars instead of only one because of the profile on Lambert, he was the best 
 **1/2  There's a strange sort of paradox at work in "Remember Me, My Love," an Italian film that seems to be operating under some bizarre inverse law of quantum physics.  For while the movie itself moves at a breakneck pace, hurtling from one scene to another with near-reckless abandon, we can't help noticing that the faster it goes, the slower it seems.  Perhaps, we simply wear ourselves out trying to keep up with it and it is this exhaustion factor that ultimately accounts for our restlessness and ennui.  "Remember Me, My Love" focuses on a family of four, whose members haven't been getting along too well of late.  The parents, Carlo and Giulia, are both trying to find ways to cope with a bad case of middle aged crisis: he, by rekindling a romance with a beautiful former flame, and she, by pursuing the career in acting she abandoned when she became a wife and mother.  Their children, Valentina and Paolo, are typical adolescents, all caught up in rebellion, identity crises and complicated affairs of the heart.  Although the film attempts to provide some insight into the complexities of modern family life, the characters come across as so whiny and self-indulgent that any sympathy they might have engendered on the part of the audience quickly turns to indifference and even irritation.  The actors do their best (particularly Laura Morante as Giulia), but the characters they are called on to play never engage us much beyond the surface level.  This lack of depth is further compounded by the whirlwind nature of the storytelling, which rarely allows the actors the time they need to settle down and work out the subtle nuances of their roles.  In all fairness, I must admit that, in the second hour, the film improves considerably, trafficking in some genuinely raw emotions that exemplify the devastating effects that a disintegrating marriage can have on all members of a family.  Moreover, the film ends on a courageously inconclusive note, which goes a long way towards mitigating some of the theatricality and artificiality that permeate the rest of the movie.  Taken as a whole, "Remember Me, My Love" turns out to be much less than the sum of its parts, but the performances and a few good scenes do make it palatable.         
 This book was a big disappointment. Unfortunately, Mr. Leddick is neither  a scholar nor a very good story teller.  His work is poorly documented, and  provides little social context for the subjects' milieu.  I was also  disappointed in the book's failure to convey any historical context as the  bits and pieces of the subjects' lives were scantilly discussed.  Although  he succeeds in giving the reader a rough synopsis of the lives of Lynes,  Cadmus and Kirstein (at least covering the period of time that Lynes was  alive), he conveys little understanding of the artistic contributions of  each or how these men or their artistic contributions were interconnected.   The book makes it seem that the three were only "intimate  companions" through a loosely defined group of cocktail party  habitués, hardly a basis for a meaningful "triography".  One  wonders why Leddick chose these three as worthy of a joint writing.  It  appears that a biography of each would have included little material about  the others.  I would have thought a "triography" of George Platt  Lynes, Monroe Wheeler and Glenway Westcott, who lived in a ménage à trois  of sorts, would have made far more interesting reading, as would a  "triography" of Paul Cadmus, and Jared and Margaret French.   Instead, the reader comes away from "Intimate Companions" starved  to read a well-documented exposé of each of these men's lives and artistic  contributions 
 (What do Holly Hunter and Burt Reynolds have in common?)  Just another flick about a gal who falls for an abuser, this time with the gimicks of a waterlogged piano and exotic New Zealand Maori.   The tribe had it right, though, ignore these two losers and stick with the trees 
 Did you know that FDR knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor in advance and that he wanted Americans to die to get us into WW2? The author says it, though he fails to prove it. 
 I work as a stockbroker & currently study for an MBA at one of the business schools in New York. I was looking for an additional text on Finance to supplement my required reading list. I came across this book at a local bookstore last week & was quite impressed with the title...  As I flipped through, I found nothing interesting and of benefit for my MBA... How could this kind of low-rate work ever make it to the shelf?  What a piece of JUNK 
 There is not enough teaching on Hell.  How can you talk about knowing God with out full-blown explanation on the nature of eternal damnation and hell.  It's impossible.  J. I. Packer fails in a great way 
 This is an OK film.  It has none of the mystery, the art, the ambiguity, or the brilliance of 2001.  It's just a rather straightforward story.  It explains everything that happens in 2001, which isn't the point.  One of the reasons 2001 worked so well is there were no explanations.  It just happened, and you were supposed to let your mind and imagination interpret it.  And as some reviewers have noted, the bizarre inclusion of a Cold War, US/USSR military confrontation over Central America was short sighted, stupid, and now, terribly dated.  It wasn't in Clarke's original novel, and Hymas should have never put it in.  Of course, this was made during the 80's, where we were led to believe that the Russians are going to invade any day now (needless to say, they never did).  It is nice to see Keir Dullea and Douglas Rain reprise their roles.  The rest of the performances are good for this kind of thing.  If there was no 2001, this would be an OK film.  But it's really an unnecessary sequel.  Read the book, instead.  
 Gosh....., where can I start, I buy it combine with Complete Epic Series, I found it no much diffrent.  CES also have this episode.  Amazon should advice the customer clearly pertaining this matter before the customer buy it.  Now I'm facing difficult to sell it back to amazon due to the locality of my country (Malaysia) and its very difficult to find fans of BSG (old version) in my country in order to sold it off.  So should there any BSG fans in my country who read this, I'm willing to sell it around RM30.00 (very good condition)   I can be reach at : 019-756740 
 I have not recieved the book. I vant you to find out why te delivery is so slow 
 I bought the C. Crane FM transmitter expecting to broadcast from my computer and listen to it on an FM tuner with headsets as I worked around the house and yard.  It broadcast 5 or 6 feet, max, out of the box.  I performed the power boosting "fix" and now it broadcasts 10-20 feet, if I'm lucky, before static overpowers the signal.  This was a disappointing purchase directly from C. Crane that in no way met my expectations.  If it requires setting the transmitter on a grounded metal plate and lengthening the antenna in order to bring transmission up to whole house and yard capabilities, build it that way from the get-go or state the limitations of this transmitter forthrightly.  I kept the transmitter because I wanted one for the car.  It's physically well built and works fine for that.  I also use it to play my Ipod through a radio...but, understand, the radio is sitting right next to the transmitter.    If you want to transmit throughout your house and yard, look elsewhere 
 I had heard so many great things about this movie but it is just not my cup of tea.  I don't know if it because I tend to like more horror type movies or what but I was really bored by them.  Each of the movies started off really slow and they all ended basically the same way.  I know the whole theme is humans are trash but it would have been nice for a little more suspense.  The movies were violent but nothing one hasn't seen before several times so I am not sure about the shock value of it...I wasn't shocked, disturbed or upset.........just bored 
 the remaining of the REAL Mercury 7(Grissom who died in the fire before this book came out) called this book "fiction" and that Wolfe took too much license with this story. Especially how Grissom is protrayed in whole "hatch" issue. 
              Having read "The Clash of Civilizations," I was really looking forward to Huntington's new book as a scholarly, objective consideration of  challenges to "America's National Identity."   I ended up deeply disappointed.  My first clue was Huntington's handling (almost dismissal) of the issue of "separation of church and state."  Can one knowledgeable about that issue discuss it historically in an honest, objective way  WITHOUT mentioning Thomas Jefferson.  I hardly think so.  Being a fairly long-term member of Americans United for Separation of Church and State (full disclosure), I know something about that issue; and Huntington's treatment of it left me suspicious of how much I could trust his other portrayals and analyses to be reasonably objective.  	 I found myself questioning other depictions--for example, a "World Values Survey" of how much "national pride" is associated with "high importance of God" included no Muslim countries at all--in this work much pitting Christianity and Islam against each other.  	Huntington seems not to have been searching for any answer to "Who Are We? -- he'd already made up his mind:  America is " . . defined in large part by its Anglo-Protestant culture and its religiosity."  And the book seems focused on supporting, protecting and projecting that conclusion with a wealth of (selected?) studies and analyses and dealing poorly with alternatives and the "pros" and "cons" of each.  The book will be very well received by those of the neo-conservative/ fundamentalist Christian/militaristic viewpoint; but I don't believe they will learn much 
 Most military histories of the American Revolution focus on the "great" battles, and give scant attention to recounting other, lesser engagements. However, those lesser engagements are often the best way of depicting the harsh and divisive nature of the war. In the Carolinas, for example, the war took on many aspects of a civil war within a war, as Loyalist militias, stiffened by British soldiers, took on Rebel militias in a brutal, back-country partisan conflict.   This book attempts to describe that slice of the war by highlighting one engagement within it. That small battle, prosaically named "Huck's Defeat" (after Captain Christian Huck, the Loyalist officer who lost his life in the fight), was the first Rebel victory in the aftermath of the fall of the city of Charleston, and it is the opinion of the author that the importance small militia engagements like this one are overlooked. Huck's Defeat, and several subsequent victories by partisans and militia units, convinced most locals to side with the Rebel forces and oppose the English. This, in turn, kept South Carolina in the war, and ultimately led to the Rebel victories of King's Mountain and the Cowpens. The rest, as they say, is history: the British were forced to leave the state, marching down a path that led to Lord Cornwallis's surrender at Yorktown.   While making a good point - that these lesser back-country battles were important and are often neglected - Edgar overstates his case. "Huck's Defeat" was a very small battle indeed: 115 Loyalist and British soldiers vs. ca. 250 Rebels, and lasting no more than an hour. The loyalists were massacred, but unless the Revolutionary cause in South Carolina truly hinged on this one engagement (i.e. defeat would have meant the end of resistance in the colony), then it was simply one particularly bloody skirmish among many 
 This book is not good.  Where it could just give you concepts and syntax and an explanation of database structure, it goes on long-winded life lessons about how to interview people and other non-technical stuff.  Maybe I am just partial to technical references over process books, but there is almost nothing of technical value in here.  Written by a Microsoft guy, it continues the Microsoft tradition of hiding the computer from you instead of just teaching you how the computer works.  It's like trying to teach someone tennis but not letting them know they have a racket in their hand.  It describes how to swing in laborious detail, when it would simply be better to show you what you've got in your hand 
 Clarke is deservedly considered one of the giants of science fiction. In recent years, for some reason, he has been producing many collaborations, and in every one of them, Clarke's genius trips over the banality of his  collaborators. Why anyone thought one of my favorite books, The City and  the Stars, needed to be reworked, I'll never understand. How bad is the  pollution of Clarke's original? At one point in BTFoN the characters travel  to earth's moon. But in TCATS, we learned that the moon was destroyed  millions of years ago! It was a major plot point when the protagonist  discovered the reason that the moon was destroyed. Did Benford even read  the original? Does Clarke not remember it? Was the editor asleep? This is  quite simply a bad book 
 I returned the item because it was not exactly what I was looking for 
 This book is soporific.  I fell asleep every time I picked it up.  The opportunity for a meaningful and dynamic book was there but the promise was never kept.  Boring!  It is unlikely that I will read anything else by this author.  Give it to someone you don't like very much 
 To begin with, I was extremely disappointed after reading this book. I didn't expect something akin to Said's profound work, Orientalism; but this book turned out to be a total joke. It has a little bit of everything (Bahbah's post-colonialism, Marxism, Religious Fundamentalism, Lacan's psycho-analysis, etc.), but does not offer any insightful ideas why non-westerners have built hatred toward Western culture.   Somehow, it gives interesting discussion that the origin of Occidentalism is actually stemmed from Germany and Russia; but that's it. Extremely obsolete arguments regarding religion, god, sex, and "City of Greed;" with the absence of profound discussion about this aged, entangled gap between Western and non-Western world --to be honest, I would say this is total waste of time.  Occidentalism is not about "isms." It has to be carefully examined within the past and current historical context regarding what American and European governments did to the rest of the world in terms colonization and foreign policy.

 This is the all-time WORST movie I've ever seen! I can't  believe how stupid it was! How some people think this is great film is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY beyond me! It's a total snore-fest!  Plus it had way too much sexual humor!  Don't waste your time on this awful movie! 
 Not much new here. You would be hardpressed to get any benefit from this book. It doesn't grab the atttention of the reader.   
 It makes for a wonderful book when your toddler is going through one of those stages of just wanting to read the same book over and over and over and over and over b/c there isn't much for you to read.   I have to admit though that although I find the illustrations charming the whole premise is kind of creepy. I always end the reading with, "And then CPS came and took the mother away and placed baby with a loving, responsible family and Carl went on to star in his own TV show." I don't want my daughter being left with the impression that if we get a dog at some point it will be babysitting. I'm all for catharsis in children's books to show irresponsible behavior, etc. I think this one is disturbing b/c the parent is the one that's so horrible. The kid and dog are doing what one would expect 
 Got me started in the direction of Tesla.  Didn't realize that Begich was so much of a Bush hater politically.  Once detected political slant, I didn't trust further opinions 
 I ordered two soccer ball kits for my two young sons. They were unable to inflate either soccer ball on Christmas day because neither of the accompanying pumps and needles worked. If there had been no accompanying pump and needle with each kit, I would have been better prepared ahead of time to have my own pump ready. I had to go out and buy new needles the day after Christmas. We'll try again another day to see if we can inflate the balls with a different pump 
 This book is seriously out of date for modern web design and development 
 I truly am the target audience for this book - a novice. The problem with this book - the author is not thinking of the beginner. He jumps in and starts refering to components before explaining what each component is. You don't teach reading before you teach the alphabet. Sometimes a book needs to be edited by a novice and not an expert 
 A Dickens Christmas story is meant to be read in front of the fire with children gathered 'round. As configured in this particular ebook format you cannot do anything but sit in front of your screen and read ninety pages of nineteenth century prose. Not useful at all! This ebook would be far more usefull if, for example, you could copy or print it onto holiday paper. Since this story is in the public domain, blocking those options in this ebook is silly 
 I would prefer to give this book no stars. It is an outdated, sexist look  at the generalizations of men that no longer apply in today's society. I am  amazed that this book is a 1998 publication. It would make better since if  it was published in 1950. I am 25 years old and wanted to find out why my  husband is so different from me in certain aspects. This book was useless,  all it did was offend me, disgust me and lead to arguments with my husband.  It made me feel that I made a bad decision in being heterosexual because I  liked nothing about men and their ways. My husband read through the book  and talked to me about the inaccuracies and made me feel good about men and  him again. I would not suggest this book to anyone under 50, especially if  they are desperately seeking to understand their husband and are dealing  with minor marital problems. This book will only make things worse. Among  the many irritating statements made, my favorite offensive/sexist statement  is: Men's arms are built to swing an ax, while women's are built to cradle  babies. Give me a break! Someone needs to write a book on this subject that  is relative to this day and age. Women and men do struggle with their  differences and it would be so helpful to have an accurate manual to go to  for suggestions. This is not such a manual 
 I'm not sure Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel.  I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point.  The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes.  But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'.  Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations.  I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers:  this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers.  It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then.  Yuck 
 As a teacher, I read a lot of books about education and childhood development.  Real Boys is typical of most of these books in that the author takes 500-600 pages to say what he could have expressed in 100 pages.  Read the first chapter and you get the point of the whole book.

 I was sleepless and willing to try anything.  I mounted this device on a pole facing the the neighbor's back porch, where he left his dog all night to bark incessantly.  Despite all my hope, I couldn't detect any change in barking with this device deployed.  In fact, I had to abandon that side of the house until I hired a lawyer to pressure the neighbor to do something about his dog 
 The service was good but the product didn't have enough info for me to make a wise decision. At the end I couldn't use the product on my jabra ear piece. The item description should have information on compatible Ear sets to help make a better purchasing choice 
 Much of the material tracing the earlier history of Jerusalem is well written and quite interesting. However, when the author approaches the re-emergence of a strong Jewish presence in Jerusalem all of her previous objectivity goes out the window as she argues that the Jews brutalize the Arabs and that things would be so much better if only the Jewish majority were ruled by the Arab minority.  Her portrait of Jerusalem as a divided and armed camp on p. 419, "Repeatedly ...." is simply false. It is true that the area of Jaffa Road and King George is no longer mixed, but the commercial interaction between Arabs and Jews has simply moved to Talpiot. You also see many clearly identifiable Arabs at the three campuses of the Hebrew University and both Hadassah hospitals. The remaining area of commercial activity in Jerusalem is the food industry where in restaurants, hotels and grocery stores you see Arabs running the kitchens in most restaurants and running a large part of the operations of many of the grocery stores. I see this every day living here in Jerusalem.   The idea that Jews buying properties and moving into Arab neighborhoods constitutes an act of war has its parallels in the history of black people in the old south. It is a view of someone who rejects the idea that Jewish people are equal with any other people. How sad that the author has wasted her talents to present such a view 
 Author is extremely creative photographer, and book is well written.  Great for the amateur photographer who wants more from their photos 
 I should have purchased this book from the beginning!  What a savior it has been.  Shipping was quick and the book is in excellent condition 
 I read this book I don't remember how many years back. I think about 15 years ago. And just remembering makes me nauseous, for the amount of time and effort it took me read it just to get to no point. I was younger, naiver and I got engaged, I confess that. Clever Author no doubt, to make a huge pile of unrelated ideas and make believe you would get somewhere following his lead. Just wandering around and playing with analogies. I had the time back then, I guess. Today I only have the time to write a review stating how surprised I am today I could finish this kind of book. I can't speak for anyone else, suffice to say I was a nerd with a lot of time in my hands 
 The description and a review or two state the book is "revised and updated" but the last revision was in 1998. I bit on this line, a mistake, since I wanted to know about current methods.  Techniques change, materials and tools evolve. If you want info on the latest technology, pass on this on 
 Catherine Crier and indeed every defense attorney and state district attorney in the country had no doubts that Peterson did it.  Given both the evidence and his odd behavoir trying to flee the country and being caught in the process.  But this book is little more then a retold story of something that was already fully documented by those who took the case to court and won.  Thanks, but no Thanks Ms. Crier 
 The screws that come with the brackets are so soft they strip almost immediately --- was about to use my own, then read the review below and decided I'd be better off just screwing the furniture into the wall . .  
 what a load of rubbish - I very rarely give bad feedback as I know that it is easy to criticise BUT really this book is absolute rubbish.  Claims are made but not substantiated, putting a reference does not validate a claim.  The title is attractive and the summary compelling but the actual content insults any experienced marketing, or for that matter any business, reader's intelligence. If you want a laugh go to page 31 where the author says ""What happens when a "marketer pyramid" and a "consumer pyramid" come together...The result appears in figure 2-2".  Figure 2-2 shows two triangles with lines joining bits up BUT there is absolutly no content!!! - I laughed so much people sitting next to on the plane looked at me and I showed them the page. Five other people read the page and laughed at the audacity of what was being presented.  I will never buy another book from HBS Press. Where is the peer review? Where is the editorial control? Heaven help us if the current and future generations of HBS graduates are being taught, and accept(!) this garbage 
 I agree with other reviewers about positive points in this book, but what bothers me is the examples given : they all seem to be very special people : trainers, founders of training centers, vice-presidents of companies,.... This confirms obstacle 2 as given by the author : "only a few special people have true purpose in their lives".   I think we have a need for purpose in our lives, even if we are a gardener, a pizza boy, a cleaning lady, a sweatshop youngster sewing T-shirts in Laos, an office clerk doing standard routine work.  It is a pity that we find no such examples in this book.  From the book we get the impression that the only way to find a purpose is to quit our present job and to become a trainer, writer, etc...  but there are also other jobs to fill, I think.  Moreover, if everybody goes into training and/or writing, these jobs will loose their financial attractiveness, I suspect 
 Greetings to one and all.  Just wanted you to know that if you are looking for a pretty good film called "The Desperate Hours," this is NOT the one you want to watch. You want to watch the 1955 version with Humphrey Bogart and Fredric March. This is the 1990 "remake" with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins. The original is a taunt drama in which a man discovers that his home has been invaded and his family taken hostage by a trio of gangster escaped from prison and focuses on his desperate attempts to save their lives. This remake is exercise in terror in which the sadistic violence of the criminals becomes the driving force of the story and the goal is to see how far they will go before they are finally stopped. On paper you would have thought Anthony Hopkins could do a marvelous job in the role of the father, but the script pretty much makes that impossible. Turning the bad guy into a major league psychotic just destroys the psychological chess game that made the original so compelling. Rourke is simply the wrong choice for the role, always coming across as a sick punk rather than a criminal menace, but then few actors are going to be able to play against Hopkins, even when he is in low gear. I cannot believe anybody would watch this film twice; I only watched it because I was interested to see how they updated the original, the ending of which I just watched again on television. Of course the ending would be more violent, but it was the elegance of the ending of the original, as the hero saves his family with an unloaded gun, that made it stand out. This one is just a splatter flick dressed up a bit to fool you. Go check out the original because like Rourke's character, you do not want this in your house anywhere near your family 
 I generally like the quality of the products that I purchased on Amazon except this horrible so-called blender. It died after my second use, and even in my first use, it was smelling like it is burning. You don't even get what you pay for! It looks like cheap, but in fact it is expensive because you definitely have to look for another blender. This machine kills you for blending!!If you'll use it for a couple times and that's it, go buy it. 
 
 I bought this diaper pail because it used regular garbage bags and it was less expensive.  Well, I learned my lessen- you get what you pay for.  Like some other reviews the spring on my top broke which is supposed to keep the claw, if you will, closed after you put the diaper in and keep the smell in.  I changed the bag often but the pail still absorbed the awful smell and after cleaning it and soaking it, it still stunk!  I am now on my second child and decided to buy the diaper genie.  I hope this will work out much better 
 1) I went into this book without any previous education on the subject, but a genuine interest in learning about the Balkans 2) For the novice, this book is written WAY over your head (assumed prior knowledge, vocabulary) 3) On top of that, I felt that even if I had been up to speed prior to this book, it would have been just a BORING. 4) "A short history" incorrectly implies that a layman can use this book; maybe students would fare better 
 I purchased this book because everyone in the community was gaga over it. What I found when I actually looked at it was that all it is is a bunch of pretty pictures and that's the big wow. Sure, the recipies are good, but they're not "Oh my G-d!" like everyone is about this book. It's got menues and organization tips. All in all, I'd say that this is a good book for someone who is young and just getting married who has never had to cook meals before. If you are an advanced cook who likes to make your own menues, is familiar with other recipies that are similar, and enjoys challenging recpies, this is not the book for you. It was sort of a disapointment. It's mostly hype 
 When I had the privilege to study this work under Dr. Stringfellow, I was fed by a true student of the word of God. Dr. Stringfellow made the Bible come alive which made me want continue studying after he completed thre  study. I was able to go through the study a total of three time with this  magnificent man of God. I came out with a great knowledge of the word of  God which led me to further studying of the word of God. I would highly  recommend this study to any student of the word of God.After going through  this study, one can feel blessed by God 
 Alhthough Polsky has some interesting insights on the art market, they are relatively few, and are separated by numerous pointless anecdotes and even more pointless details.  For example, in describing a visit to a colleague staying at an upscale Manhattan hotel, Polsky writes that (in case he wanted to stay there in the future) he decided to ask a few questions of the concierge, "a moderately attractive young lady, who was wearing a very businesslike skirt, jacket, silk blouse, and matching bow." (p. 208).  Why exactly does it matter that the concierge was "moderately attractive"?  So we can gauge how excited Polksy was?  So the reader can decide whether he or she would rather stay at a hotel where the concierges are more than "moderately" attractive?  Notably, Polsky then does not even have any questions for the concierge -- so it appears that the whole event was not designed to give him an opportunity to find out if he'd want to stay there in the future (as he claims), but simply so he can decide how "attractive" the concierge is.  The book abounds in such pointless detail.  The author comes across as self-impressed to an extraordinary degree, and while his occasional insights on the art world are interesting, the reader must suffer through a remarkable amount of banal detail.  Not recommended 
 too thin.  my wrists wouldnt sit properly as there was not enough roo 
 The Book is just a info commercial at best, almost no tech help 
 I really wanted to like this book as I felt the subject matter was so timely for what I've been going through, as a single, childless, woman in her late 30's. However, like many other reviewers said, it mostly fell short for me. I've tried, multiple times, many of the things the author suggests. Much of the book was written for women with children, however, I did read the entire book despite this fact. I consider myself shy and there's even a chapter about that - but I gleaned nothing from this chapter that I haven't already tried without much avail. I do think the author means well and although I really "liked" her, from what I could glean as she wrote about herself, I didn't find this book to be as helpful as I'd hoped 
 This is not a book to buy if you are searching for good, clean funny reading.  I bought this book for my husband for Father's Day.  I read some of it - more than enough to get a good idea of its bent - then passed it to my husband with an apology and another gift to outweigh this disastrous purchase.  After he checked the book out, we both agreed the proper place for it was the trash can.  If you want a decent and truly funny book to read or to give your husband for Father's Day next year, you need to look for another book.  
 Musical scores were on spot, rich and compelling, imparting  emotional PUNCH! Chemistry was somewhat skewed between Kidman and Enman. The rule of "show don't tell" was broken periodically throughout dialogue, particuarly in Enman's dialogue when he goes from scene to scene "announcing" to each one he meets he's in love. Scenes were pleasantly varied, many of which were extraordinarily vivid and detailed with an interesting host of characters, however portions of acting came across as plastic and trained. It seems as though this movie tried to do "too much" and as a result the plot became vexed with business. A cornicopia of  scene effects, ranging from  surreal, to tragic, to tongue in cheek, to implausible (with the widow dancing and smiling shortly after she had witnessed losing her entire family to a massacre?) made it difficult at last to gain an emotional foothold and invest, although emotional offerings run like spooked herds throughout the production with the aid of ethereal soundtracks.  Speaking of implausible - The friendship that ensued  between the red-haired minister and Enman, in light of their initial conflict, seemed rather far fetched and silly, moreso with the minister commanding something more akin to a Broadway theatrical stage presence than a real person might portray given the strain of the times. Renee' Zelwegger did well but proved unbelievable for me in light of her typecasting and excellent role in Jerry MacGuire. Nicole Kidman was not in her element, yet even here in the role of a helpless swooner her acting credentials were present. This film was over-starred and substantially miscast. Didn't need Donald as Kidman's father and Kidman and Zellwegger's tension between themselves proved more distracting than complimentary. Overall the movie was interesting but lengthy to a fault. Undeniably a remarkable collaborative brainfest that in several ways might have been greatly improved. 
 This book is a pretty extreme children's story that follows the new religion of environmentalism.  Very anti-technology and anti- progress... no lawn mowers, no electric dryers?  We received this as a gift and I will not be keeping it.  I wouldn't read this book to my children 
 It's an entertaining book, it's a pity that the author has appearently done his research at 'Something Somebody Said Once University'.  The number of history blunders, plain falsehoods, and misinterpetations is staggering. It's a shame, because Mr. Allen has a great style. Not reccomended at all, I'm afraid 
 First off, let me say that I have read just about all of the Dragonlance novels.  Frightening thought, I know.  While I am not of the belief that the first three are gospel, I come to expect a bit more from a book.  In every trilogy by Weis (as well as Hickman in most) there are events and cliffhangers that keep you going.  Dragons sacking a city that everyone is in.  A building falling on someone.  Finding out the "true" name of the One God in the Souls trilogy.  There was usually something to keep you going.  Be it a question that was left unanswered or the state of a character that you have come to love.    This book has none of that.  In other trilogies, there are actually 3 minor stories that are built into a larger one.  Each book is its own work.  This book is built on one simple idea, what if Mina fell for yet another god.  She is one of a mere handfull of characters that appears in the novel, and remains as shallow and dimwitted as ever.    Rhys, the other main character, is really the only interesting thing this book has to offer.  Yet, he shows no action to speak of.  You get about a hundred pages of him wandering around looking for someone. Essentially, to wrap up what is turning into a long and (sorry) obnoxious review, nothing happens.  Pick it up a library sometime if you are interested, I am sure it will keep until the rest of this tale is generated 
 I've tried two of these travel chargers.  It's a nice idea.  I have some devices that can be trickle-charged by USB, so for my trip overseas I wanted to just bring one of these adapters and the device's USB cables to save space.  But the USB adapter caps did not charge my cell phone (Motorola L6) or PDA (Palm TX), so I'll still have to bring the full wall adapters.  If the AC adapter cap converted voltage, it would be great, but it doesn't.  If you could plug the AC adapter cap onto one end, and the USB adapter cap on the other, you could have a nice compact one-piece unit for travel.  Of course if the USB adapter cap doesn't work, what's the point?  It's still useful for its travel adapter cpabilities, but I am disappointed that it wouldn't charge any of my USB devices 
 This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.  Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.  This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this.  
 The quality of the pictures need significant improvement. As an artist you need all possible details for the best results 
 Remember the Kaiser Chefs (was it Chiefs? ah, who cares)? the Bravery?  Nah, of course you don't because they were empty garbage simply jumping on the "we think we're New Order" band wagon, and now that that one has burned down and blown away it's now awesome to be in a "we think we're Deep Purple, rockin' out all dirty and junk, bro." band.  Wolfmother are atrociously bad, I saw them on Letterman and I couldn't stop laughing at how shallow their music is.  This is obviously musical capitalism at it's best: chomping at the bit before the bit disappears and any chance for profits goes capoot.  This trash is just as bad as the Sword and Early Man 
 OK, I guess after 30+ years of generally spectacular music diamonds, everyone is entitled to plunk down a lump of coal.  That's just what this CD is..a dull clunky lump of coal.   I've been listening to Bonnie for most of those 30+ years.  I still have Streetlights and Home Plate on vinyl.  For the past many years, I didn't even listen to her new music before purchasing.  I just bought em!  There were always bound to be a couple "popular" hits and more than a couple undiscovered diamonds on in the tracks.  Not so for this CD.  I Will Not be Broken is acceptable...the rest of the tracks sound almost off key and in some places, even out of tune with herself.   Bonnie is still one of my all time favorite singers - but I wish I would have saved my $$ and not blindly purchased this one. 
 ordered size XXL for my brother for christmas, he said it fit great overall but it was too short! he's 6'5" and ussually an XXL sweatshirt fits just fine all over, including length. He loved the sweatshirt, so was disappointed that he had to return it 
 Professor Mack posits the existence of an anterior "book" to the Synoptic Gospels, "the Book of Q," yet he can support this supposition only through deducing such a creature through his own predisposed notions about what such a "book" SHOULD have been, and in tune with his own idea of a classless, pre-socialist fraternity, in which Jesus becomes a social revolutionary, a glorified teacher, but little else. If this is all there is to Christianity, then give me unadulterated Marxism or Fascism any day. Poorly argued, and obtusely expressed, to boot 
 "In My Country" is certainly a well meaning film.  Filled with dignity, it means to explore the atrocities committed in the age of Apartheid.  Can justice be served?  Can South Africa move on?  How complicit is the average man?  There are certainly important topics and issues to be dealt with--but rarely have I seen them served up so falsely and dispassionately.    Everything in "In My Country" is a construct.  You've got Juliette Binoche as the face of white shame, Samuel L. Jackson as black rage (though he's an American), Brendan Gleeson as the villain, Binoche's assistant as the tolerant and understanding African, and her boss as the face of white indifference.  Of course, this story is told from the vantage point of the white lady and the American--as these stories rarely examine issues from the African viewpoint.  Even the testimony of atrocities--which should be a dramatic highpoint--are so staged, so false with the requisite swoons from the audience at "shocking" revelations.  And Binoche is ever present to provide the tears--but as the emotion isn't genuinely developed, I continued to sit there feeling rather empty at the whole exercise.  The Africans are never portrayed as significant indivduals, but as understanding and forgiving souls.  I'd have appreciated a bit of emotional complexity at any point!  If the pairing of Juliette Binoche and Samuel L. Jackson seems an odd match, trust me--it is.  As characters with opposing views, they are put together rather conveniently.  No actual friendship is ever developed, we're just supposed to take it at face value that these two would hang out together.  Well, I didn't believe it for a second.  It was necessary for the plot, so it happened--why bother with actual character development?  There's a more important message to be delivered by having them debate.  Of course, to make matters worse--a romantic entanglement evolves.  There's not much drama there, either, as Binoche seemingly has an indifference to her husband and children.  If she's conflicted about anything, it certainly never shows.  And as if matters aren't bad enough, there's a heavy-handed (and obvious) ending that is supposed to be a revelatory twist.  But I can only say it once more, without bothering to make the characters real--who cares?    A message can only take you so far.  I'd have rather have watched a relevant speech, because no one here was concerned with drama.  
 The old timers like me back in the inner cities where Smokey and the Miracles orginally put their stake down in Motown and R&B royalty, used to call him Bill Smokey Robinson. Whenever I meet someone who recalls the days back in the early to mid sixties when the black transistor made in Japan radios were blaring down the New York City school hallways playing The Tracks of my Tears, Shop Around, OOO Baby Baby (which brings back memories of my first interacial slow dance in the Junior High School gym) and the Tears of a Clown, all selections being on The Ultimate Collection~Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, I know that my buddy remembers Smokey's spindly aura on the stage and his silky smoooth and relaxed delivery. I apologize to my readers for run on sentences but Smokey requires such detailed explanation as a legendary contributor to soul, R&B and the Motown wall of sound (they had one too) that my effusive and continuing acclamation of this cherished and enormously loved performer is understated. I heard that Smokey recently brought his performance to Flint, Michigan or maybe some other backyard town in auto country. I really wish that I could have been there to see Smokey put out before a hometown crowd. That must have been nothing short of a miracle. I am going to hit the click button now myself, I need to hear again the sounds that captivated all of us when we walked down the hallways in Junior High with the made in Japans, fingerpopping all the way. Please note, I meant to push 5 stars on this CD and cannot figure out how to correct the above. I apoligize for any misunderstanding however everybody who has ever been touched by Smokey's music probably realized this faux pas.  Jay Adler,    Massapequa, New Yor 
 Bought it for school.  Enjoyed the other books I bought, but this one put me to sleep.  Written more for a professional academic or corporate board member (I enjoy much more pragmatic books) 
 Far from containing any ground-breaking revelations, this book is essentially old news. Except for a few details that Block has added, virtually everything in it can be found in Harold Peterson's "The Man Who Invented Baseball," which was published in 1973 
 I want to respond to what a lot of other reviewers have said, here.  I agree, the album is horribly boring.  And it's absolutely fine to be a group that doesn't want to be labeled... genre-benders are the best in art, music, and literature.  The issue I take with the album isn't simply that it's not trip hop, but that it's BAD.  It's just poorly made music.  Saying that "maybe they were purposefully trying to be corny with their lyrics" doesn't make the lyrics any less painful, nor does it save the poorly- and boringly-written tunes themselves.  I'm simply not buying that this was some big experiment in sarcasm or irony.  These are not "feel good" songs, they're "Ouch, are these really the same guys that did Trigger Hippie?" songs 
 I have been a devoted Hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation.  Although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical, the story is just so silly I found it hard to keep my attention focused.  I compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which I do with my children on occasion.  Sorry, I just couldn't finish it 
 I have owned a 4-quart Romertopf for a few years and wanted a cookbook to try things beyond my current self concocted recipes for turkey parts and duck. The title of this book sounded very promising, but if I had looked through this book in a bookstore, I would not have gotten it.   Some of the recipes are nice, but could just as, actually more, easily be made using regular baking dishes than clay pots. I was looking for a cookbook where using a clay pot made a difference in the final product--and this book is not it.   As two examples out of many I could use:   1. Braised Red Cabbage with Cranberries - All the clay pot does is provide a covered dish for the final cooking. Prep cooking is done in a frying pan. One could just as easily make this dish completely in the frying pan, covering it until done, or use any covered container one already has and finish it in the oven.   2. Banana Bread Pudding - Calls for use of a cazuela, a Spanish, clay pot that looks like a high sided pie pan. The cazuela is not necessary for this dish to be made. Any similar shaped, metal or glass, baking dish could be used.  Whether one likes lamb or not, the recipe for Gigot of Lamb with Garlic is one of the few recipes in this little book that is probably much nicer made in a Romertopf (or other covered clay pot) than in a normal covered roasting pan.  The most frequently called for Romertopf size is 3-quart. 
 I was not expecting the book to be so sports oriented.  I guess I need to go back and look at the description.  I have only made if through the first few chapters and it is b-o-r-i-n-g!!!!  It is rare that I don't finish a book I start, but I think I'm done with this one 
 I like stories of friendships esp male bonding like jo beverley's "rogues". They prove that strong men can and do have deep feelings and deep friendships. Because of the relationship of these 3 heroes it made sense to republish as an anthology. The problem is, it is a huge book that take forever to read because it is so wordy. The characters are great and have depth.But where I liked "the devils heiress", I hated the "dragons' bride" and demon's mistress was only so-so. Thus the overall rating for the book is low.Definitely not worth the price.......... 
 I think of Caroline Myss' other two books as adding to my information and spiritual knowledge.  This boook however does not have the same effect.  It's main theme is to 'pay it forward'. 
 "Honor Thy Father" is a highly santized look at the Bonanno crime family, one of the infamous "Five Families" in the New York Mafia.The principal character is the son of the Family Boss. Because the author had the cooperation of the Bonannos in writing "HTF", a reader can scarcely expect any juicy "inside the mafia" expose. And, of course, that is exactly what the reader will NOT get. The story suffers further by its' studied, almost languid pace. Ultimately, "Honor Thy Father" is a tale leading nowhere and signifying nothing. The one and only saving grace is the historical background provided on the OTHER New York area families and the intrigues, betrayals, rubouts, deportations, etc that have provided so much entertainment. I remember the unsuccesful"hit" on Frank Costello and the succesful Park Sheraton Hotel hit on Albert Anastasia (in his barber chair at the Park Sheraton Hotel)because, at different times,I lived near the sites. On my way to school,I daily walked past Frank Costello's apartment building at 115 Central Park West. Other than this New York Mob trivia, "Honor Thy Father" has zero to offer. And nowhere between the pages is a single "honorable" act performed. Readers should look elsewhere for tales of honor or of the Mafia 
 omg... let me say it again,, OMG!!  wuts up with this movies  the first broly movie was freeking sweet but man the creaters must have been bored and said , " hmm i feel like making a brolly movie... yeah i got 10 minutes let me make it real fast"  sersiously this made no sense.,.. i mean first off we all know how strong broly is.... having said that  videl should have been killed off instantly after broly attacked her and the same with kid gotenn and trunks..    the fighting just was so slow and stupid and  brolly mostly jsut hovered and didnt do anything really... bah im getting annoyed just typing this...   for all you DBZ fans  stay far  far faaar away from this one and just stick to either the first broly movie or get like the  lord slug movie  they are both way better!!!! 
 Started out okay with the promise of interesting characters, but just got dull and wordy. Didn't finish it. Maybe more enjoyable for a South-American history buff 
 This wasn't a particularly good overview of the securitization market.  It focusses on cash U.S. mortgage backed securities 
 The faith of George Bush is in what? Money? Oil? His dad?  My Lord said Love thy enemy and do good to those who harm you Not kill a million iraqis for oil fields  My Lord said it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven  Not give all our national treasury and indebtedness to the wealthiest corporations while impoverishing our people and leaving our elderly and infirm to drown in a rainstorm  My Lord said Blessed are the peacemakers not those who keep changing their lies about going to war.  What is his faith again? My Lord said: Not all those who cry Lord, Lor shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  My Lord said it. I believe it. Case closed.  What his faith all about? Material possession does not prove election anymore than faked vote counts   SEll all that you have and give the money to the poor and then come follow me, said the Lord, and you will have riches in heaven.  Blessed are the POOR reads his Sermon on the MOunt in Saint Luke  Anyway what's that cover photo supposed to be? Mr. Jim Beam make him nauseous again? Or does he hang his head in shame for the one million dead for their oil fileds in Iraq? FOr our stolen elections? For the dead of KAtrina? For murdering our US Consitution and Bill of Rights? No, it's gas. Hoping no one notices he cut it. No, looks like he's controlling a leak into his Depends.  
 This book, like most sci/fi trilogies, doesn't need to be stretched over three books. It's clearly padded with words to stretch it out so consumers will have to shell out extra bucks to get to the conclusion. And what it is padded with is a boring-love-that-can-never-be tale. 
 In this book, Gladwell reaches the astounding conclusion that EXPERTS know more than other people. That if you spend YEARS doing something, or researching it, or training, you will be able to spot more details than others. A real eye-opener. 
 This brush was not as firm as expected.  I expected greater quality from the Sephora brand.  However, the price of the brush was rather cheap in comparison to "finer" brushes.  So in actuality you are getting whay you pay for with this item and nothing more 
 This book consists of a lot of name dropping and stories from the world of golfing greats. In the appendix section Dr. Bob Rotella sums up all his golf wisdom in four pages. Reading these pages you get all the information Dr. Bob Rotella has to offer.  For the average bogey golfer "Golf is not a game of perfect" prescribes working on her short game. From my analysis a lot of bogey golfers lack length to be able to shoot greens in regulation. Most of them eliminated double bogeys by working on their short game. For these players this book is no help at all.  I rated this book with one star and not with zero because Dr. Bob Rotella gives one great advice: create and stick to your pre-shot routine 
 Gaines should be put in the same category as Taliban. I grew up in Bergenfield, did lines with the Buress sisters', Olton, and Rizzo at Garvey's house. Yes, alot of children back then did waste time just as I did. But don't think that Gaines few moments in Bergenfield could sum it all up. Gaines knew nothing but to be a glory stealer for a book that was going to happen anyway. How about the other suicides, Like Paul Murphy and Chris Hurt. You should have done your math Gaines. Cooper's Pond had finger digits from snapping turtles that were restless. Gaines had nothing in mind but selfishness intentions. I'd like to meet Gaines and do a reminder. A product of the Teenage Wasteland she has described makes me think..I got a B.S of Science in M.E. a few years ago and I've been serving in the military as well. Ms. Gaines should remember me if we ever cross paths. Bergenfield was a town at that time that was showing the future. Ms. Gaines didn't see that, she just wrote a book....Words, they are so eas 
 I should have known this movie would be terrible because it stars Matthew McConaughey.  McConaughey plays one thing well - the smarmy yuppie.  Having grown up in a working class Manhattan family, I know the type well.  He does an excellent job at this one role for which he is type cast again and again.  This film is no exception.  The worst thing about this movie is that even though I only watched about 2/3, I had to use grease-cutting cleaner to clean my tv screen free of all the slime.  
  Do dogs understand language?  Do they have their own syntax and grammar?  Stanley Coren thinks so.  Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people's interest and sell more copies...  The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant.  Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs.  When the door closes I'll say, "What do we do on an elevator?" and they'll all sit.  This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, "Look!  They understand every word you say!"    Not really.  I trained the dogs to do this by first saying "What do we do on an elevator?-we sit."  Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from "What do we do on an elevator?" to "Sit" quite easily.  In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all.  So it isn't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it's my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.    Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him.  Why?  Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog "understands" his words.  Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language.  But looked at objectively it's far more likely that the dog's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process.   Coren would still disagree.  He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there's a kind of syntax or grammar at work.  I'm sorry, Stan, but real language doesn't operate on such a simplistic level.  And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.    Look, it's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren't (which isn't always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state.  In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can't be.  It's not grammar or syntax, it's emotion, pure and simple.    Even if Coren hadn't thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he'd know that a dog's brain has no Broca's area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible.  But as with other books he's written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn't seem to care much about the truth.    Still, I have to admit that it's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc.  As a result we're almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists.    I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question.  And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, "Do you love me?" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose.  Does he understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him?  Of course not.  But I know he understands the emotion.  It's a shame that Coren doesn't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language.    If I could I'd give this book no stars at all 
 Stopped working after one day! Show scrambled characters on the LCD. This scale was probably made for aliens since its reading is not legible to the human eye. Returned it. 
 Let me begin by saying I love Jillian Hunter's writing. Her trilogy on the Boscastle family is wonderful: Humorous, Passionate, and Fast Paced. If you read my lists, you'll know that I absolutely adore romance novels (especially historical ones). Those focusing on the time period (in Fairy Tale) are among my favorites! However, Fairy Tale fell far beyond the standard set w/ Ms. Hunter's other novels. It's obvious this must have been one of her earlier (if not her first) novels.  Fairy Tale was EXTREMELY slow paced. The heroine was an irritating, ignorant, and crass little pest. I like a hard headed and independent heroine. However, Marsali was simply stupid and not at all likeable. The hero was a bit boring and his back story was extremely predictable and anticlimatic. The supporting characters were just as frustrating as Marsali. I tired of reading an entire novel in which 90% of the characters were working against the hero, Duncan, for the majority of the book. I thought Jillian Hunter did a wonderful job in showing why the characters resented Duncan, but she did a horrible job in showing how the characters evolved to accept him. Throughout 85% of the book, Duncan is resented, feared, and disrespected by his clan, then suddenly they don't hate him anymore. It was ridiculous.   The book is littered with material that does very little to advance the plot or develop the characters. This took attention from the romance between Marsali and Duncan. If you didn't know you were supposed to want them together (by reading the back cover), there was very little in the book that made you actually care for Duncan and Marsali as a couple. They had very little chemistry and their "love" story was completely underdeveloped. In addition, several "suspense" elements were thrown into the book. However, because the characters were so one dimensional (an not at all endearing), I found myself not caring what happened to them.   I think Ms. Hunter does a better job writing Regency romance than she does Highland/Scottish romance. I will continue supporting her. However, if you want a good Scottish romance, read Julie Garwood's Ransom, Saving Grace, The Secret, or The Bride. Fairy Tale is an utterly boring and unsatisfying read 
 I don't mind it when people shatter a facade. Only as long as it's true. This book holds no credibility. When Klein claims he was an acquaintence with Jackie, I think that means he picked up something she dropped once. Another thing that seems suspicious is that Klein keeps writing books about the Kennedys. How many times can you write about the same subject? Get a life, Klein 
 Peter Robinson is one of my favorite mystery writers.  I am now trying to get through the audio cd version of Playing with Fire.  The narrator, as I can picture him, is speaking with the spittle collecting and the corners of his mouth.  His attempt at portraying the characters' voices is pathetic.  He should just read it straight out as his "normal" voice is not bad at all.  The story will be good, I know, but have to suffer through this reading may not be worth it 
 I liked the sound of this novel, but just couldn't get into the character, nor the world.  I was simply lost. Do you have to play a stupid board or video game first? I just wanted, and expected, to have a solid reading experience.  Didn't happen 
 For anyone, who is thinking of buyin this CD, don't! You'll be sorry just like I am.  I went into the CD store today and saw the CD.  I asked the clerk if he heard it and he said it had some tight beats and wall all  around tight. I even was being a little facecious with him and told him I  would bring the CD back if he was lyin. Well he lied.  This is the worst  garbabe I've heard Bleed put out.  He is no longer on No Limit which put  out his first and tight CD My balls and my word.  The two CDs don't even  compare.  I will boycott Bleed forever!   I can't believe he fell off this  bad 
 This is the worst book ever written. im serious. It does not make sense, it is really boring. Nothing happens, there is so much unneccesary writting. The author could have written the same information on just 100 pages. Do not buy this book. you will regret it . I repeat, you will regret it. Do not waste your money this book. Please look at other books instead. The author has written the book in a really stupid way. like right at the beggining, the protagonist recieves a grave letter from johhannesburg. Then his wike asks him what they should do about it. Then the protagonist responds DO ABOUT WHAT? then his wife says the letter of course. When I read this, I thought, Damn this book sucks! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!! 
 I don't expect therapy from a romance novel. These two characters dislike each other - "she's humorless, and  prim", and "he's shallow and aimless." They talk about "having to like yourself" - ARGH. They definitely NEED therapy. She loves him but doesn't think he loves her (yawn), and is generally disapproving of him and only reluctantly admits he is a kind man. (Whoa, hold me back!) Delusional feminist overtones (I am strong, I don't need a man, but my deepest dream is to have a husband and family...),   This is a big disappoitment: dry, no chemistry, the big secret is so anticlamatic...and so much exposition instead of story - just let us live it with the characters instead of telling us everything! Read at your risk 
 I got almost nothing out of this book.  I've been file-sharing for about two months.  The worst is that the book is totally out of date; it has almost nothing about bittorrent which has taken over the file-sharing world.  I would only get this book for someone who is new not just to file-sharing, but to the internet in general.  Even then it is only good as an introduction to general concepts; there is little useful detailed technical information 
 Shawn reveals (indirectly) that he is a disloyal Catholic. Now before you rate this review as unhelpful I'll explain why that is relevant: It shows he is a hypocrite and that his book is therefore hypocritical. Now although a hypocrite can get things right, when it comes to morality they usually get things wrong, which Shawn certainly did do in his teachings in this book. For example:  He promotes (and worships) democracy and "liberty" over God. I'm sure some of you Catholics will be like "what? He advocates the Bible in school and school prayer" but that doesn't mean he is advocating it for the right reasons, just as the Pharisees didn't advocate religion and the Old Testament for, ultimately, the right reasons. Now perhaps some of you will think, "Well who cares as long as he is advocating what is right, who cares about his motives." Well he says what his motives are and they go contrary to the Bible, so in the end he is promoting something which is just as self-defeating as liberalism, etc.. He reveals in his book that his motives are to maintain the (publically known) Republican agenda (plus getting the bible and prayer in public schools, etc.), promoting and upholding democracy throughout the world, and indirectly promotes the whitewashed historical teachings and books in public schools (although I'm sure he wouldn't if he really knew more accurately the history of the U.S.)  So, what's wrong with promoting liberty, democracy, and the white wash in schools? Obviously no one wants white wash and most American's know the usual history text books in school are something the inquisitions might have had success using, so I'll move on to liberty and democracy. Liberty in Shawn's eyes INCLUDES the right to promote Catholocism and not just the  traditional religions. For us who are saved and many atheists know that the Catholic religion is a cult, and promoting it is treason (among other things) in our eyes. Now for democracy. The U.S. has a rigged democracy, and it is really an Aristocratic Democracy, everyone knows that, even Shawn, it just slips his mind because he lets himself get majorly distracted.  As an example of Shawn's ignorance of the more complicated parts of U.S. history, and his gullibility, he says in his book that F.D.R. was a democratic leader. Yet many teens in high school know that isn't true having heard his "New Deal". Even wiki acknowledges that that was communistic. He also perpetuates the myth that Islamic terrorists were responsible for twin tower DEMOLITION. Anyone with the net and who knows to double check facts, and who knows the evil side of America's history knows what I mean by "demolition" in reference to 9/11.  He also perpetuates this illogical goal: unity (under democracy) for the sake of it (like just supporting Bush, Jr. regardless of what he says). He doesn't say it but implies it. Unity for the sake of allowing Bush Jr. and the troops in Iraq to have a nice day is stupidity.  And check out this self-centered attitude: "some sick cell of terrorists just attacked my world." Well what happened to the people they attacked, their world, the one that ended that day?  He also picks on Clinton for reasons you can probably guess, as if he was the ONLY bad president. This book is childish, and I don't mean that in a mean way, I mean it's as if it were written by an angry, poorly educated, arrogant preteen who had a good editor.  One thing he does imply, and rightly so, is that the "Koran" is evil. But, big surprise, didn't come out and say that outright, I WONDER WHY?! So much for courage 
 Tremendous service,,,,,,,,,,excellent!  Thanks.  N. Whit 
 	Stories of a Westerner exploring Middle Eastern Christianity normally leads to such disasters as When Angels Fall, so I came to Dalrymple's book a bit skeptical. As I expected, Dalrymple never escapes his western notions about religion. Some were simply annoying, like constantly calling a censer a thurible. Others, such as praising religious relativism and bashing religious particularism, were distressing. While Dalymple is obviously well read and highly intelligent, I got the feeling throughout the book that he had simply read up on the religious and social histories of the groups he met, and never thought to bother with examining their theological literature. It comes as no surprise then when he writes how aghast he was with the fundamentalism of Mount Athos and Saint Saba, or that he is highly skeptical of relic veneration. What it boils down to, eventually, is that his book is little more than a superficial travelogue, and nothing near the thing he was trying to imitate, The Spiritual Meadow.  	Having been in some of the places and met some of the kinds of people mentioned in the book, Dalrymple has an uncanny way to make the idiosyncrasies of the people and places of the Middle East shine through. Most amusing was his account of the brand-new Syrian church in Turkey, all dressed up in the finest neon and flashing lights. As a fellow westerner of Dalrymple, I sympathize fully with his reaction of horror. His method of dealing with the political climate was also amusing, demonstrating the patience and long-suffering needed to wrangle with Middle Eastern politics.  	Having lived in Jerusalem for some time, I found his experiences in Palestine to be most interesting. Having personally seen the rows of cactus plants surrounding bombed out rubble, deserted on the sides of roads or within mostly useless National Parks, the devastation is staggering. The displaced Maronite village Dalrymple visits is no small secret, my professor told my class their story when we passed their current village in the bus, yet their situation is far from resolved. The overarching sentiment of the Palestinian Christians, that they fail to understand the western "Christian" support for a state which mistreats their Christian brothers and sisters, I also felt acutely. The dichotomy between the local Christians who are trying to scrape together their traditional existence and western Christians who seem to believe that the only real people living in Israel are Jews and the Arabs and their history should cease to exist, is so great that they seem to exist on different planets.   	While the current Israeli government seems to be, as Dalrymple says, trying to co-exist with its Christian population peacefully, not everything is roses. Having met Canon Naim Ateek myself, I hardly consider him to be an accurate source of information, just propaganda. The Israeli army now undergoes sensitivity training to Christianity, though this is done at a pro-Israeli Catholic monastery. The main problem is that western money, whether from Jewish or Evangelical Christian sources, is concerned with preserving "biblical" sites, which fits into the Israeli national history nicely, but leaves Byzantine history out in the cold. My school took field trips to two major monastic centers in the Judean desert which have long been in ruins, including the monastery of St Euthemius. Both are under the National Park Authority, though both were nearly impossible to find and lacked proper facilities. The reason for this was simple, our group was likely the only visitors they got all week, if not all month. Another major Byzantine site which had over five ancient basilica churches was slated to come under the National Park Authority soon, though it was uncertain if this was being done in interest of the site or because the site had a great view of the sunset over the Lake of Galilee. Jewish and western tourists being uninterested in Byzantine things, Byzantine sites lack economic potential. Turning a Maronite village into an ancient Jewish revolutionary camp automatically turns it into a money making place. So the mistreatment of Palestinian Christians, currently, is more of an economic enterprise rather than racial discrimination.   	One of the most striking omissions in Dalrymple's book is his failure to visit the Christian Old Quarter of Cairo. His reliance on the Spiritual Meadow shows its bias very clearly here. Since John Moschos considered it to be a heretical holdout of the uneducated Copts, Dalrymple apparently saw little need to put it on his itinerary, hence he leaves out a great chunk of Coptic history. Furthermore, his references to "screaming Coptic monks" sacking Alexandria and his comments about how Coptic sounds inherently "incantational" may be his personal opinion, but it displays his western bias quite clearly. For Dalrymple, the Copts are among the strangest of the strange, and he clearly has done little to understand them or their religious outlook.  	Dalrymple, it becomes obvious, is most at home among the Maronites. He spends an inordinate amount of time talking about them considering that John Moschos never mentions them. For Dalrymple's point of view, because the Maronites are western he understands them better, therefore he regards them more highly. Maronite practices such as speaking English and French fluently, being educated in the west, and their clergy wearing street clothes, are obviously reassuring to Dalrymple, and so he judges them quite favorably. Byzantines are, to Dalrymple, barely tamed westerners, the Byzantine-like Armenians and Syrians are odd in a cute way, but the Copts are beyond the pale of his cognition. At St. Anthony's he can do little more than speculate for many pages how an artistic motif there also shows up in Scotland, and praise the ancient western-focused Coptic missionaries. Redeemable, by anyone's guess, that they were smart enough to go to Scotland, unlike their modern compatriots who think the desert is the only place to learn anything.   Also, the attitude of Dalrymple towards relics and saints is little more than cynical. He goes to ridiculous lengths trying to explain away a miracle recounted in the Spiritual Meadow, and for no point, expect, perhaps, to appease his offended rational mind. He is overtly suspicious of legends and saints, preferring to question them rather than learn what they have to say about the people who believe in them. This gives the impression that Dalrymple does not want his worldview to be challenged, even if it is to recognize a parallel one. In Dalrymple's worldview the dead do not appear in dreams, people who think they do are deluded. While this is a very common western perception, I would have expected someone as widely traveled and read as Dalrymple to have overcome it enough to not dwell on it in his book. Perhaps he has, but he believes that these things made fascinating reading for westerners, so he puts in these oddities for entertainment purposes. However, in the end it does little but reconfirm the superiority of the western worldview to the readers and make the Middle Eastern Christians worldview look childish and stupid.   Dalrymple's praise of the glory days of Alexandria was interesting, but mostly had very little to do with the Spiritual Meadow or Middle Eastern Christians. Instead, it was a time for Dalrymple to bemoan the loss of a western city to "Arabism". John Moschos really would have cared less if the theatre left Alexandria, he would say good riddance, but for Dalrymple this is blasphemy. Dalrymple incessantly praises the previous multi-culturalism of Alexandria, going to far to suggest that Alexandria is the place where Christian theology came into existence because it was there that Christianity syncretized with the world's religions, only to be strayed by murderous "howling" Coptic monks. Here Dalrymple's lack of understanding about religious history and development becomes more than painfully obvious.  	While Dalrymple has the vague notion that the current situation of Christians in the Middle East is on the brink of disaster, his ideals about these Christians is mostly romantic. Dalrymple exudes the feeling that the Middle Eastern Christians should just be like the Maronites, educated, rational, peaceful and tolerant, and give up their fundamentalist notions, and everything will be better. Dalrymple seems not to realize that with the current anti-western propaganda in Middle Eastern Islam, the further the Christians keep away from the West and Israel, the better it is for them. This is not to say that the current Western practice of ignoring Middle Eastern Christians should continue, simply that the current Maronite practice of adopting everything Western does little than confirm in Islamic minds that Christianity is a western plot.   	Overall, Dalrymple is a very good writer in that he does a wonderful job painting the landscape and feeling of a place and culture. However, his cultural and religious bias gets in the way of him actually understanding what is going on. I came away from the book with the feeling of sadness, both for what Christians in the Middle East are presently going through and for insurmountable gap that exists between the worldview of western Christians and that of their religious birthplace. 
 This book seems be based on research done by other doctors who do not own a supplement company.  I bought this book because I could not get good advice on supplements from my doctor.  The advice is very good, although copied, but the supplement advice points the reader toward the Whitaker Institute, which seem to do more research on how to sell vitamins for more moeny than research on curing heart disease The supplements sold by Dr. Whitaker's company are much higher priced than the exact same supplements sold by other reputable supplement comapanies like Puritan's Pride, The vitamin Shoppe, Swansons vitamins etc.  I prefer other books on this subject sold by amazon, particulary one written by Dr. Houston, who runs a hospital research institute and does not own a supplement company.  I find it hard to believe the advice on supplements from a man who is charging triple prices for the supplements that he reccomends in his book.  Elwin Bagley  
  Very disappointed by Canon on the fit of this adapter.  Adapater and shade attachments block camer lens view and create flash shadows  
 I was hoping for a synthesis of findings, rather than a rambling, never-ending series of anecdotes.  Further, the latest evidence on criminal profiling is at best mixed - indicating little scientific credibility or practical usefulness 
 2 months after ordering, i have year to get my first issue.  i'm sure i'll like it...if i ever get it 
 On the surface, John Waters has it all -- a loving wife, a beautiful child, a successful business -- but appearances are deceiving. His marriage is in trouble, his business is under investigation by a federal agency, and his business partner has made questionable financial decisions which jeopardize everyone's future. Into this mix wanders Eve Sumner, a stunningly attractive woman who makes it abundantly obvious she's chosen Waters as her next conquest. However, appearances are again deceiving, because Eve Sumner claims she is actually Mallory Chandler, Waters' first great love.  Funny thing, though: Mallory Chandler died ten years previously.  So who is this woman? And how does she know things only Mallory should know?  In an effort to discover the truth, Waters finds himself involved in an affair that quickly turns dangerous, as Eve/Mallory displays the same obsessive behavior that destroyed Waters' love for Mallory twenty years before.  This novel requires a major suspension of disbelief for its critical plot device: transmigration of a soul. Once the reader accepts that, however, the story moves along quickly and works well within its preposterous premise. Waters flails and fumbles and does his best to fix the mess he's made by getting involved with Eve/Mallory, even as she seems to be setting him up for a murder charge. His desperation and fear are palpable, and certainly mitigate his at times wrong-headed choices. I truly enjoyed this story, that is, until I read the final pages.  The final plot twist, which I won't reveal here, is so farfetched, even within the confines of a plot that stretches suspension of disbelief to its outermost limit, as to spoil all the good trashiness that preceded it. I read the last few pages and threw the book across the room. I felt cheated. I think Mr. Iles wrote himself into a corner and couldn't think of any other way to give the reader a happy ending. Gah.  Never have I been so disappointed with a novel's resolution.  Oh, and the frequent references to a novel written by a character within this novel which happens to have the same title as a novel written by Iles bugged me too.  Gah.  Oh. Go ahead and read the story. Just rewrite the ending in your own head. I did 
 Captain Alatriste is the first in a series and, like a lot of series, you're really rooting for it to be a barnburner so you can go right out and buy the next one and then wait breathlessly for the one after that.  Unfortunately, this is not the case with Captain Alatriste.  The problem is that there isn't enough of Captain Alatriste in Captain Alatriste.  It's told through his own Sancho Panza, Inigo, his steady sidekick, who has stories of his own to tell.  But those stories only distract from the main story, which is paper thin to begin with.  Throw in a lot of songs and poems and you've got a sleepy reader 
 Maybe this book would have been better if the illustrations were better & the colors weren't so off.  Our toddler was not interested in this book at all & I could see why.  This was not one of Wood's best books- try The Big Hungry Bear or King Bidgood's in the Bathtub.  But if you're interested in a book similar to Quick as a Cricket and one SO much better, get A Dragon in a Wagon, by Lynley Dodd 
 This may be one of the most offensive pieces of anti-semtic trash I have ever read.  This book teaches Jewish children that they should be ashamed of and hide their heritage, through the tale of a grandmother who denies her Judaism until her horrified grandson uncovers too much evidence to continue.  I find it unlikely that the woman who wrote this book is really a rabbi, but if she is, she must have been ordained by an extremely reform, lax sect of judaism, or perhaps not Judaism at all.  Keep your children away from this hateful offensive book 
 The sub-title 'How Nature Designed Our Universal Sense of Right and Wrong' has an implied assumption in it, i.e., that Nature has indeed designed a universal sense of right and wrong. It may be possible, likely, or may be plausible, it is definitely NOT a fact. It is not even demonstrated or shown that there is anything like a 'universal' moral sense. Chomsky is working with a given, language is universal and we know what people  talking sounds like, even when we do not understand what they are talking about. We even know that animals communicate via audible channels. We know nothing like this about 'the moral sense'. We know even less about animals and their 'moral sense'. Do lions and tigers and bears have something in common that we don't know about ? So, as far as arguing in the sense that Chomsky does, starting from an observable, this book's attempt to do so is wholly pretentious. It pretends to have an observable, it does not. It claims that this observable is in some sense, universal. It presents no example of a universal moral act. It gives as example, the recent Iraqi fiasco, known as Abu-Ghraib as an example of a monsterously evil immoral act. This last gives the impression that there is a political statement being made here. Would the Holocaust or the on-going, as of January 2007, genocide in Darfur, not been more reasonable  examples. By the way, where is the world-wide recognition of this un-speakable horror in Darfur 'moral sense' ? It is a strong point of this book to separate morals from religion. Does the author present a 'moral' that exists in a community without a religion ? It may have been in the small print. My eyesight is not what it used to be. Could he have given us a few words on 'thou shalt not steal' ? Or any of the moral strictures that Western civilization advocates ? I sat and read a very large portion of this book over a three day period at Barnes and Nobles. It is my habit, that when I find something really worth having, I will frequently then check out the reviews and prices at Amazon. I hope this is not im-moral. This book is a stinker folks. I don't know any part of it to be trust-worthy. I don't know that if I were Chomsky, I would be pleased to see someone claiming to shadow his techniques in such a slip-shod and sloppy fashion. 
   Does anyone actually listen to this before they make it into CD's?  This is the poorest quality band music I've ever heard!  The EQ is moronic.  The high end needs to be cut by at least 12 db's.  The fidelity is lousy.  Sounds like it was recorded with one microphone, and there is definately some clipping going on.  How could Altissimo do this to this great music?? 
 Put simply, it's an odd mixture of current fashion, fiance drama, and - get this one - god 
 This book is really long winded and boring. It rambles a lot and is quite incoherent, though I would give it some credit for trying to sound personable. The chapter on inferential statistics, especially isn't very clear which makes it even more frustrating because stats is already quite a dry topic 
 A reader writes: "However, Mr. Sulloway's book is tightly reasoned and supported by a great deal of research."  You might want to look at the discussion of Sulloway's work in Judith Harris' recent _No Two Alike_, pp 92-112. According to that account, Sulloway's work was never published in a peer reviewed journal, the book in which it was published failed to provide the sort of information needed for other people to check the truth of his results, and Sulloway repeatedly refused requests for such data--for instance, the names of the Protestant and Catholic martyrs whose birth order rankings he offers as evidence, or cites to the studies whose results he claims to summarize.   When someone wrote a critical article pointing out evidence that his factual assertions about the data were false, he delayed the publication for several years by the threat of lawsuits.  Judging by her previous book, Harris is a careful writer, so absent some evidence to the contrary my current conclusion is that Sulloway is a fraud 
 I took the Ethics DSST using this study guide, as well as others. Once I got into the the exam, I was SOOOOO glad that I did NOT just rely on this "official" study guide. It was in NO way all inclusive. In fact, it seemed to abruptly END shortly after an intense overview of the Greek philosophers. The actual exam went far beyond that. I recommend also reading "Being Good" by Blackburn & mixing that with another general "Intro to Ethics" type text.   This particular guide is called the "official guide" to the DSST, but if it is indeed the "definitive" source, Lord help us! 
 A well-crafted but ultimately thin period piece taking place in late '40s-early '50s Southern California, MULHOLLAND FALLS is visually engaging entertainment that yet leaves you unsatisfied as the credits roll.   A powerful cast (Nick Nolte, Jennifer Connelly, Melanie Griffith, John Malkovich, Michael Madsen, Chazz Palmintieri and Chris Penn, et. al.) doesn't lend depth to this two-and-a-half-star effort, though it does distract you from its shortcomings. Director Lee Tamahori, no stranger to the dark side, makes much less than what he might of this potentially impressive tale of unfaithfulness, betrayal, murder and death.  Nolte (Hoover) is the leader of L.A.'s infamous "Hat Squad" a special organized crime task force that busts heads and breaks bones to keep the peace. When Alison Pond (the oh-so-Forties Era Connelly) turns up dead, all the signs of murder point back to her lover, who happens to be head of the Atomic Energy Commission (John Malkovich). Nolte too, it turns out, has had a dalliance with the peripathetic, kinky and very voluptuous Miss Pond. The expectable cover-up destroys Nolte's marriage and career as it evolves.  Although MULHOLLAND FALLS samples many other period films, Tamahori's noir is never quite noir enough. The intrinsic moral dilemma the characters face, of indulging in the hidden side of human nature, never expands past straightforward beating and cheating. Without more, MULHOLLAND FALLS disappointingly ends its run as a fairly mundane morality play about fidelity. 
 The author spends half of the book telling you about the "business" of auto body repair, then glosses over the actual "how-to".  I bought the book to learn how to fix simple dents on my vintage car.  Looks like I'll have to buy another book to find out how to do that 
 I am brand new to freezer cooking.(Cooking at all, in fact) I bought two books at the same time. "Frozen Assets" and "30-Day Gourmet".  "Frozen Assets" tells you what to eat for 30 days and gives you the recipes. Another chapter tells you what to eat for 10 days and gives you the recipes, Unfortunately it repeats the same meals from the other chapter. If I was going to try to freeze for only ten days I could have chosen my own ten.  But the same recipe can be repeated 3-4 times in the book. I looked at the recipes and only found 1-2 that looked appealing to me. I was really disappointed. I wish I hadn't bought it.  I love "30 day gourmet". It taught me how to adjust my recipes and had 100's of others to choose from. 
 I would like to see those negative reviews if they were posted.  Why did they get removed.  It is clear that not everyone agrees with the reviews presented here. I did not find the book as informative as the others here. I found it leaves out a lot of other high-quality and very creative artists.  Please return the negative reviews a mentioned in the one review so we can make our own decisions 
 I am usually enthralled by Maire Brennan's vocals. This time, I just can't get through the album without losing interest. She has several interesting, very beautiful solo albums.  "Perfect time" comes to mind as an example.  Get that one instead 
 I honestly can't review the whole CD because I have only heard Step Up.  It was on the The Late Show with Jay Leno.... I whole song was terrible.  The dancing was awful.  I am not a pop fan by anymeans but this was a joke.  In fact I thought this was a joke - a play off of The Pussy Cat Dolls - until I realized that this is a "real legitement" band....  This does nothing but deteriorate the music scene as a whole.  It floods the market with crap.  yuck - no thank you, even the teenie boppers could find something better to listen to 
 What a disaster!  This movie is a complete waste of time from start to finish.  The animation is ugly, horrible, and unrealistic and the three stories are bland and boring.  What was Disney thinking?  Oh, I know!  "Let's see if we can eek a little more cash out of Cinderella.  Who cares if we destroy a beloved classic?"  Several main characters are completely different from the original movie and it makes no sense.  In the first story, the King has turned from a happy-go-lucky doting grandpa-wannabe into a stuffy, sour old curmudgeon.  Suddenly there's a rule about no commoners in the palace?  Uh...isn't there a line in the original about "every eligible maiden in the kingdom?"  The palace was FULL of commoners that night.  The story picks up as the Prince and Cinderella return from their honeymoon, so in the space of a few weeks, the King has completely changed.  I guess they weren't creative enough to come up with anything that would stay true to the characters.  The other two stories are equally nauseating and are not worth my time to review or your time to read.  Avoid this mess of a movie.  The really sad thing is that "ugly, horrible, unrealistic animation and bland and boring stories" pretty much describes any Disney sequel or direct-to-video slop on the market 
 Mixed low review-  The single biggest negative is the contrast/brightness level of the screen, which makes it near impossible to see except at certain angles and light conditions.  Unfortunately, that is a huge Achilles heal.  Otherwise, great electronics, features, and stylus operation.  I would try to demo this before buying since the screen issue could be a deal breaker (unless there is something wrong with mine, which I doubt, I would not buy this again 
 It's always hard to judge product quality from anecdotal evidence, but I purchased one of these in mid 2006.  On using it, my camera crashed pretty often, eventually being unable to finish booting at all with the card installed -- a problem it had never exhibited with other CF cards.  Eventually I fed it to a PC and ran a badblocks scan on the thing, which turned up several dozen bad blocks, some of them in the regions generally used for metadata on the FAT filesystem most cameras use.  That's potentially a serious issue, because while all modern filesystems can be given lists of bad blocks to avoid, rendering partially faulty media usable, digital cameras and other embedded devices often use partial implementations of filesystem standards and may not honor bad block lists 
 I wish some other reviewer or the synopsis had warned me of the narrow and excluding point of view of most of this book. It is no excuse saying the reader is supposed to assume this point of view since this is a book of apologetics, I happen to enjoy C.S.Lewis very much without having to agree with every word of the Bible or all the tenets of a specific branch of a Christian church.  In my opinion this book teaches christians to look down on all other faiths in spite of professing to respect them. 
 The Hoover Floormate was great the first two times we used it.  Along with the Old English it did a great job cleaning and picking up the solution.  After using it twice, it had difficulty dispensing solution from the Reservoir.  This was remedied by having to apply downward pressure constantly.  It still got the job done.  Not too long after that it wouldn't vacuum the solution back into the unit.  I got a great clean for the price divided by four uses.  You do the math.  I'll stick to the "cheap" clorox thing we pulled out of the closet after I put the Floor ex-Mate into the trash.  Very disappointe 
 I thought Weston's book was a little too short when I first picked it up. Turns out I should have relied on my instincts.  While I believe Weston does a fair job introducing readers to the concept of arguing, he fails terribly overall. Basically, any student that took Math in high school that involved "proofs" would know Weston's entire book.   The only thing I really enjoyed was the index on "cheating."  Don't get this book if you have ever taken anything involving mathematical proofs or philosophy. Otherwise, knock yourself out 
 I have read the previous 11 reviews on this book and they all have one thing in common; NOT ONE of them says that they have ACTUALLY repaired  or even taken a watch apart by using this book.   The first 20 pages are easy to understand, but after that too many special tools are required and I can't follow it. After reading the parts of this book that I do understand, I don't see how just ANYBODY could repair a watch by using this book. It seems to me that this book was written with the intention for it to be used as a TEXTBOOK for a watch repair tech school or for watch repairmen to refer to in their trade.    If you're looking for a book that EXPLAINS how a watch works and what makes it tick but not intended to be a repair book, well, you won't find it in this book. For half the price of this one, try 'Instant Expert: Collecting Watches'. 
 Although the designs are full page illustrations, the areas to be colored are incredibly small.  They would be challenging for an adult.  Don't even consider using them with children 
 I am shocked to read the reviews on this cookbook.  It's terrible. The pictures are beautiful, and the food looks wonderful, but the cookbook doesn't hold up.  The recipes will call for ingredients that are not in the ingredient lists, and you have to know how to cook to use it...for instance, it will tell you to use 3 slices of ginger, but won't tell you to peel the ginger first.  Elsewhere, it says to "bring to a simmer and simmer" when it means bring to a boil and simmer.  We tried 3 recipes, all of which bombed--2 of them were too spicy to eat, and I love spicy food.  This is a horrible cookbook.  I can't figure out why Donna Hay is such a popular cookbook author.  The only cookbook I ever threw away was her Fast Food cookbook for similar reasons, and this one is just as bad, although I did hear the Sticky Chicken and Parmesan Chicken recipes were good.  Try them first 
 Or I should say was, Both badly drawn, written, and performed by terrible voice actors.  The DVD package and the disks are also badly made.  Still using below average AOL software for the transfer to disk, aren't you Warners, You Geeks 
 I found this book to only be okay and boring it needs zaz not blaa..That is what it is blaa. I would pass it on or give it to a in-law then to keep it.It has good reciepes but no more then the other ones and it is a basic book. I think ,if this is to have a bang it needs more then what it has. 
 So sad to see that this was "Manufactured in China," otherwise I would have given this heart-tugging nostalgia-waxing book 5 stars. Sigh, is nothing sacred anymore? Apparently not 
 Gardner's book is full of banal and often incorrect observations. It's hard to believe he has received over 20 honorary degrees from universities around the world if his ideas are this unoriginal. He chooses the staggeringly bad examples of Margaret Thatcher, George Bush and BP CEO John Browne as people who have successfully changed minds. He doesn't mention that Thatcher and Bush antagonized large sections of their countries' populations, completely failing to change their minds, in fact hardening their positions of opposition; in large part due to these leaders' own refusal to ever change their minds or consider alternative policies. Gardner lavishes praise on Bush for switching from isolationism to an interventionist foreign policy after 9/11, without any mention of the PNAC team that had already planned to invade Iraq even before 9/11.   As for John Browne, his claim to have repositioned BP as an environmentally and socially concerned company has been discredited in the past year with the explosion at a Texas refinery and the oil spill on the North Slope that led to the admission that BP hadn't done any of the anti-corrosion work it was supposed to do on its pipelines.   Another poor example is Lawrence Summers of Harvard. For some reason Gardner doesn't mention the biggest controversy Summers was involved with, when he said that women could never be as good at science as men. Gardner's use of case studies from academia is another bad choice because most readers won't have heard of these professors and won't care much about their internal disputes. It's a shame Gardner didn't tackle any real-life problems, such as how to change the minds of Creationists.   Gardner insists on using "she" and "her" instead of "he" and "his" as the neutral pronoun for political correctness, and another irritating habit he has is to invent jargon that will obviously never catch on, such as "wetware" and "dryware" for the internal workings of the brain and "GoodWork" for being ethical at work, yet another painfully banal concept.   In one section Gardner describes how a psychologist uses a patient's dream to understand how the patient sees himself (or should I say herself even if he was male?) in relation to others, which sounds to me like total cod psychology, but that's just my own reaction to dream interpretations.   Regarding computers, Gardner believes that people are starting to prefer interaction with computers over interaction with other people. This again is utterly mistaken and it's clear that Gardner has next to no experience with the internet. Thanks to the internet there has been an explosion in human interaction and far more people talk with other people than with computers. Gardner says people can get emotional solace from interaction with computers that are programmed to communicate and cites a book written in 1995, but gives no further justification of this claim.   Anyone writing about changing minds ought to have a full understanding of how people use the internet and communicate on all kinds of levels that weren't possible before this technology existed, for example role-playing or participating in a political discussion forum, as well as absorbing surreptitious marketing on the internet.   Gardner's specific advice on how to change minds consists of using a variety of words that all begin with "re" for convenience, eg resonance and resistance. I had hoped to learn how to communicate my ideas better from this book, but all I learnt was that it was a bad book. 
 This could have been a good movie. The premise was ripe for exploitation and nobody exploits the stupidity of people in general and young people in particular better than National Lampoon. They are the acknowleged masters of the exploitation genere: movies with absolutely no redeeming social value that still leave you laghing. In this case, however, they exploited only their reputation.  The premise is of a couple of young idiots looking for an easy life without work. Hey...it's worked for years. They fail at just about everything including purse snatching and armed robbery. Finally they hit upon a scheme to marry a couple of rich spinsters and wait to collect the inheritance. There is a problem, though, in that the spinsters are hard up for cash as well and conceive of a plot to marry the dumb kids who tried to mug them, insure them heavily and then kill them for the payout. It had so much potential for comedy and it falls flat.  There are a few moments of brief humor but they are far too few and far between. Most of my time was spent agonizing "surely, it will get better". It didn't.  I almost gave this one a single star. What kept me from doing so is that there are a few movies out there that are even worse. Unfortunately, I have seen some of them.  Buy this one if you MUST complete your National Lampoon Collection or if you want something to distract you from the pain of a root canal. Otherwise, don't bother. Even renting is a stretch 
 The reason I can never fully like this album is because of what it created in it's wake, the "float on" kids. I've been listening to modest mouse since when they began and I am disappointed going to a show and having a thousand kids scream at the top of their lungs for that song. If you listen to any of their other stuff, you will realize that it sounds nothing like original modest and they have made their first "mass produced" superhit. The album has it's moments with "blame it on the tetons" and "the world at large" but "dance hall" and "satin in a coffin" bring it down. If you enjoyed listening to modest mouse before this cd came out, don't buy it. You will be disappointed 
 I'm sorry to say it but I dont think this is a very good Bill Frisell album. It sounds a bit over-pretentious to make covers of orchestral music and it doesnt come out very well in my opinion. Besides anything that contains a song by Madonna, by definition cannot be good, right? These songs are all cover stuff that might be "interesting", if you like these songs in their original format, but for jazz-people: obviously there was a reason why we chose to listen to jazz and NOT to pop. Instead I would highly recommend listening to Ghost Town, Good Dog Happy Man, Nashville or Sound of Summer Running to get some real fresh genuine samples of Bill's harmonic world and abilities as a composer 
 Nine is a beautiful show... one of the most amazing shows I've ever had the pleasure of seeing. I did not see the revival, and this recording does not in anyway make me wish I had. Antonio's performance is extremely flat. It all seems so calculated and rehearsed, which is not at all Guido's character. Guido Contini is charming, smooth, and a con-artist in many ways. Antonio missed that completely. I saw his performance on the Tony Awards show, and it made me want to cry. There was none of the character I loved so much there.  The other performances were, for the most part, ok to good. None surpassingly great, except Chita Rivera, who, sadly, does not have enough to do to save the show.  Get the original 
 I did not find this book helpful for someone who has been medically diagnosed as having true thyroid disease. It is old news.  Perhaps can be helpful to someone who suspects they my have a thyroid condition who is just beginning the journey into thyroid disease 
 I bought this book after reading several positive reviews on it. However, I was very disappointed with it. The author attempted to make the book culturally diverse and inclusively based, but I did not find her method effective. I did not like the premise of the book that in order to be acceptable to others, there have to be commonalities. Differences as well as similarities should be embraced to better understand the individual. Stereotypes and finding similarities are not necessary in describing or understanding individuals 
 This book does have some good basic information, but it is full of fluff, poorly designed, and overpriced. Most of the images are in black and white (there are some color plates in the center of the book and color images on the Web site, which are small and difficult to find), and there are not nearly enough examples. About 75 pages are devoted to realtors, insurance adjustors, etc. For 24.99, the book would have been better with a couple hundred fewer pages and color pictures.  If you want a book to cover the basics, try Derrick Story's "Digital Photography Pocket Guide," or for a much more comprehensive view of digital photography, check out "Real World Digital Photography. 
 I hate this book.  The author coins a catch phrase "ambitchious" and uses it CONSTANTLY throughout the book.  It sounds like a "call to battle" for all women.  I loathe the attitude that this book takes that it's us against them.  Why can't we realize that we all need each other in the business world.  I believe that many women need empowerment (I am one of them) but I think this book sets the wrong tone.  I am re-selling my book ASAP.  
 It was difficult to stay "tuned-in" to this book.  A few good ideas, but nothing new or different.  It is not a book that I would recommend, however, I might try to listen again -- just to see if I missed the point.  I certainly would NOT give this book as a gift 
 This book was full of great ideas for people 12 and under. if you're looking for good ideas for fun things to do on a date I would advise you to look elsewhere 
 If you have no idea what Internet is and have never seen ebay web site then you might learn something from this book. But for an average Internet-savvy person it offers little to nothing. There is a lengthy description of well-know information (like terms of sale of ebay) and constant selling of ebay business model: nothing you can't read elsewhere 
 This movie turned out to be laughable, annoying garbage. Horrible film 
 i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
 Chapter 2. Apparently I'm a member of "the Petrified Forest," a.k.a. those of us who have chosen not to have children. Now, despite Mr. Bronson's claim that "parenthood is on trial," in the world where I live as a married woman with no kids, parenthood is largely believed to be the default position everyone is expected to take, unless they are unmarried or medically infertile. Because that's the case, I'm aware that the decision not to have children is considered strange to some people, and would probably normally have passed this by. However, Bronson's raison d'etre here is the telling of people's life stories in order to "answer life's biggest questions." It strikes me as rather telling, then, that in the course of this he is willing to dismiss and stereotype an entire group of people, all of them individuals with their own reasons and their own stories, with a page of mockery and a glib label. If he's so casual and quick to judge on this issue, I can't really take the rest of his insights too seriously. 
 I just finished watching Das Boot.  To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous.  Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.  If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.  If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot 
 I am 15 years old and was required to read this book as summer reading for my school. Let me just say that this is the most punishingly boring book I have ever opened. I say opened because I just could not finish it. I was doing fine until I reached his section about the future of computers. I had to skip the entire section...about 50 pages or so. It, along with almost every other section of the book is impossible to understand, at least for a 15 year old. After that, the book just kept going downhill, and I gave up. This book is not interesting in the least. Avoid at all costs 
 Most people seem to like the soundtrack from"Glory",but this fact does not necessarily make"Glory"a great,or even good soundtrack...Most people also like the food served atMacdonald's,but no intelligent person would argue in favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbers...It is something to put in one's mouth whenever nothing better is available and one is hungry...The same might be said regarding"Glory"...If one's tastes run to choir music,almost any gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid choir music to be found here...As for the themes,they are commonplace variations,often bootlegged from other scores by the same composer,or new work that the composer later bootlegged into other scores,so,all in all,the effort plays rather like a buffet offering at a cheap,"homestyle"diner...The film,on the other hand,was well done,and,apparently,from reading many of the other reviews here,the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction with the film itself,rather than very much stand-alone praise for the score.Horner has written a lot of really,really beautiful and original scores,but perhaps because most of his best efforts have been for small or little-noticed movies these have not been recognised for thier greatness...So,in sum,we are left with a very popular film,provided with a very mundane score by an award winning composer 
 Miseducated lunacy in print. The author needs a good English teacher and a shrink before she publishes another book. To see how well she managed her own personal life, read her previous semi-fictional autobiography. Another unemployed degree-holder looking for attention and profits 
 Like most indie gay themed movies, "Trick" had quite a bit of buzz around it. A terrific movie with Tori Spelling! How could I not love it?  I loved "Die Mommy, Die!", "Girls Will Be Girls", and "Jeffrey". So I gotta love this too, right? Right??  I found it cloyingly sweet and completely out of touch with reality. A hot go-go boy wants to hook up with a nerdy dweeb?    Uh... why??  So they spend the whole evening looking for a place to get busy.  And then it's one contrived situation after another getting in the way of their plans.  As much as I can't stand Tori Spelling's "acting", she's the only performer not phoning it in. (Maybe she had an extra espresso before the shoots?)  What little life there is in this movie, it owes it to her.  The problem is that both male leads are incredibly dull and not that good looking.  The "sizzling" dancer looked like bored monkey. And the soft, sensitive Gabriel has no personality. Why these two people continue to want to have sex with each other after six hours of roadblocks is a complete mystery.  I guess if go-go boy dropped the zero and found another guy (which wouldn't be too much of an effort for him), there wouldn't be much of a movie.  A cameo by Miss Coco Peru is a nice treat.  But she's lit so unflatteringly and gives a monologue so ghoulish, you'd think she was in a different movie.  High expectations, very low gratification. Honestly, skip it 
 It was all I could do to finish this book. The subject matter interested me because I knew someone who committed suicide, so I was curious as to how a humorous spin could be put on such a dismal subject matter. There was some funny dialog, but I was disappointed in this book overall. The characters were unlikeable: an abnoxious teenager, a wimpy middle-aged woman, etc. Not only were the characters totally annoying, they didn't like each other - yet they kept hanging out together. Yeah, I get the whole idea that they were depressed and had no one else to hang out with or anything else to do, but the author didn't convince me of why they would want to keep meeting up, going on vacation together, etc. There were also some rediculous threads in there, like lying about the angel on top of the building. That was when the book started to lose me.   I made it through to the end, but it was a great effort and I just skimmed the last 75 pages or so 
 This movie was nowhere near the original, so should you wish to watch it, don't expect to be in stitches the whole time.  I honestly like it less and less each time I watch it, which to me is a mark of a bad movie.  It does have it's moments, hence the 2 stars (it is after all Bill and Ted, it HAS to have moments!).  My suggestion is rent/borrow it before purchasing it.  If you love it--buy it.  If not--don't.  
 Unless you're into spamming folks, who filter out junk mail anyway, you won't find much value in this book. Each chapter has some hypster claiming wild successes from their email (spam) campaign in order to get recognition (and thus advertise to the reader). 
 This was one of the worst books I have ever read.  The language and content was awful!  If you are planning on buying it,please, don't.  I usually try to stay open-minded about books I read, but this was awful 
 This book is too big an attempt by the famed Harvard biology professor to try to cover "everything". If we compare Mr. Wilson's "total map" with Mr. Ken Wilber's attempt on the same kind of synthesis. It will become obvious that Mr. Wilson fell short because he puts an "Environmental Policy" category where a "Spirits/Psychology" one is more appropriate. How can any integration attempt misses such important inner subjects?! I guess Mr. Wilson decided that he will stick to his iconoclastic scientism view rather than being open-minded. We, as readers, should be aware of his bias. There was a Newsweek bookreview article titled: "Why Wilson is Wrong" published in 1999.  
 While this was nowhere near as bad as IMPOSSIBLE, this was just boring and very repetitive.  And the end - the storm - wasn't that in Bittersweet?  A storm on a yacht and the hero comes to claim the heroine??  I have read Danielle Steel for half my life now.....named my daughter after her....but I long for the day when I can say "She's BACK! 
 Though this is a nice little book with good photo illustrations of the postures/exercises and a nice introduction to chakras, these exercises are very difficult for a beginning student. I will try them further down the fitness road, much further 
 To see my point read Edgar C. Whisenant's "Why The Rapture will be in 1988"  HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!     Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises.  This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old "The sky is falling", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times.  For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in "the last times." He "knows" this because he sees so many antichrists around.  1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the "last times. 1 Peter 4:7 "The end of all things is at hand." James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon.     Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called "End Time Signs" did NOT apply?  The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough?  One of the signs of the "mark of the beast" started in 1948.  The Doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the Social Security Number system.  Recently, someone "set a bad precedent" by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip (In the wayward animal of course)     It seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the Chicken Littles has been making excuses ever since it all began.    2 Peter 3:4 "Where is the promise of his coming?" The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years."  Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.  Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, "Behold, I come quickly.  Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!      
 what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke.  I hated it 
 Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks.... 
 I'm going to be short & sweet.  This is very well-written & scary -- targeted directly at your religious prejudices and superstitions.  But it's so effectively written that it's clear someone was bucking for a movie or TV-series deal here.  It's a bit too neat, folks.  The incidents described are just too well-structured, dramatically speaking.  The pandering to the Catholic church and it's perspective is undoubtedly an attempt to gain their backing & blessing, too.  But now, is this all for real?  Da ya think its true?  Well, if you do then please let me try to sell you that parcel of land I own on the Big Island right below that active volacno.  While I do believe in spirits and evil entities, I am also a writer myself -- and in the incidents described here, one can easily see that "structured fiction" is branded all through it 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 I am a very happy wife and mother, with fairly conservative views.  As someone who's career is in research, I am disgusted with what others are considering "well researched".  The author has taken facts and twisted to her own advantage, and to the disservice of women.  The "supporting facts" in the book are as comical as the cover.  This author attempts to make a few good points, but then ruins her concepts with overwhelming bias 
 This is NOT what I expected.  I thought this was going to be a "documentary".  I thought this was going to show the kids being booked, wearing the prison uniforms, eating with the inmates, going to the yard, and then being locked in their cells.  None of that happened. Instead, this entire film was shot in one room, with the kids in a big circle, and the inmates or (lifers), lecturing and yelling in their faces, about getting raped, shanked, and beaten to death in prison. This is a good educational film to show at special schools for troubled youth.  Or the Y.M.C.A.. This is not a movie to watch for fun or entertainment 
 I really thought the author had a terrific idea in writing a send up of our modern world plotted around a sensational killing. All the elements were there, the media, hollywood, gays, etc. However, he missed the opportunity to paint the characters and the plot in broad satirical brush strokes. Often you could almost take these characters seriously. The dialogue, which is probably typical for Dunne, is too clever by half. This book certainly did not make me want to read any more of his writings 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 I was livid when I saw this movie after reading the book. It is barely on course with the book. They could have done a much better job with that story. What a waste of good actors like Denzel and Salli Richardson. 
 I realize that this is an Amazon Editors pick for 2003, but I'm not sure exactly what they saw in this novel.  I found it to be tedious, dry and uninspiring.  The author's writing style is confusing and overtly manipulative, so I couldn't buy into the story that she was trying to sell me. By the end I was feeling completely cold toward all of the characters and didn't care whether they lived or died - I just wanted to the book to end.  I kept reading though, fully expecting an amazing ending that would warrant the Editors Pick, but I was sadly mistaken.  I could not believe how terrible the ending was.  Turner Hospital tries to throw a surprise into her conclusion, but it falls completely flat (probably because I didn't give two shakes about the characters in the first place.)  Anyways, don't buy this book.  It's bad.  Really, really bad 
 I bought this based on the enthusiasm of the reviews.  I can only surmise that the reviewers are either friends and family of this group, or that Incognito has compromising pictures of the reviewers.  If you're into wedding bands, then this is for you.  If you're looking for an original sound with a real groove, look elseswhere.  
 I have a 2 gb player, which I like. I wanted a player with more capacity, so I ordered the 8 GB model. I tried charging the device but it never seemed to take a full charge. When I attached the device to my computer, I got a message about invalid drivers for the device. I looked at their online support and tried their suggestions, but it didn't help. I talked to Creative Zen phone support many times, they seemed to be more interested in getting rid of me rather than helping me. They would send me emails suggesting solutions and hang up as quickly as they could. I updated Windows, motherboard drivers, changed registry settings, cleaned the drive and reset the device, all to no avail. I returned one device and got another, just to see if the first device was defective. It didn't help. I tried the phone support again, and they sent me the same emails I got before. I finally gave up and am now looking at other higher capacity devices.    
 I have been a huge fan of L. M. Montgomery's work since I was an eleven-year old girl living in the Caribbean.  I've read and re-read, and re-read her stories again and again, and can't seem to get enough.  The first two film installments in the Anne of Green Gables story are warm, beautiful, funny, inspiring and moving pieces of work, that are more or less faithful to Montgomery's original novels.  The third installment is a travesty.  Anachronism, bad dialogue, bad plot and plain old bad acting plague this "sequel".  I say "sequel" in quotes, because the thing I dislike the most about the movie is the fact that the storyline is a complete departure from what Montgomery had envisioned for Anne so long ago.  What a way to end it.  That said, I've decided to purchase only the first two installments, and leave the third alone.  I prefer to have Anne and Gilbert live out their literary lives in my imagination, than to poison my memory of them with the drivel that is Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story 
 This jacket is wind and water resistant, but not waterproof.  I was soked through after first rain. I use it mainly for wind block while biking now 
 TOO BAD THERE WASN'T A RATING OF 0 STAR. THIS IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER BOUGHT. FIRST OF ALL WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND CALLED SPORTS AFIELD. THIS ITEM FELL UNDER IT WHEN WE DID A SEARCH. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SOME OFF THE WALL BRAND.THEY WERE PAPER THIN BUT  THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WERE WARM BEING IT WAS FROM AN ARMY AND NAVY STORE. WRONG!!!!!!! THEY SERVED NO PURPOSE AT ALL.WERE NOT WARM AT ALL. .WE WASHED THEM PER DIRECTIOS ON TAG AND SHRUNK SO BAD I DON'T THINK A 2 YR OLD COULD FIT IN THEM.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!JUN 
 I was so disappointed, when I receive the book... I was hoping it has all the stuff together.. I mean the special paper.that shrinks.... so I now has to buy  separate... and has to buy it soon,,, cause I was planning and activity with a lot of kids.... Too bad... that does not say clearly!!!!!

 Wow. I had so much respect for Karajan before these recordings; I still do, but not as much. While before I viewed Karajan as being almost immortal in any interpretation of any symphony, I now know otherwise. If you want a good recording of the first symphony, get the 1964 edition of the "Originals" by Deutsche Grammophon. Karajan conducts that version much better than this one, I mean he totally butchered the first symphony here. As for the 3rd, he also trips. His 3rd symphony is not as textured or multicolored as his other recordings of the 3rd. His 2nd and 4th, while having some merits, is for the most part, dry, muddy, and without the passionate flame and directness that Brahms has to be played with 
 Hollywood made a good attempt. As both an X-men fan and an actor, I can understand complaints from both sides.   The critic in me sees how characters were introduced in the wrong order (Beast and Angel came way before Wolverine or Storm). Some were even missing, such as Gambit. And then Toad and Sabretooth were killed, leaving Magneto with just Mystique.   The actor in me understands how expensive it can get to travel all over, hosting auditions and gathering so many people together for a film, including big names that bring star-power to it: Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Halle Barry, etc.   In the end, I feel the story of the X-men has been around far too long to be done in an incomplete manner. 
 This is the classic Cinderella-like story. A nice plot, well constructed and certainly entertaining. In the tradition of the Revolution Studios, this is a film that obviously seeks to break boundaries and stereotypes, a very praisable purpose, but unfortunately the Ralph Fiennes-Jeniffer Lopez coupling, to me, ends up totally cold and chemistry-less. However it is fun to watch 
 The newest version of Arena is 5.0 . This book teaches based on the version 3.0 
 Star Wars Galaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine written by Voronica Whitney-Robinson with Haden Blackman was the first Star Wars novel published based on a videogame. When I hear about an upcoming movie or novel based on a game, I tend to believe that it will likely be a shallow, cash-in type of affair. Unfortunately, with this novel, that is indeed the case. The feel of the book is that of an overlong and not very compelling advertisement for the massively-multiplayer Star Wars Galaxies game, rather than being a quality read that stands on its own.  The storyline concerns Dusque Mistflier, an Imperial bioengineer who falls in with a mysterious apparent Rebel sympathizer named Finn Darktrin. Dusque is uncertain of the morality of her job and fears the Empire is using her research for nefarious ends. The sudden loss of her closest comrade at the tender mercies of Imperial Stormtroopers throws her over the edge and she's suddenly off on the run with Finn trying to round up a missing holocron for the Rebel Alliance. As they adventure together, a plot twist is foreshadowed MANY times to a point where I can't believe a single reader wouldn't see the ending of the novel coming from miles away.   Dusque and Finn are largely generic character-types like you would find in your typical videogame. They are assigned small quests and have random encounters just like a game. They have boss fights and missions just like a game. In short, there's no organic flow to their story: it feels like arbitrary plot points strung together. Adding to this in a negative way is the shoe-horning into the plot of almost every main film character from the classic trilogy. Vader shows up twice, Luke and Leia bop in and out, Han and Chewie are randomly flying escort to Dusque and Finn at one point, C-3PO is assigned to be a pathfinder droid for the duo (!), and Lando shows up just because a scene takes place in a casino. These cameos add nothing. I did enjoy the cameo of Nym, the pirate from the Starfighter videogames; he felt like a more natural addition to this story, even though he didn't really have anything to do.  The key plot point is hard to reconcile. Would the Rebel Alliance really be so foolish as to encode a holocron (typically a device only used by Jedi or Sith in the rest of the EU) with a full contact list of every spy in their network? This defies the whole concept of organization by cell and doesn't seem very likely. To top it off, they lose this fantastically critical asset and it ends up stuck in a fire pit in a cave? I find this difficult to swallow.  One of the interesting aspects of the book is how frequently it delves into biology and zoology. We are treated to a veritable parade of fauna as the story winds along. Whitney-Robinson has worked as a veterinary assistant and as a marine biologist, so it's easy to see where this focus came from. It does lend the book a bit of much-needed character and distracts from the cardboard-cutout main characters.  I take no joy in writing a review this negative but I simply didn't find much to like about Star Wars Galaxies: The Ruins of Dantooine. Thankfully, this book didn't stop Del Rey from trying a second book based on a videogame, Karen Traviss' superb Republic Commando: Hard Contact. The difference in readability and insight in the novels is dramatic, and I'm not surprised that Traviss was asked to start producing Republic Commando sequels, as her books don't read like a game at all. I'm sorry to say that I could only recommend The Ruins of Dantooine to someone obsessive enough to have to read every Star Wars novel written like myself. 
 This film is a perfect example of how straight action and big-name stars cannot replace the necessity of well written drama.   I will not give away the plot -- although that is admittedly hard to do since there is so little of it. Basically Clooney's character Mr. Ocean, a career burgler, is released from prison with a plan to rob the vault of a Las Vegas casino. So he recruits 11 men, each with a talent to add to the operation. This is where the trouble begins. The viewer is given no reason at all why he should sympathize with any of these characters. There is almost no introduction to many of them, and barely even a mention of their names. Literally half an hour into the film "the eleven" are assembled and they're already robbing the casino. How's that for plot development? And that's basically it ladies and gentlemen: go to Vegas, rob casino, go home, movie over. Some of the "good guys" are even outright repellant. Our would-be heros' enterprise is bankrolled by some greasy Hollywood tycoon. Am I supposed to like this fat weasel?   The only reason we are given to sympathize at all with at least Mr. Ocean, is that the guy he's robbing, the casion owner, is a really bad guy. Supposedly he has people killed 'n stuff. (This actor played a bad guy in Godfather Part 3). But we never see any real evil deeds. In fact, he just seems like a handsome, polite, very prosperous businessman. He manages to raise his voice for just one line in the entire film. Mr. Ocean on the other hand, and his cohorts, are career criminals. But the guy they're robbing is an even greater criminal, you see. So that makes it OK. And really, if you were being robbed, wouldn't you want to be robbed by George Clooney and Brad Pitt? They're such nice guys. That makes getting robbed fun. Just a couple of nice guys stealing from another nice guy. How thrilling.  This entire film is a rushed series of action sequences punctuated by a few soap opera moments with Julia Roberts. There are a few minor things going on in the backgroung, like a boxing match, which are essentially irrelevent. Throughout there seems to be vital information missing (like say, a plot). Soderbergh simply did a terrible job of making me care what happens to Clooney and Roberts.   This film is also horribly cut. Several times what seemed like vital plot details were intoduced, and then completely forgotten about. Take the scene where Pitt and a buddy are casing out the joint and the casino's owner makes an appearence. The folder he has just been handed, explains Pitt, contains secret security codes. You would think that would be something important right? You would think they will need to get those codes. Well, wrong. In fact you won't hear or see a single thing more about them for the rest of the movie. They introduce what seems to be an important detail and then totally abandon it without any development. And that happens all the time in this movie.   In fact Mr. Ocean's team gets down the secure elevator shaft and into the vault with only minor difficulties. (And boy, they started repelling down that shaft quick, didn't they? You didn't even know they were robbing the place yet. Wow, these guys are good. Or maybe Steven Soderbergh is as over-rated as his film.) They make it look easier than breaking into the safe at 7-eleven. This, after Mr. Ocean briefed his crew at the beginning on the nearly impregnable security measures the vault was supposed to have.   One would hope this film would at least end strong. But Soderburgh makes the final scene open ended in such a way as to leave the audience confused and disappointed. We are left wondering whether the "eleven" actually got away with their caper...or worse. What a way to completely overturn the mood of a movie that at least had the merit of being light-hearted. The writer of the screenplay even said as much in the audio commentary to the DVD! (As did the actors in their commentary.)Probably the best moment on this DVD is hearing the screenwriter tell Soderbergh to his face that he screwed up the ending.   I am loath to give either 1 or 5 stars, since hardly anything is absolutely good or bad, but this film comes very close to 1 star. This is your standard artistically worthless Hollywood product. It is big on budget, big on bling, and low on story. I suppose if you just feel like wasting some time, this is as good a way to do it as any. Personally I would rather have a story with more substance 
 I am honestly shocked that not one of the reviews so far written on this page offers any true insight into what a poor offering this album is.  I love Dar and tried over and over to give this album a chance to grow on me but it just does not.  Its only few strongpoints are "Hudson" and "Blue light of the Flame".  Altough "Everyone knows this is Knowhere" is a neat and fun song it fails to do what a truly great cover song sometimes can (provide a brand new look at the original) Cheack out Jonatha Brooke's version of Alan Parson's  "Eye in the sky".   Dar Williams is a great artist.  No artist ( in fact I would venture far enough to say no human being aside from one of the living members of Pink floyd) should EVER cover Comfortably Numb.     Her attempt at doing so is not just a poor choice but a pathetic use of studio time.  Listen to Mortal City and tell me whether this is a good album at all.  Great artists make poor albums that is what this is no matter what she names it.  
 It apparently doesn't strike people as odd that Bush does not belong to a congregation and rarely goes to any church. Too busy? He spends more time on vacation than any President in history. Too disruptive? Carter not only attended a Washington Baptist church every Sunday, but taught Sunday school. Bush isn't alone; Reagan didn't attend church while President, either 
 Before reading this book, I had no idea what Phillip Pullman's personal positions on faith and religion were and that was pretty much what this book was about -- variations on the theme of "Phillip Pullman wrote this series as a rebuttal to C.S. Lewis and Christianity".  I picked this book up because I had so enjoyed Pullman books and had found the previous "Smart Pop" series books I had read so enlightening and mentally stimulating.  Unfortunately, this one did not reach that same level of interest.  I found the majority of the essays to be rather simplistic and very little of what I read made me think.  It was illuminating to hear the underlying philosophy that Pullman brought to his writing, but I would have liked it if they essayists had not all addressed this same topic but had instead looked at other aspects of the book 
 I haven't been too pleased with this program. I think you'd be better to go with 100 Easy lessons. This does not provide a structured methodical program that really teaches how to decode the words. It seems like they jump too quickly through the lessons and I think rely too greatly on site reading. My son did not enjoy the lessons and groaned when I brought the book out. Some of the work pages were fine but overall the program is lacking 
 The movie is dressed with a over serious aura and a pretty dumb but twisty plot, and take all the visual ques from the matrix and cheesy special effects from both daredevil and blade 2 and youve got constantine. Keanu Reeves plays and approaches the same role he did in the matrix. Kind of sucks because had someone else done they wouldve added depth to the charachter instead of butchering it with woodedness. scattered throughout are scenery chewing characters. Gavin Rossdale shouldnt quit day job....on second thought maybe he should stick to acting. The lifeless plot injects little life in the chracters. So what is there left.not much except a few decent action and beo-noir-ish atmospherics. too many times you wish the movie werent so pretentious so you could possibley enjoy whats there 
 A bad album of Big Mike proportions. Generic Ronco beats with a very sloppy Big Mike trying in vain to keep up. I give it an extra star for the comedic effect. I could say its a shame because he used to be great, blah blah blah. Sell out or wash out, the results are the same. Chin the pole Mikey 
 This book was very disappointing.  Aside from the fact that the elements would be very expensive to produce, the designs lacked any strength.  Each project seemed to be more about the designer's ego than about the client.  Additionally, the book's  "icon" layout was cumbersome and meant having to refer to the legend much too often. Granted, some books are more useful than others, but I have never purchased a book that hasn't given me some bit of inspiration, no matter how small... until now.   I found the book and its designs to be much too self-indulgent to be useful.  This is the first book I have ever returned 
 The oven works perfectly when new.  Actual temperature is exactly as shown on the temperature dial.  As the oven is used, the thermostat distorts.  Temperature is lower and lower and lower, actually changing a bit during extended use.  The oven, used twice a week for one hour each time, now heats to 300 degrees when set to 350 degrees - and temperature drops if the oven is used longer.  This seems entirely due to use of a cheap thermostat unit that gradually distorts during use and that never returns to original shape.  Thus the unit will require a good oven thermometer to compensate and monitoring at all times - an intolerable situation.  do NOT buy this oven.While the physical design is superb, the thermostat's gradual cumulative inaccuracy makes this unit undependable for most purposes 
 Again, another interesting pop-corn director that makes a couple of good low budget films and when Hollywood gives to him a free hand (or not so much) things go wrong.  Is not funny, Wilson and Stiller aren't interesting enough and the 70's isn't a good decade to crave for.  With this kind of films, is useful to listen to American critics, they know more about their own culture than us 
 Hollywood quality controlled by the bottom line? Gee, what an original concept. The question is, does Tinseltown point its checkbook any which way new media outlet winds blow or does it take a moral philosophical stance in a chaotic evil-is-hip era defined by a fantasy video game role playing culture of death?   Do most films today suck because they're only made for kids? And should it not matter because they're an easy target audience? That's a cop out. In the days of old Hollywood, moguls created demand across a wide demographic spectrum. Only advances in home media in the past 30 years have disaffected the issue of quality.    Epstein's new age filmic disorder tome basically applies cold harsh statistical reality to a cultural traffic accident and doesn't make a reasonable value judgment on what's happening. He's too busy dotting his is and crossing his ts with stat data to care. His beef is to say that's the way it is. Tough cookies.  As such, stating the facts and stressing the obvious is not rocket science when the largest demographic of Americans in 40 somethings are left out in the cold in ageist exclusion. Mature adults would rather stay at home because suits have decided only kids are worth making movies for. So they fear good filmmaking.  Any entertainment consumer with a clue is staying away in droves because the current generation of talent have no brains, style, taste or creativity for anything except that which will appeal to the lowest common denominator. And when the dream machine's quality control chicken is its egg, apathy becomes its own vice.  So don't blame the the demise of Americana on the rise of home video. Instead, blame the missing vision and low IQ of modern media decision makers and end users. Generations X and Y rule the roost. At the end of the alphabet, only Z is left. Does this signal our end days? Take in the latest 50 Cent flick to decide.  If we live in a world where movies and music contain no more important civil messages and merely serve as escapist pastime and we experience societal downfall as a result, soon there will be no bottom line to speak of. A show business peddling dreck to kids while good will falls to ruin doesn't deserve to survive.  The only useful thing this book has to say is that corporate entities make most of their profits in direct home DVD sales. So if you're making a movie, bypass bohemian green lighters who set the substandards and go straight to digital video. Not only is quality old hat these days. Film itself is an endangered species 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 I would like to thank Joan Peters for confirming that concocting a fraud is still an American tradition.  The fallacious arguments presented in Peters thesis are discredited by her active participation in commiting a fraud.  For anyone really interested in the facts about this book and the Israel-Palestine conflict I highly recommend Norman Finkelstein's book, Image and Reality of the Israel-Palestine Conflict.  Supporters of Joan Peters are simply supporting the disinformation that has lead to the unbalanced opinion of the US today.  The rest of the world recognizes this piece of literature as a fraud.  Please take the time to look at the evidence for yourself at www.normanfinkelstein.com  
 I made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely. The lens is for a variety of Canon cameras but the adapter only works with the A6XX series. My adapter arrived and it doesn't work with my camera. Kinda misleading and now I have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately. Bummer.  Also, Captain Jack is correct about the vignetting. This lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built-in zoom lens. If you zoom wide angle, you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned. If you stay zoomed in, it works ok. Disappointing 
 Those who wrote positve stuff about this book, please tell me why nobody even mentioned that the authors did not give the answers to all the excises in the book? I just can not believe this, am I missing something here? Is this a math book? What am I supposed to do now with those questions 
 Enough said - Netgear can't add 5 cents to the their cost to provide a low profile bracket? Every other major 10/100/1000 brand includes it 
 This is a piece of junk--don't bother. when I originally ordered thought it was Bally's with the Balls at the end. This is just rope with pulleys. Not even elasticized. And really, when you return and have to pay postage, you are paying for the item and getting nothing 
   This is a disappointing book. I had looked forward to what promised from some comments and reviews to be the first important book on the Kennedy assassination since Anthony Summers' Not In Our Time.  I am, readers will note, discounting numerous books since that publication which re-state old evidence, trying to give it some new twist, and conclude Oswald was the lone assassin.   The main merit of this book is that it does not accept the official story of the assassination. However, it attempts to prove a specific alternate theory, and it fails to do so. Along the way, it is pretty dull.   The first fault of this book is that it is poorly written - dull, heavy, and repetitive. The poor writing to which I refer is not just a matter of style. It includes, for example, many examples of saying, after suggesting some line of thought, that the authors will get to that in a later chapter. This is prima facie evidence of poor organization.  The poor writing includes such annoying faults as introducing facts or quotes with phrases like "as Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist said...." Haynes Johnson is introduced three or four times this way. Alert readers will recognize a technique to bolster a claim beyond its merit. In general, one expects such quoted information to stand on its own, not on the citation of a newspaper-marketing award.   The book descends into a almost silly hush-hush tone with a number of footnotes or parenthetical statements about how the authors are protecting the identities of certain people. After making such claims, the authors sometimes proceed to suggest who in fact is involved, the worst example of this being the suggestion that Che Guevara was the CIA's man in Cuba ready to kill Castro.   Another fault of the book is a truly enormous amount of quoted material. This is a lazy-minded practice, a substitute for good analysis. It is also simply padding used to create the kind of fat book many expect on a serious topic like this.  The book brings little that is genuinely new forward. Almost every idea in it has been suggested previously by others, including a number of books on the Mafia as assassins.   The idea that there was a secret C-Day plan (the authors' nickname for a coup and friendly invasion of Cuba being run in top secret by Robert Kennedy) only puts into new words what has been general understanding for years. President Kennedy was a jingo, as was his brother. He embraced the idea of American interference in the affairs of others. He was also part of a family that never accepted defeat with good grace. Neither of the Kennedy brothers would accept the embarrassing defeat of the Bay of Pigs nor the partial-defeat of the resolution to the Cuban missile crisis.   But the book's greatest fault is not proving its thesis. This book has a superficially plausible thesis, that the Mafia infiltrated secret Kennedy plans against Cuba and used the existence of these plans as cover for the assassination, knowing the government would be too embarrassed to reveal the truth afterward.  If indeed the Mafia were behind the Kennedy assassination, then it is doubtful there can be convincing direct evidence left, and indeed the authors fail to produce any. They assemble a complicated story from snippets of still partially-censored government documents and casual remarks. And as all people who have studied the assassination know, the most interesting government documents have never been released or do not exist.   Of course, the Mob doesn't leave filing cabinets full of paper documenting its crimes the way the Nazis did. The best we have had is whispered word that so-in-so said they killed Kennedy.   When you give the authors' thesis a second thought, you realize it is faulty from the start. Why would the government be intimidated about the revelation of its plot in the context of the early 1960s when almost anything anti-Castro was acceptable? Why would the government not go ahead with C-day after the assassination, just using the assassination as cover?    More generally, the CIA's dirty-operations people, armed camps of violent anti-Castro refugees, professional criminals, and other nasty hangers-on were all so tightly bound together in the costly, anti-Castro plots of the early 1960s, it seems inadequate to think of one of the elements, and the smallest element, as separate and influencing exclusively the course of events. Many anti-Castro Cubans themselves hated Kennedy, viewing him as weak in their cause. They didn't need the Mafia, having been generously financed and armed to the teeth by the CIA.    Al Qaeda's future training camps in the mountains of Afghanistan were small, under-financed efforts compared to these American operations involving thousands of people and tens of millions of dollars. It was a giant criminal, terrorist plot financed by government. It failed in its purpose, Castro outlasting two generations of American Presidents, but it managed to kill many people, waste huge amounts of money, and do a great deal of damage.   
 Word had filtered down to me from my many literary sources that Joy Williams' novel, The Quick and The Dead was akin to many of David Lynch's enigmatic and enticing films. Being a huge Lynch fan, I decided to check out her book. Sadly to say, this book was no where near the type of scope that Mr. Lynch works with. I've been reading voraciously for about 35 years and my literary tastes cover a wide spectrum of styles and approaches.  Rarely have I ever had to wade through a book as if it were linguistic molasses. But the Quick and the Dead fits this bill. While some of Ms. Williams' writing styles is quite good, the novel as a whole is a mess. Obnoxious characters that fail to even give the reader a hint of caring about, plots that seem to go nowhere and scenes that are just plain absurd. Most books take me about two days to read at the most. I finally got around to finishing this one about two months after I started it. Only picked it up when I had nothing better to do. Take my advice. If you want to spend money on paper, save it for a few rolls of toilet paper. You'll be more satisfied 
 Generic lyrics kill this album. Nothing separates this band from so many others that are coming out 
 This book is deeply flawed. It foundational premise is utter nonsense. Tarnas has used his vast understanding of the humanties and history and attempted to correlate trends, themes, biographies and events to the movement of planets.   Like all astrologers, he is attempting to merge the scientific and factual using his intuition, seeing corrlations and causes and effects when none exist. The intuitive connection between the scientfic facts and the "facts" of history simply does not work. The supposed correlations  are simply subjective conjecture. And in the final analysis, the over arching question is "so what?".  I found the book very disappointing in light of his brilliant Passion of the Western mind 
 When word that Wolfgang Petersen -- director of such fantastic films as DAS BOOT, ENEMY MINE, and THE PERFECT STORM -- was slated to direct the remake of THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE (now shortened to simply POSEIDON), the sizzling hype around Hollywood was immediately palpable. Production costs for the heavily CGI-laden film skyrocketed to $160 million, making it one of the most costly films of 2005 (released in 2006).   Adding to the costs was an ensemble cast starring Josh Lucas (GLORY ROAD), Kurt Russell (SKY HIGH), Richard Dreyfuss (MR. HOLLAND'S OPUS), Emmy Rossum (THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, 2004), Freddy Rodriguez (LADY IN THE WATER), and Kevin Dillon (24 TV Series).   Now The Poseidon Adventure (1972) wasn't that great a film to begin with, but what it did have was a catchy tune sang by Karen Carpenter ("It's Got To Be The Morning After") and a great human story surrounded by a terrible event: the capsizing of a cruise ship. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, Roddy McDowall, Shelly Winters, and Jack Albertson rounded out that all-star cast. And although the production was a bit cheesy by today's standards, it held at its center a tale of human determination and sacrifice. This was the focus. The destruction of the ship was just the catalyst, not the focal point. Which is where Wolfgang's remake encounters significant problems.   The character set-up in Poseidon is rushed, never giving the audience a sense of empathy or angst for any of the people onboard. More film time is given to the CGI water, fires, explosions, and other non-character items. Many times during the film we are yanked away from the characters in order to watch yet another explosion happen somewhere on the ship, then we're jerked back to the characters who don't really respond to it. So what was the purpose of showing the movie-watcher these things? The simple answer is because it was CGI, it was cool, it cost money, so you have to show it in order to justify your budgetary expenses.   Since we're given so little time to understand or appreciate the characters' interactions with one another, when one of them dies there's no impact for the viewer. Most will probably say, "So what" when this person or that gets snuffed out by the expensive CGI water, fire, or explosion.   Hollywood needs to learn that it's the people in the film audiences care about, not the "totally awesome" special effects. Sure, directors/producers can put the CGI in there and make it look nice, but it has to have an impact on the characters. 
 As the father of 3 open adoption teens and a 4th adoption about to be finalized, I find this book could possibly be discouraging to new adoptive families. Perhaps some of the issues the author deals with apply more to younger children, but none of my sons after reading through this book with me have much good to say about it.  The part about birthdays in particular do not seem to ring true with the older children and it appears that the author still has serious issues of her own at the adult stage 
 Losing Iraq illustrates what went wrong with planning for post-liberation Iraq although not for the reasons its author, a Council on Foreign Relations staffer, intends. In the run-up to the Iraq war, the State Department hired Phillips to moderate seminar discussions among Iraqis. He uses this limited experience to conclude that the cause for difficulty in post-liberation Iraq was not lack of planning but rather a failure to listen. "How could such noble intentions [Iraq's freedom] go so wrong?" he asks. "The White House and Pentagon political appointees thought they could liberate a county without talking to those they were liberating," he replies.  Phillips appears unaware that every Iraqi who met with him also visited the Pentagon, National Security Council, and Central Intelligence Agency. U.S. officials would meet almost daily at the National Security Council, chaired by officials such as Zalmay Khalilzad, then the president's special assistant for Iraq, and Stephen Hadley, then-deputy national security advisor.  Rather than researching and analyzing prewar planning, Losing Iraq becomes a testament to the author's ego and pettiness, features that caused Iraqis and U.S. officials alike to push Phillips aside. He describes Kanan Makiya, with whom he clashed on issues including de-Baathification, as poisoned by neoconservatives who transformed him from an academic to a polemicist. Most Iraqis and Americans differed and questioned whether Phillips's hostility was due to jealousy of Makiya's prominence in fields in which Phillips sought to compete. Phillips also writes that he initiated ideas like a Kirkuk commission to adjudicate competing property claims but was ignored. Actually, such a commission was up and running weeks before his epiphany.  Phillips revises events liberally, saying, for example, that he and Ryan Crocker, deputy assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, opposed the establishment of the Coalition Provisional Authority because it did not empower Iraqis. Actually, Crocker opposed the transfer of sovereignty.  The irony of Phillips's argument is hubris. He chides Bush administration officials for not listening to Iraqis, but he himself did not bother to travel to Baghdad in the wake of Iraq's liberation. Rather, as revealed in a Wall Street Journal review by Rob Pollock, he lifted descriptions from newspapers. His experience in Iraq was limited to a few brief trips to Iraqi Kurdistan before the war, the sheltered guest of a Kurdish politician.  Losing Iraq may try to castigate the White House but instead becomes an example of the arrogance about which so many Iraqis complain. Phillips treats Iraq as a template upon which to lay down his theories. The Iraqi voice is subsumed to his own. If the White House really lost Iraq-the success of the Iraqi elections suggests otherwise-it was because it subordinated the voice of Iraqis to outside advisors like Phillips, more interested in pumping up their own importance than in the welfare of Iraq.

 This book is a quick read, though obviously there is more there. How much, exactly, remains in question. Apparently, others have seen more there than I did, but I think this is one of those books that reflects back at you what you are looking for in it. If one wants to find deep meaning or spirituality, one will find it -- extracting meaning from each picture, each word, each pause. But, I don't know. I found 'The Alchemist' to be much more successful in doing a similar thing. I would recommend that one instead.. 
 A friend lent me Good In Bed when I'd run out of ideas for books to read. I read it, didn't care much for the characters, and ultimately came out of the story feeling worse about life.   A few months later, I came upon this book, and since Weiner's actual writing style wasn't so bad, I thought I'd check it out. I didn't even finish it.   It seems as if Jennifer Weiner writes to make herself feel better when she's down; exalting overweight, plain-faced girls who have a tendency to whine, writing the petite and attractive with overtones of condescencion and contempt, and failing completely to create a male character with more than one and a half dimensions.   That said, this could have been a good story. Weiner does have some talent as a writer... her prose flows easily and is unpretentious, she speaks realistically even when the characters are hardly likeable, and the general ideas of the plot following the sisters' relationship, the connection with their grandmother, and what they do after their falling-out were all fun and interesting. I did very nearly almost care about these characters.   Still, I couldn't actually bring myself to give a hoot about these whiny, one-dimensional people. It's books like this that make me hate chick-lit so much. If you want to read girly stories, I'd rather you go to Barbara Kingsolver or Amy Tan... at least they have brains to back up their talent 
 I can't believe any responsible parent would buy or allow their daughters to read this.  Sexual education about your body should be taught by the parents.  CHILDREN should not be having sex or given INSTRUCTIONS and TIPS on how to do it like this book does. DISGUSTING 
 After hearing and reading a number of astonishing things about this book, I had to give it a read.  What I found was not exactly what I expected.  While some sources have described the Dru character as a "sinister dictator", the truth is not quite so interesting.  The book itself is nowhere near as interesting.  Upon opening the book to the table of contents, one can't help but take notice of the number of chapters in this book.  There are 53 chapters in just 173 pages!  For those of you who don't have a math minor, that's a little over 3 pages per chapter.  And for some reason, many of the chapters are explicit continuations of the chapter before.  What was the point of this?  Why not keep the two chapters a single chapter?   Needless to say, the writing here is atrocious.  The plot is paper-thin, the characters don't develop one iota, and a romance sub-plot rears its ugly head on the last two pages of the book!  How was this book published?  Why was it put into print?  Therein lies the intrigue.  While it was anonymously written at the time, it is today well-known that the author of this book was Colonel Edward Mandell House (he gives a little hint in the text when two characters meet at Mandell House [yeesh!]), who was the virtual co-president of the United States with Woodrow Wilson.  Wilson admitted time and again that House was his "alter ego", even to the point that House was given accomodations in the White House.  Why is all this important?  Philip Dru leads a revolution against the United States government.  Not a bad thing in and of itself, if the reasons had been more compelling.  What happens in the aftermath, however, brings shudders to students of history.  Philip Dru becomes dictator of the United States, without too much reservation.  He tosses out the national constitution, as well as the state constitutions, and has them rewritten.  He institutes a graduated income tax (which did not exist at that time in the U.S. because it was ruled unconstitutional;  however, with the "ratification" of the 16th amendment just a year or two after the publication of this book, we got one for the first time and have lived under it ever since), forces popular election of senators, nationalizes industry, and reorganizes the entire government at his whim.  And Dru is definitely portrayed as the friendly protagonist.  If the First Lady were to write a book calling for revolution, abolition of the constitution, and a unitary dictator, would we worry?  I sure hope so.    But more worrisome is the fact that all of these thing eventually did come to pass in this country.  (Sure, the constitution wasn't abolished and rewritten.  However, the New Deal Supremee Court made rulings that effectively gave Congress carte-blanche to pass ANY law it felt like, even those that explicitly violate the constitution [see USA PATRIOT Act]).  Was House prescient?  Did he simply see the tides of popular opinion swarming over the masses?  Or was he simply one of the many manipulating the domestic policy of our republic behind the scenes?  The structure and execution of this book are amateurish at best, more likened to the writing of a 10th grader than any kind of real author.  Perhaps that is the point.  This book was clearly aimed at the unwashed masses.  Every piece of dialog in this book espouses the benefits of socialism and evil of capitalism.  But this effort is so transparent that it leaves us with nothing of any literary merit, and in its place only political ramblings of a clear Fabian socialist.  These ramblings, of course, entail bringing up relevant issues and injustices (female suffrage, corporate exploitation) and packaging them with solutions that involve only the addition and centralization of power in the federal government.  While those who educate themselves will see this work for what it is, the many people who read this book (not today, since people don't read, but back then there were probably more than a few) would end up buying into bad solutions for exaggerated problems.  There is absolutely no reason to buy this book.  The price simply doesn't justify it.  A reader will gain no enjoyment from it.  This book only redeems itself in its historical context:  it was written by a man who pushed Woodrow Wilson to sign the Federal Reserve Act, which destroyed our economy and continues to devalue our money to this day;  to lead us into World War I, despite his campaign promises not to (the Lusitania was carrying English munitions and was a valid military target); and to attempt to sacrifice the sovereignty of our nation to a world governing body in the League of Nations, which our Congress rightly rejected 
 If they weren't free, I'd give them 1 star.  Media code: MCC 01RG20.  2 of 10 were coasters at 4X with my DVDRW IDE1008 
 I know Batali has become an American icon for Italian cooking, but this book is poorly written and assembled.  It is boring to thumb through with recipies that invite you to close the book and go to another.   I love Italy and both Northern and Southern cuisine, but this just doesn't work for me.  
 4 year, 1 year, and 4 day cycles are used.  Works great except when there is a missed point, or an inversion.  Author recommends his Adam Theory Book.  If Delta Phenonema "pinpoints exact turning points", why would the author advertise the Adam Theory Book?? 
 this is the worst performance i've ever seen. i guess this is a pilot for a tv-show that wasnt picked up. good riddance 
 Mr. Galbraith is smart, accomplished, and learned man who knows what is best for all us.  His view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia.  Rather than a completely coercive state directing the  actions of its citizens to some hirer calling, Mr. Galbraith aims to be  `practical' and just further defines the third way.  Nonetheless, his  proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and  it is more attuned to the European model of society.  Many of his proposals  are so silly you won't take them seriously.  But sadly, he is quite  serious.  For example, Mr. Galbraith states that in a good society everyone  should have a rewarding life.  Of course, he never defines the standard by  which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding.  Neither  does he address what one should do if their life is un-rewarding and what  the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life.   And, of course, who is the `rewarding life judge' and does this judge have  the authority of the state to take something from someone (who has a life  that is deemed too rewarding) for someone who has life that is too  un-rewarding.  Mr. Galbraith fails to convince the reader of the  practicality of his proposals and ends up straddling a line between  socialism and capitalism, and saying nothing new 
 Well I don't know.. after reading the reviews myself, it's clear to me that a certain "type" of person buys this book- one that is largely interested in math.  I am not one of those people, and my review is unique because I am actually in the process of using this book for an introductory math course at the University of Texas at Austin. Let me tell you, I absolutely hate it. It is beyond frustrating- I find the explanations to be extremely vague and confusing, and often find myself looking up secondary sources just to try and figure out what in the world it's talking about. It's not just me, either- the average grade on the first exam was about 47/100, and we were given a HUGE curve. My teacher basically recites from the text verbatim, which is another indictment against this book. I literally cannot find the words to express how much I despise the Heart of Mathematics.  If you are someone who finds themselves in a math course that is using this book, my advice is to switch out IMMEDIATELY. Everyone else- hey, if you like math, this is up your alley, judging by the reviews. 
 It's disturbing when a subpar VHS Dub ruins an otherwise decent movie. Why the dreaded "EP" mode is used for recording movies is beyond me. That tells me that quality is of no concern to the vendor, which in this case is Simitar Entertainment. I would be ashamed if I were selling these to unsuspecting customers--apparently they are not. SP should be the industry standard. Let's face it, if you are buying this movie, its because you want to see Jayne Mansfield. A good quality VHS is all anyone can ask for, and this isn't it 
 I totally agree with what some people have already said here: These recipes never saw a test kitchen. Not only that, whoever wrote them didn't think twice with many of them. The proportions are so outrageously wrong one would think they used some computerized formula to adapt their industrial-kitchen quantities to a 6-serving scale. Take for example their Coconut-peanut sauce. When we had it with their tofu-satay at the Candle Cafe, we thought it was just amazing. Look at the ingredients: 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1/2 coconut milk, 1/4 brown rice vinegar, a thai chili, 2 tbsp chopped cilantro, 2 tbsp chopped mint, 1 tbsp fresh ginger... what could go wrong? Well, add a 1/2 cup of soy sauce and that's what's wrong. All these delicious (and not cheap) ingredients go down the drain because after adding so much (light!) soy sauce the only thing you taste is salt! Of course you blame yourself for not having used your common sense but then... Who edited this book??? I'm sorry, I love the restaurant, but now I cannot wait to go again and ask them that same question to their face 
 I bought this book becasue I thought it was going to be about cosmology, time travel, and relativity.  The first few chapters of the book mostly lived up to my expectations.  Other than being wordy and a bit boring at times the book could stand alone without that dreaded last chapter.    The last chapter was wrong at best, matter of fact, he should re-write it becasue wrong is better than what that chapter actually was.  Gott is too much of an athority on physics to believe all that poo on the Copernican theory.  Even if he does believe it, it didn't belong in this book and seriously detracted from the overall enjoyability of the book.   The reason I gave the book 2 stars instead of 1 is that I do believe in the human manned spaceflight program and do think the US,as a world superpower, should use our massive resources to explore space and the universe.  Space exploration, second only to medicine, should be the most important topic of research in the modern world.    Overall-- save your time and read Stephen Hawking or Brian Greene instead.  
 This book deals with a very important and timely topic.  The Cold War had a major impact on academia, and Price is to be applauded for undertaking such an extensive archival research project to document how these dynamics were manifest in anthropology.  His greatest weakness, however, is an uncritical acceptance of the egalitarian rhetoric of the  Soviet Union and the US Communist Party as signifying a genuine committment to humanitarianism and equality.   This grossly inaccurate assumption underlies Price's key theme in the book:  that the FBI and other security agencies in the United States (aka the bad guys) persecuted leftists and communists (aka the good guys) solely as a means to maintain existing race and class hierarchies in the United States.  Anyone with a passing familiarity with the violence and aggression of communist party politics in the 1930s, or the history of the Soviet Union (including its genocidal approach to ethnic minorities within its own borders) should realize this is quite a crock.  Price is certainly not alone in his myopia in this area:  his assumptions reiterate many cherised illusions of the Left.  While these shortcomings may have been forgivable in the past when knowledge about the Soviet Union was more uncertain, any contemporary scholar who ignores the overhwelming array of evidence and testimonials that have emerged from Soviet archives since the end of the Cold War renders himself and his work largely irrelevant to contemporary academic debates in this area.  In that sense, Price's work fits in well with earlier anthropological activists, such as those who militantly defended the Rosenbergs as innocent victims of anti-Semitism and US Cold War hysteria.  Soviet archives have shown, of course, that the Rosenbergs were quite guilty and their defenders in academia were willingly duped by the barrage of Soviet propaganda released on their behalf.   Price continues to reiterate the same theme in his work, never once considering that a peek in the Soviet archives might offer interesting revisions to his assumptions.  Did the KGB maintain files on Franz Boas, Margaret Mead and Gene Weltfish?   This book would make a much greater and more lasting contribution to Cold War scholarship if the author had even a token awareness of the Soviet side of things.  Unfortunately, like so  many leftists, he is more intent on using FOIA to bash the United States rather than to undertake a serious analysis of the way anthropology became suspended (or distorted) between rival superpowers during the Cold War.  For an insightful and disturbing account of how these dynamics have influenced other social sciences,  see Harvy Klehr and John Haynes recent book "In Denial:  Historians, Communism and Espionage."  It is much more enlightening than Price's work 
 **This review pertains to the audiobook version, not the print version.**   The narrator (Mirron Willis) does splendid voice characterizations for all of the characters -American, British, Ugandan...  All except for the Scot, Nicholas Garrigan.  Willis makes the Scottish doctor sound mildly retarded or speech-impaired (or both?).  Unfortunately, since the doctor's voice predominates throughout the book, I just couldn't bear listening to the whole thing.  Too bad.. 
 As a diehard Red Sox fan, how could I go wrong with a book documenting the 2004 season?  The answer:  Stephen O'Nan.  He spends more time espousing outrageous conspiracy theories (that MLB is routinely fixing games to get postseason matchups) making up silly nicknames for players that no one else on the planet uses, and generally spouting personal anecdotes that do not provide any insight or even useful description of the famed season.  Stephen King, on the other hand, does a terrific job.  Unfortunately it is O'Nan who provides the bulk of the content.  As a committed baseball fan I routinely found O'Nan's lack of understanding of the subtleties of the game to be infuriating.  Basically this guys is not qualified to be writing any sort of non-fiction book about the sport.  That said, there is one redeeming aspect (in addition to Stephen King's portions) to the book.  It brought back that wonderful season - as I plowed through, I remembered where I was and what I was doing at each critical juncture.  I remebered the anguish and the joy - conjured back by the images in the book.  Worth reading?  I think so - though I reccomend the strategy of keeping the book out and picking a chapter randomly every now and again.  This allows you to re-live the moments with small doses of O'Nan's idiocy 
 From my perspective, Mayers does not offer much to apologetic discussion except to debunk purest evidentialists and purest presuppositionalists.  As I have been a convinced Van Tillian presuppositionalist for about a year and a half, I don't see that Mayers offers anything that Van Til himself has not already offered.  Van Tillians do not reject the use of evidences in apologetics, but they work to see them within a proper theological and anthropological viewpoint.  God has revealed Himself in the world, but as man is gripped by the noetic effects of sin, he will not receive those evidences as being valid apart from the gift of God changing their broken will.  Is Mayers trying to dissuade people from a Kuyper-eque denial of the need for apologetics?  Though this view is a threat to apologetics, it seems to be a minority opinion even among presuppositionalist Reformed theologians.  I just don't see the point of this book unless he is trying to reach a broader audience (at least on the presuppositionalist side), maybe of Van Tillians.  As a Van Tillian, expecting to be told to "lighten up," I was confused because Mayers seemed very presuppositional in many points though he worked diligently to show that he wasn't a presuppositionalist.  I don't think Mayers has much new to say to those who are already convinced of the biblical case for Van Til's apologetic.   Though Mayers seems to want to stress the equality of presuppositions and evidences the fact that evidences are interpreted through our presuppositions continually shines through.  After reading Mayers' book, I continue to be convinced that presuppositions rule the day.  Yes evidences are important, but are impotent unless the presuppositions of the heart are changed.  Just as the will of man, though real, is eclipsed by the will of God, so evidences, being true, are eclipsed by the presuppositions that interpret them.  Though I found Mayers to affirm much of Van Til, I was disappointed by the lack of practical application of Mayers' apologetic.  I am disappointed that Mayers did not deal with things like the transcendental argument in light of his view of evidences.  It is clear from reading the book that God has revealed Himself in the world, but man sufferers under the noetic effects of sin, they will not receive those evidences as valid apart from the gift of God into their broken will.  Overall, I did not find the book to be helpful.  I'd stick with Van Til, Bahnsen, and Frame 
 This book should be called "Johnny Depp" because it is more about her relationship with him than about herself. I expected a biography on her life but it's about how this super-waif got famous and then those who made her famous turned against her. Then the rest of the book was about her unhappy relationship with Johnny Depp. I really like Kate Moss and would like to have read a book about her...not her ex-boyfriend. 
 I personally only like one song on this album and that is the first one.  The rest of the songs I think are boring.  I like the slow pace of the songs but they lack alot of melody and chorus for all the other songs 
 As fans of 'Starship Troopers' know, the very name 'Starship Troopers' implies a galaxy-sweeping epic with lots of violence, gore, heroism, humor, drama and tons of big-budget special effects.  This one is limited to one location, his lots of gore but  little in the humor, drama and big-budget special effects department.  One has to wonder at the thought processes in Hollywood. 'Starship Troopers' was a big success. Sure, it was expensive, but it is also a regular staple on cable TV and it continues to sell well (#2500 or so on Amazon in DVD sells as of today - which isn't bad for a 10 year old movie).  One would think that a Starship Troopers 2 would have been in the works for a long time - perhaps a final push to the bug home system. Instead, according to the director's commentary track, the special effects director of the original Starship Troopers came up with this simple, low-budget plot that he wanted to direct.  Somehow sold it to the powers-that-be at Sony and they backed it, provided that he slash his already bare bones budget even more.   So, what do you get when you give Starship Troopers 2 a budget that is only 5% (yes - five percent!) the size of the original movie? A bad movie full of special effects tricks that you are most likely to see in 50s sci-fi cult classics. The movie's premise changes from being a war epic to being a haunted castle movie, a premise that the producers and director freely admit to on the director's track. They also admit to it being a "B movie" and that it was intentionally filmed to go straight to DVD. Some reviewers have made comments about it being a poorly-lit movie. That was also intentional - poor lighting means that the movie's special effects can be of lesser quality. Unfortunately, one of Tippett's other compensations for a low budget is to add more blood to every scene in the last half of the movie. It gets silly after a while, rather than dramatic.  The movie is derivative of several other movies and TV shows including:  -Star Trek: TNG. Remember the plot that Picard uncovered in which aliens were physically inserting themselves into the brains of high-ranking members of Star Fleet? Well, I hate to write a spoiler, but...  X-Files. Same as a above  Aliens - there's a scene that just steals from the one in which the Paul Reiser character drops an alien into Ripley's sleeping quarters.  Alien - the dark sets with a creepy monster about.  John Carpenter's 'The Thing' - the premise of being an outpost cut off from the rest of humanity while an alien takes people over one by one. The scene where the General is chased into the base steals from the one in which the dog in 'The Thing' is chased to the Antarctic research lab by the helicopter.   Brenda Strong comes to this movie as a familiar face, but not as the same character. Her character in the original Troopers was a fleet captain who died a horrible death. In this one she is an army sergeant. No one is quite sure why they felt the need to have a face from the first mivie but she does a good job and on the director's track they credit her with making this movie shoot a positive experience on a lot of levels. That makes it all the more bizarre that her name is not listed on the cover of the DVD or on the back cover credits. Too bad - her character was just about the closest thing that I found to believable in the whole movie.  I give this two stars rather than one because I found the director's/producer's track to be quite fascinating. Maybe it should only be watched with that track playing.  I give this one a D-. It fails to deliver on the promise of the original in so many ways 
 Ugh! I made it through forty minutes when, having reached my limit of 1500 cliches per film, I gave up. What a shallow piece of tripe! I should have known at the very beginning when a woman who had apparently lost a family member to a traffic accident said, mournfully, that she could no longer get "close to anyone" for fear they would be "taken away." It goes downhill from there, folks, if such a thing can be imagined 
 I'd read most of King's stuff during the uh decade of  my UTe.  Salem's  Lot and Pet Cemetery being  the hook on the line and     The Stand, Shining, Christine  and   IT reeling me in.  I thought he'd never come out with a book  that I didn't want to read cept anything of or related to his wife's stuff and the Gunslinger series.    Then one day I started to read Insomnia and I couldn't make it to the halfway point, the antiChristian Proabortion garbage was too thick for me to ignore and I found myself throwing Insomnia away, I did that with Cider House Rules by John Irving too.  Even Needful things with it's anti evangelical stuff could be ignored cause there is some truth to the anti Catholism and hypocrisy  but Insomnia was just plain mean spirited. 
  The last time that I wrote up one of Martha Grimes books (Belle Ruin) I mentioned that I thought that her move to America and possibly her getting a new editor had greatly improved her books. I said that I was looking forward to future improvements to her style and plot development.  It is obvious that Martha has decided to fire the new editor and has gone back to her old ways of inserting meaningless chapters into her books for the purpose of enlarging their size. These inserts are supposed to be humorous I gather. They are not. She has also decided that she wants to court the people of Hollywood who are looking for books with little or no plot for them to convert into the pabulum of the mindless. There are no car chases in this book, however the main character and the gorgeous (naturally) police DI seem to jump into bed every time that they meet on the street or at a crime scene.  I am sorry that I gave Martha another chance.  It is my impression that Martha thinks that this is a mystery. I think my catagory of "Humor" is what she really attempted and failed.  It is really unfortunate because she has shown that she has the ability to put together a gripping mystery tale if she ever wants to. 
  This book is as others have stated an emotional plea rather than an academic work.  Yes, I believe the Holocaust was a reality but this work only leads me into denial owing to the he said she said argument.  Where are the facts, footnotes, and scholarship?  I would pass this book over, a waste of time and money. 
 Judith Butler is out of her depth in her discussions of Israel, and (the new) anti-semitism.Readers searching for understanding of post-9/11 politics will encounter lopsided arguments here 
 As a university professor of human resource development and an Anglican brother, The Amazing Power of Deliberate Intent is pure drivel and has no redeeming value whatsoever. If you enjoy new-age fantasy, get a copy from your local library otherwise do not waste your money. If you are serious about spiritual growth you might read works such as The Rule of Benedict: Insights for the Ages, or the best selling book on spiritual development of all time.. it's called the Bible 
 A few days ago I was delighted to learn The Stepford Wives would be shown on cable TV, but I soon realized I was watching a turkey. The opening scene is a heavy handed parody of the Jerry Springer show, and from that point it's downhill all the way.   The plot is weak, the characters inconsistent, and the story incoherent. The production values of casting, costuming and set design are certainly high. But that just makes this movie a pointless, glossy mess 
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 Why did Mr. Bernstein come up with such a meager product?--as though someone with an "in" suggested, "Hey, there's a commercial niche for a small book on Jefferson.  Give it a go."  I wish he hadn't.  He gave little substance either to Jefferson or his book and made factual and interpretative missteps in the bargain.  Save your money. 
 As have other reviewers, I found this book gives enough information to get me in trouble or to get me frustrated but doesn't give enough details or explanations or even examples to get me out of them.  You could do several things using the book but if you tried to do something very different from what he illustrated you'd probably get mysterious error messages and little or no help understanding what the problem is.  I have used the Missing Manual for going from Windows to Mac and found it far more helpful than this book.  I'd urge you to spend a bit more and get something much more complete.  I just bought "Applescript The Definitive Guide (2'nd. ed.)" by M. Neuburg and I'm hopeful it will meet my needs.  I notice there are several other books available here for beginners and I'd consider some of them before getting this one 
 This man was a fraud and racist of the most sinister class. He and his group of hate mongers used to chant to send "hate vibrations" into Black communities so that we would kill each other. He stands in a long line of confused, sick people who became fascinated by (and eventually set out to distort) the religious mythology of ancient Kemet (Egypt). If you buy this book it should be to burn it 
   Though well written and interesting I did not enjoy this book. It saddens me that this country constantly attacks pro-lifers.                                                                                                                                               No, being pro-life isn't about "saving pweshus baybeez", it's about how much we honor someones (anyones) right to live. Killing the child in your womb is the same as killing the child you have. Worse because the one in your womb cannot defend itself. Many women complain that they can't afford another child and wouldn't be able to give it the life  they would want to. However there are so many childless couples who are very willing to adopt so why abort when you can give your child a better life?  Did you know that only 1% of abortions are cause of rape or incest? So why are there 1.6 million abortions per year in the U.S. alone? One of the leading causes is because the mother simply does not want more children. Again they can give the child up for adoption since they don't want it.                                                                                                                                                   Last but not least the parts concerning a pro-life "hidden agenda" and criminal rates dropping are (with all respect) simply ridiculous. There is no such thing as a "hidden agenda" and I think that criminal rates dropping is (if not stupid) possible but there might have also been future presidents, activists, missionaries and leaders that have been aborted too.   
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 I'll admit it, the title got me. I probably read two business books a year, and this one didn't offer anything new. Most of it was new twists on the same old rules. It was not inspiring, motivating, or compelling 
 I think that generally Dover Books are to be congratulated on reprinting many books that otherwise might never be seen again and priced very reasonably too.  I don't think any plaudits are in order on this book though.   I found the text very dull and the pictures gave an overall impression of blackness.  Hugh Ferris managed to develop a wonderful rendering technique (being trained as an architect no doubt helped) that seemed so suited to commercial buildings of size, especially skyscrapers.  His black and white artwork is simply stunning but it needs to be printed on quality paper to bring out the subtleties of grey shading.  The main problem with the book is the paper does nothing for his work and I was really made aware of this when I recently bought 'Power in Buildings' (ISBN 0940512114) a lovely reprint of his 1953 book.  The fourth of his famous renderings from Evolution of the Set-back Building appears in both books but in the 'Power' edition the image looks so right.  His writing in 'Metropolis' came across as very long-winded, for example, this is from the last page of the book: 'As for personal and specific proposals, the author well knows how many parapets, other than the one we are now leaving, overlook the imaginary "Metropolis of Tomorrow" and he shares the common belief that few of the many visualizations currently being formulated can contribute more than a particle to the ultimate actuality' The ten pages of words and pictures devoted to Set-back I thought the most interesting part of what he had to say.  Get his 'Power' book for a much better appreciation of his architectural thoughts and the fifty main renderings really look beautiful on good paper.   
 I have seen a lot of erotic photograph books wanting to become a photograph myself. I would have to say this is one of the worst. The book is book in size, but each photograph is the size of and is a poloroid. The pictures are blurry many times and so small it is hard to tell anything about the context of the picture. This book was a waste of paper and will be a waste of your time 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 I'm pretty sure this book wasn't written for the 'average' reader, and that's OK. However, if you're not particularly fond of poetry or accustomed to reading it, this book seems like an exercise in style, and not much else.  The big problem with the story is the characters: They're cliché and boring. To his credit, Seth does manage to paint a decent picture of the San Francisco Bay Area with it's stereotypical people, but after reading the first few chapters and realizing that the main character was a blah 20-something tech-yuppie pretty boy who acted like he was having a mid-life crisis, I pretty much lost interest (Like, I should feel bad for this spoiled dork?!). Then he threw in a bunch of stereotypical San Francisco characters ([...] Guy, Asian Artist-girl, mellow Wine-Country Guy etc) and went absolutely nowhere interesting with it. It's as if Seth wanted to write about the city of San Francisco, but having just moved there he didn't know anybody interesting, so instead he took a bunch cardboard characters and wrote a boring upper-middle-class soap opera. One reviewer claimed this was `satire', yeah, right.  I fully agree with another reviewer who recommended Amistead Maupin's Tales of the City over this.   
 I also found the bar scene track when Falco tells his team his out on the Miss Congeniality CD!  Go fish 
 After my older brother suddenly died of coronary artery disease at age 40 due to genetically high cholesterol, I needed to learn everything possible on the subject so that I could avoid suffering the same fate.  I read all the books on the shelf, among them Dr. Ornish's.  I disliked this book because it is rather narcissistic and is focused more on Dr. Ornish himself than on educating us about how to avoid heart disease.  Take a look at chapter 1 and you'll see what I mean: "I was trained to treat hypertension..."; "I first became interested in conducting research on heart disease in 1975..."; "I began to wonder..."; "I went to the medical library and began reading extensively"; "It seemed like an exciting opportunity, so in 1977 I decided to take a year off..."; "I hadn't had enough clinical experience to be jaded..."; "I was unwittingly giving many of them hope for the first time since their illness had been diagnosed"; "I went back to medical school and graduated in 1980"; "From 1981 to 1984, I completed my internship and medical residency in Boston."; "In July 1984, I moved to San Francisco..."  This is just the tedious first six pages.  Trust me, it goes on and on like this.  Do you want to learn about how the heart works?  You'll finally get a few sentences on that subject when you get to page 42, squeezed in between more "I did this and I did that."  You'll get a little info on LDL and HDL when you get to page 51.  Sure, there is useful information within the 672 pages of this book, but you'll be forced to become an expert on Dr. Ornish and his life story to find it.  And remember, this book is more than 15 years old.  Perhaps back in 1990 he needed to devote 300 pages to convincing people that he was correct in believing that diet, exercise, and stress affect your risk of heart disease, but that that is common knowledge and not controversial now.  The research is far more advanced in today's world.  If you are interested in Dr. Ornish personally and the history of the study of heart disease in the 1970s and 1980s, you'll probably enjoy this book.  But if you are serious about educating yourself on heart disease and how best to avoid it, I would recommend Dr. Robert Superko's "Before the Heart Attacks : A Revolutionary Approach to Detecting, Preventing, and Even Reversing Heart Disease" (2003) or Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz's "The Expert Guide to Beating Heart Disease: What You Absolutely Must Know" (2005).  These books are more up to date and provide far more useful information. 
 I purchased this along with the matching Barbie and Kelly dolls for my five year old.  Although no toy is ever easy to get out of the packaging anymore, these were the most difficult.  The pegasus was the most difficult of the three.  I cut my fingers twice trying to get it out.   My daughter was very excited to receive this pretty horse but quickly became frustrated because, as others have noted, the wings and the saddle do not stay put! The eclosed instructions recommend replacing the batteries upon purchase.  The problem is that it takes button cell batteries.  I think that most people (like myself)do not keep this type of battery on hand!  The Barbie also takes the same kind of battery. Although it is a very pretty toy, it is extremely frustrating.  I would not recommmend this toy to anyone 
 I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it.  After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw.  After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book.  It found it's way to the trash can.  Don't waste your time on this 
 Love this movie BUT the transfer was so pathetic that I returned it to the vendor. This DVD is absolutely the WORST transfer I have ever seen. MGM goofed on this classic 
 i was origionally turned on to this book after hearing about it on VH1. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed upon reading it. She just sounds like an annoying "boy crazy" teen. I somewhat expected that, and it would have been managable if there was any substance or real "juice" to the anecdotes 
 Spends more time promoteing the authors instead of teaching you how to actually design 
 As a year-round resident of a New Jersey shore community, I thought "The Big House," the history of a summer home in a Cape Cod community, would make for an interesting summer read. WRONG!  I have never read a book with such interesting potential that was so full of so many endless, boring details. The author goes to great lengths to describe in excruciating detail every brick, every shingle, every splinter, and every nail that forms the construction of the house; in addition to every cobweb in the house's endless corridors; every page in every book that resides on every shelf in every room; and every blade of grass, every tree, each individual leaf on every tree, and every weed that surrounds The Big House, to the point where you just want to scream "WILL YOU PLEASE GET ON WITH IT! DOES THE FAMILY MANAGE TO KEEP THE HOUSE, OR DOESN'T IT?"  Unlike one other reviewer who gave up on all of this endless detail after reading 75% of the book, I forced myself to finish it because, despite all the detail, I still wanted to find out whether the family managed to hang onto the property. I won't spoil the ending by revealing it here, but future readers may want to save themselves many hours of boring toil and sweat by stopping by their local library, removing the book from the shelf, reading the last few pages to learn who keeps or does not keep the house, and then returning the book to the shelf.  The dust jacket of this book proudly displays a seal that proclaims the book to be a "National Book Award Finalist," and the major benefit I received from wading through all that detail was the realization that if this author could manage to get this book published AND have it become a National Book Award Finalist, then I could do the same, and I have finally begun to write my own memoir that I have been meaning to get around to for the past 30 years. If this author can do it, so can I!  Thank you, George Howe Colt!  
 This movie was surprisingly bad. Despite the generally positive reviews from Amazon, and the combined force of Johnny Depp and Christopher Walken, I couldn't wait for "Nick of Time" to end.  First off, the plot was so absurd, it was laughable. I don't usually like when somebody calls a movie unrealistic, but "Nick of Time" was exactly that. It is nearly impossible to enjoy the film given the ridiculous story line. Even if you manage to get past the story line, the movie is not suspenseful in any way. You'll predict the ending after the first five minutes.  Secondly, although I love both Walken and Depp, neither is at their best in this film. I can't even blame them given the poor script. This story would make the performance of any actor hard to believe.  Finally, there are absolutely no redeeming qualities from the film. I've seen movies that were altogether much worse, that had at least something I found interesting. This movie just didn't have anything at all.   I would recommend you avoid this film, because you most definitely will be disappointed. If you are a fan of Walken and Depp as I am, avoid it anyway. You can find these two in a ton of other excellent movies.  
 While this was nowhere near as bad as IMPOSSIBLE, this was just boring and very repetitive.  And the end - the storm - wasn't that in Bittersweet?  A storm on a yacht and the hero comes to claim the heroine??  I have read Danielle Steel for half my life now.....named my daughter after her....but I long for the day when I can say "She's BACK! 
 There are two versions for this film , which is not generally known.  Someone selling it should.  I was not informed when I bought the G rated version.  THe repy I received was, "too bad. 
 Terrible, terrible, terrible. First of all, the cover is completely different. It looks like it was made in Wittenberg's basement.  Nevertheless, we shouldn't judge a book by its cover.   This is weak in content. Absolutely weak. It will not help you gain any insight on social work. It's descriptions are pathetic. For example: "Physical child abuse means that some physical damage is done to a child" (Page 93).  It doesn't get deeper than that, seriously. It is very bland. Worst of all, it repeats itself over and over. I was very disappointed.   Don't waste your money. This book is not for written for the scholarly. You won't learn a thing 
 There's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject, but Mr. Winchester abuses the privilege. There's no digression too minute, no reference too arcane, no place where one word can't be replaced with 100. When he does finally get to a set of pertinent points, the writing is excellent. That's what kept me from giving it a worse review. Too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of economy-brand mixed nuts.   If you're prepared to work your way through the innumerable detractions and root out the nuggets, the book is worth your time. Otherwise, pass on it.  
 I enjoyed The Illuminator, however, like some other reviewers had problems with it. While not a middle ages expert, even my novice eye was attracted to absurd name choices. My MAIN concern is this book parallels Anya Seton's Katherine so much that I TRULY felt uncomfortable. While John of Gaunt and Julian of Norich are real historical figures their "voice" in The Illuminator too closely paralled Seton's. About a fourth of the way through the book, I desperately checked the Acknowlegements section for credit to Seton and Katherine- none was given! It almost seems as if a copy of Katherine was at the elbow of this author. Basically, the illuminator IS Katherine, but told from a different point of view. As one reviewer noted, names seem either ubsurd or "ripped off" i.e Rebekka (Ivanhoe) and Kathryn (Katherine). Perhaps someone should check into this....again, I did enjoy the book, but since I had just read Katherine before The Illuminator I was consistently distracted by the TOO many similarities. 
 I put the Sunforce 50012 inside my car's windscreen and plugged it into the cigar lighter.  (On this car the cigar lighter is "live" even when the ignition is off).  The Sunforce 50012 worked for one day.  Next day it appeared dead (There is blue LED that blinks when it is working).  I picked it up, it started working, sat it down, it quite.  Twisted it, it worked, then it didn't, then it did.  The old intermitant (sp) connection problem.  Basically it was shot, dead, kaput, trash it.  Long story short, I fixed it by taking it apart and re-soldering components.  I am smart and lucky with nothing better to do.  99.999% of the users could not make this fix.  So just forget about it.  This thing is garbage 
 This is basically a  digital photography book which uses nude women for the accompanying photos. If the author had chosen to use pictures of puppies and children the book would essentially be then same. That said, it's not a bad book, although somewhat basic, on digital photography. If you are looking for a book on nude photography go elsewhere 
 I am currently studying CS at university and one of my classes in HCI.  All I can say about this book is that even the tutor for the class hated this book - as did all the students - so much so that the next semesters' book is going to be something else 
 Compiling two specials made for TNT, and Chuck Jones' 1941 "Horton Hatches The Egg" (From his early Disney-like peroid) to boot, it's nothing more than a thrownaway! Get the DVD of "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" and "Horton Hears A Who" instead 
 Roberts' little fable pits a wholly benign free-trade against absolute protectionism and guess which one looks better.  Based on the theories of David Ricardo, the fable assumes that every worker in the world is always treated fairly and every boss is kind and responsible.  In The Choice there are no sweat shops and no corrupt CEOs.  Fables like The Choice (or the "free-market economy" for that matter) are easy to believe because we want the world to be that simple.  That's why the book is dangerous.  The Choice has almost nothing to do with the real world, but it sounds good.  The argument is so seamless that it appears almost unassailable.  If you buy Roberts' version of Ricardo, however, you must accept Wal-Mart as the epitome of business virtue.  Roberts may be a great guy, and he certainly writes well.  Unfortunately, his book begins with a series of fallacious premises and works its way toward a conclusion that is simple, elegant, and horribly wrong 
 If you know the physiology, and want to review, get a little deeper, then OK, BUT COME ON. Have the other reviewers used this book to learn physiology from. The writing is horrible, the book needs an editor. Perhaps the writers should have taken some more writing classes, and less physiology when they were in college.   Don't use this book to learn physiology! It just bombards you with facts (like I said, a reference manual) but is horrible at explaining concepts, so then you just sort of memorize, memorize for exams, and a month later you can't remember anything, because it's such a mess in your head.   
 I didn't find this book very useful.  The marketing and strategy considerations are very basic and didn't give me a lot of new insight into brand creation.  The examples that he uses from other industries border on trite and are much better illustrated elsewhere.  If you are starting from scratch, however, it may be an interesting place to start.  It asks some of the basic questions that an entrepreneur needs to answer and has some entertainment value, albeit with frequent and not-so-subtle doses of self-promotion 
 This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read.  I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book.  I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through.  This one has gotten on my last nerve.  I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable.  But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books.  It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them 
 I've read only a few of Hillerman's previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. I've enjoyed what I've rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don't indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee' phase.   From what I gather, 'Skeleton Man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman's last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment. 'Skeleton Man' starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life'(See Nelson De Mille's 'Night Fall'), Hillerman fails here. The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called 'action'. Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story. The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman's earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee's wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived 'Superman rescues Lois' situations.  Better to stick with Hillerman's earlier novels. The 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits Hillerman, I'm afraid 
 This is one of the most influential and most useless books on Hitchcock. The book is very telling, not of its subject matter, but of the author. Sadly, the book received a lot of undue attention and its misconceptions have still not sufficiently diappeared. Absolutely horrendous 
 this book is contrarian to a fault.  i think the author purposely incites controversy.  the bottom line is this: every individual's financial circumstances vary and no one answer is correct for everybody.  if you have student loans at 8% and a mortgage at 9%, it makes more sense obviously to pay down the higher debt, deductions be damned.  many people make stupid mistakes such as making buying decisions based on tax deductions  without thinking about the consequences to their budgets.  they leave out property taxes, maintanence, etc. that adds up.  for most people, paying down other debts first may make sense, but to keep your mortgage unpaid in the hopes of making double-digit returns in the market is foolish...it is much more complicated than that.  there is your tax bracket, fees and expenses, time frame, investment risk, etc.  such blanket statements are foolish for edelman to make.  also, roth IRA's can make alot of sense to those people who qualify for them; his argument to not invest in it is weak at best and is based on loose assumptions.  also, in many parts of the country, buying a starter home/townhome can make alot of sense.  you can sell it for a decent profit in many cases, at least if you stay more than a couple of years.  this beats renting anyday, and in his arguments he never addresses the real losses of renting, including the increase in the annual rent which in some markets can be exorbitant.  anyway, read it and draw your own conclusions.  there is never a substitute for common sense. 
 For a 2-disc, director's cut, my expectations were perhaps too high for this DVD.  Nevertheless, I was appalled at the poor quality of the transfer.  The colors were dull throughout, and focus was frequently not at the beginning of scenes.    For the movie itself, I don't agree that it is holding up well over time.  At 25 years old, the movie just has limited entertainment value for people who aren't waiting for their beloved canceled TV series to be on the big screen.  There's no question that II and IV are the best of the series, but comparing it to other Star Trek original cast movies isn't putting the bar very high.  My interest in watching this again was just having finished Melville's Moby Dick, the final scenes of which Khan repeats liberally during the final space battle.  That said, I think Montalban was fantastic as the revenged-obsessed Khan and very evocative of Ahab.  However, Shatner's pretentious Kirk just becomes more grating as time goes on.  The original cast schtick just doesn't make for a compelling drama 
 I purchased this pair of earrings for my 5 year-old granddaughter to wear as the flower girl in my niece's wedding.  When the purchase arrived, they were too small for my granddaughter.  Therefore I had to return them 
 When I received this book in the mail, I was shocked at how cheaply it had been printed. Anyone familiar with the cheap cardboard backed books put out by another catholic publishing house that I won't mention, will recognize the similiar handiwork here. The paper is of the poorest quality, the binding is destined to crack with little use, etc. This is hardly worth the [money] charged. The two week cycle of prayer used here will quickly become monotonous to most diligent practitioners of regular prayer. If you are serious about starting the Hours, invest in Phyllis Tickle's "Divine Hours" here at Amazon 
 When my Krups coffee grinder finally expired after several years of faithful service, I decided to order the Capresso because of its larger capacity and vaunted "cool grind."  I wish I had ordered the  Krups instead.  The Capresso takes much longer to grind the coffee, and the  design ensures that no matter how careful you are, you will spill ground  coffee all over your counter.  In the time since I bought it another  reviewer has reported that his or her Capresso broke within six months.  Do  not buy this model 
 This DVD is edited from the original version.  This movie is HOT, the cut DVD is NOT 
 Flayderman's has not revised gun values since 2001.  They put a date on the reverse of the fly page of 2004, but it just a re-print of the one compiled in 2000 and printed in 2001.  I hope others are not fooled like I was thinking they are getting an updated book.  I feel I wasted my money.  Gun values have changed too much in the last few years, and I find this book worthless 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Although John Stanley's book covers a lot of great movies, there are many problems with the overall context. For example, he seems to only have a vague recollection of a lot of the movies. Because, a lot of reviews get the stories completely wrong. (HELP's plot is not about the Beatles looking for Ringo's magic ring. Everybody knows that!)Some actors are credited with the wrong roles. Also, there are many glaring spelling errors and a slight continuity problem: A title will say "see altertnate title", and that title and review would not be in the book! Mr. Stanley, do a little more research on your films and a more careful job of copy editing and you'll have an invaluable book. The more I read your current volume, the more mistakes I find and the more I feel I could write a better book myself 
 This book was perfectly awful. If it was possible I would have givin it zero stars. I am in the eighth grade and none of the people in my school act like this.  People might be thinking this but don't actually say it out loud.  This book was also degrading towards both boys and girls.  The one charactor in this book who I actually liked was Marcaline.  I don't recomend this book for people of of any age and anyone under 15 should absolutly not read it!  Save yourself the time and put this book where it belongs.  In the trash can 
 Whew!  After reading other reviewer's remarks, I'm glad to see I was not the only one who thought this movie was crap.  The cinematography is great, and the look (art direction) is authentic.  I too had trouble following the double-storyline.  Just when I started to get interested in the modern-day story, the action cut back to the past.  I don't know if it was poor choices during the editing processes or what.  I have seen many other movies that use flashback and dual-timeline stories.  None of those were this boring.  By the time you get to discover the real truth behind the century-old murders, you really don't care anymore.  And I don't see how the climactic storm at sea resolves the modern-day storyline.  In terms of casting, I have to agree with the other reviewers: why cast two British actress as the modern-day leads.  To me, the character of Jean should've been played with either an American actress (or at least a British or Australian actress with an American accent)instead of Catherine McCormick.  I also couldn't begin to identify with the character.  She seems so obsessed over this murder but completely inarticulate when discussing it (unless that's the point).  Sean Penn sits around and broods as her husband, a has-been poet.  Josh Lucas and Elizabeth Hurley (as Sean Penn's brother and the brother's girlfriend) really don't have much to do except add some eye candy (Josh for the ladies, and Elizabeth for the guys, and believe me, I kept wanting to see more of her in the bathing suit -- with and without the top).  Some say Josh Lucas's acting is a bit wooden and stiff in this role; I say he has nothing to work with: the character is just there to steer the boat and give Hurley backrubs.  He has no real personality quirks and Lucas works best when he plays someone who's a bit flawed (he is a rare case of a character actor who has leading-man good looks but bland roles don't suit him).  Sean Penn, on the other hand, looks like he's sleepwalking through half the movie.  His alcoholic poet seems more like he's stoned on Prozac; there's no passion, even when he quotes Dylan Thomas.  I think this was a miscasting; he's not sympathetic either.  (SPOILER ALERT: His character's fate during the storm is almost deserved; one cannot feel sympathy for him.)    The story set in the last century is much more interesting but because of the cut-up flashbacks, one doesn't hold interest.  Sarah Polley is a good actress, but her moping around -- "Oh, I'm stuck in a loveless marriage, and I really want to sleep with my brother again," attitude gets old.  Yes, dear viewers, I gave away another spoiler: incest. The other actors that play in the murder mystery story (aside from Polley and the great Ciaran Hinds as the wrongly accused murderer) are all Scandinavian and I've never heard of any of them before.  They do a good job with the material they're given, but it's hard to connect with them as well.   Perhaps this is one of those movies that you grow to like after repeated viewings.  Once was enough for me.  Perhaps you also need to read the original Anita Shreve novel before you watch it.  If so, I understand the movie is quite the literal adaptation.  This may be its biggest flaw: novels can be cinematic in their themes, imagery and their dialogue; they become water-logged when one tries to adapt the same style in telling two contrasting stories.  It also helps that when reading a novel with two story lines, it's much easier to go back and re-read parts of it, when the action gets confusing.   
 I'm a huge BC fan and I thought his first book was great, I actually laughed out loud multiple times while reading it (which looks kind of weird on an airplane). This one misses the mark completely. As a made up account of making a movie, it fails completely. The story and events are rediculously not plausible or funny. He should stick to non-fiction 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 I'm sorry, I just had to include that in the title of my review. Anyway. This book is...odd. That is the best one word to describe it. It is random, and the sentences, if you can call them that, seem to be strung together by a kindergartener. I like to compare this book to one throwing a bucket of paint against a wall and watching the droplets of liquid trickle down in odd patterns. It is not a BAD novel, per say. I can totally imagine this book being read in a dark room at a poetry slam, with a small crowd of twenty-somethings drinking and reminiscing about high school, a time which seems so far away to them. But if you are a teen reading this on a lazy day with nothing but a book to entertain, you could certainly do better. I wish i could explain the plot to you. I really do. But, alas, I can't. I can only grasp that it is centered around a high school writer named Zoe, with a penchant for homosexuals. It also includes a LOT of curse words, and strong subject matter. I would not read this if you are under 15 or are sensitive to these things.  The plot makes no sense, and it is written in a very odd form. The writing is clearly written by a teenager, and an extremely angsty, very probably self-centered one at that. This is a last-minute read, if you are desperate, or if for some odd reason you want to remember the days you cursed at your mother and questioned your sexuality. 
 Well in my opinion, there is no longer any doubt that some things appear to be flying in our skies, and some people have had some unusual experiences (mostly disturbing, but some apparrently enlightening), but the question is, is it all as it seems?  The fact of the matter is, various military branches from around the globe have real hardware that could easily fool us.  Holographic projections can and are used to place images within our skys (this is related to controversial theories surrounding the 911 events); there are devices that can manipulate brain waves and neuronal excitation to have people hallucinate any scenario; advanced, drug manipulated hypnotic techniques can control memories and behaviour; implants have been around for decades and have even gone mainstream now (Verichip).  I'm not saying that other lifeforms don't exist in the Universe (far from it), and perhaps there are a number of entities here on Earth carrying out agendas, but this idea that there are little, menacing Greys abducting us for various sinister reasons without immense COLLUSION seems suspect.  It smells of classic fear mongering that the elite love to push on us.  Historically, there's been the Barbarians, Huns, Mongols,  Pagans, Jews, Christians, Vikings, black Natives, Cannabals, red Natives, Mexicans, Germans, Nazis, Communists, now the Arabs and the next logical conclusion is some evil force off planet because they have used all the boogey men on Earth.  Even President Reagan set us up for this scenario in an infamous speech in the late 80's.  The fact is that with known technology (not including whatever they may have that has not been leaked), they could quite easily pull the hoax off.  Even genetic manipulation and cloning is much further advanced and PRACTICED (albeit "underground") than most people can fathom.  What has become another fact is the major extent to which the UFO community has been infiltrated and compromised, of which Strieber has been front and centre at various times.  My belief is that Strieber is part of this fear mongering campaign, sponsored by the elite and carried out by various military and government groups.  In this book, his "hard-evidence" is flimsey and suspicious.  For example, why wouldn't super advanced Aliens using implants design them such that they are entirely organic and of shapes that mimic human tissue (thus not showing up on any X-ray, MRI, CT, etc)?  And design them such that they quickly break down when removed from the body?  Surely, this would be child's play for Alien scientists?  Why no major discussion or mention of the human military, or NAZI connection with abductions?  There seems to be a growing number of victims who are recalling strange "fragments" of memories that are slipping through various memory covers.  Why are they mentioning cooperation of human doctors and nurses with the Greys?  Why are they mentioning swastikas and other known military insignias on uniforms?  Why are some speaking English, others German?  Why is there a connection with deep, underground bases and specifically Antartica?  These are things Strieber never mentions, which I find curious.  My point is, things are happening, but it has become nearly impossible to ascertain what, and Strieber's books seem to cloud the issues and possibly even advance certain agendas.       
 Read The Holy Quran before reading any propaganda books like this. Any book on Islam not written by a Islamic Scholar will be biased and racist. The wisdom of the Islamic Faith can only be understood by understanding the life of the Prophet Mohammed (PBUH). The Hadith will guide you in understanding the true path for all mankind. Please do not buy propaganda books. Go to the sourse of all Islamic thought. Read the Koran and the Hadith and understand the truth without lies from American Press 
 We bought this sweeper at Christmas over a year ago, IT has never started and they sent another one ofter several months and it did the same then we have never even had one that wil start once, and My poor mom who is 88 years old is very disappointed. they are hard to get parts out of it take months to get a part. I will never buy another one, If you get one that works it is great but getting that one that will work is almost impossible. 
 I pity those in strategic planning if this textbook is the best around.  I found it to be the most boring text I had ever read.  It was hard to get more than two pages read before snoozing.  I finally gave up and started reading the summaries, and then going back over the details if I had time.  In addition to the boredom, the political correctness had me groaning all the way through.  Exploration of Venus? - give me a break!  In spite of my disgust with the textbook, the workbook was actually useful.  It was to-the-point and much more understandable.  
 Making a homemade suppressor for anything larger than a .22 caliber weapon is foolhardy. I doubt the designs in this book would even be up to that task. The pressures exerted by modern guns is extreme and you risk serious injury trying to contain them with a "soda can  silencer". Oh, and I forgot to mention that making one of these will land you 10 years in federal prison every time 
 The book is good scholarship in that it presents a myriad of facts about a myriad of organizations and movements. However, it is also extremely bad scholarship in that the author is unable to make sense of his own research. The extensive facts become a cluttered maze, a complex puzzle the author is unable to fit together. The book is a good historical reference, but otherwise an a-theoretical work that offers little insight. The author would do well to reach out and read the work of others who apply a more analytical perspective to similar material. I am not trying to be insulting, but he seems to have no comprehension of the history he reports 
 "A masterpiece!" Maybe..For me, this is kind of film that makes me eternally boring mainly because it is so serious and so heavy. A good try for a film student with visual and musical sensitivity, but felt like a sociological treatise. Failed as a story.  
 Chris Van Alsberg's beloved Christmas classic is brought to the screen in this sickeningly self indulgent, outrageously overblown animated film. The characters are bland,and their movements are creepy and mechanical, both of which make them feel more like robots than humans. The film's biggest problem is that it dosen't seem to know whether to treat itself like a horror movie, a children's Christmas cartoon, or a slapstick comedy. The film overflows with half-baked ideas,for instance,there is a mysterious hobo-zombie who makes his home  on the train's roof and a room filled with abandoned toys. It is NOT an exaggeration to describe the film as creepy, as many other reviewers have. While not quite the ''cat''astrophe of the Seuess films,THE POLAR EXPRESS is still something of a train wreck.   SCORE:4/1 
 I had read glowing reviews of this book and expected more than I got when I read it myself.  Disappointment is often a function of expectations and reality being out of synch and I think that was the source for me here.  It's not that it's a bad book, but I didn't get the DEPTH of information I was expecting.  After going through the design and build process a couple of times, I felt as thought I already knew what was broadly covered in this book.    Also, I was disappointed in the photo layouts.  Like another reviewer here, I found the spaces to be pretty impractical for living in 
 Levitas' book is well written and documented but it doesn't contain much that is new.  I've been reading about the radical right for almost 20 years now and there were no surprises here, only a rewritten version of what is in about 20 other books and reports.  The subject has been exhausted and this book proves it 
 The content of this book is nothing short of a diaster! I had to read this book for my Ethics in the Information Age class here at the Rochester Institute of Technology and I must say that this is the worst textbook I ever had to read. It felt more like a highschool essay thats 155 pages long. The book is plagued with wordy sentences that can confused and bemuddle anyone who isn't an english major. Practically every sentence is littered with words that a bare few of us remember from the SATs (perhaps to lengthen the book?). The book's content doesn't provide a sense of contraversy about ethics in cyberspace. I beleive that he tried to stay neutral in the arguments but it only seemed to confuse me. The auther included a lot of references to other sources suggesting that he too doesn't even know a thing about Cyber Ethics, resorting to other people's works. The writng is too abstract and at most times I ended up rereading the book several times just to make sense of it. If I didn't need this for class, I recommend not buying this book. I am sure there are plenty of other well written Cyber Ethics books than this 
 A&E Biography has several episodes that deal with "B-list" famous people.  It's a bit harder to watch them than say works about Abe Lincoln, Gandhi, or Marie Antoinette.  Still, if you want to learn about the life of an incredibly rich and successful person, then here you go.  This man seemed like a pre-Donald Trump.  He looked far younger than he was, as did his sons, and he seemed to have worked long after most Americans have retired.  This work does not just talk about the positives.  One learns that he failed at many ventures before putting up his hotels.  He was divorced twice during an era when that was taboo.  I loved learning that, like Robert Redford and Billy Bean, he grew up around Latinos and was thus bilingual.  This documentary has a political edge as his hotel was taken over by Castro after he seized power in Cuba.  I am constantly lambasting "Biography" for watering down the progressive leanings of famous people.  However, here they show Mr. Hilton with Nixon and Ike but never once label him a Republican.  Maybe they avoid the right as well as the left.  FOR MODERN VIEWERS, PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS PARIS HILTON'S GREAT-GRANDFATHER.  This work was made in 1996, before she stuck her face, and other body parts, all over the media and specializing in being a hot mess.  On the one hand, her great-grandfather advocated prayer and was a dedicated Catholic, but on the other, he liked to be seen with beautiful ladies.  So it is unclear what he would have thought about Paris and her shenanigans.  Further, he had a son who lived the fast life before he prematurely died.  Paris' grandfather is interviewed, but he just praises his father, rather than speaking of himself or his progeny 
 It is bad enough that this is a poor book with no balance, but to require it as a text in post-graduate studies in education almost brings on apoplexy.  It is a secular humanist apoligia for multiculturalism in education.  It is singular in point of view, never straying from the thesis that multiculturalism is good and schools must support it; hardly the sort of reference work for a university level discussion of the issues.  The philosophy behind the book is that people are hardly more or less than those cultural elements which have been socialized into them with little responsibility for their beliefs or actions.  The main text is that every culture is equally valuable in society, forgetting that "society" is essentially American culture with its own priorities.  They go into great detail on the virtues of immigrant cultures and the vices of the American culture, hardly accepting that it has a right to exist as well.  The most difficult aspect of this is the authors' almost laughable inability to get outside of their point of view and treat the issues with something approaching objectivity.  The book is unbearable in its "holier than thou" attitude.  I don't know if this is typical of the ilk but if so, it is hardly a wonder that the multicultural mavens have difficulty selling their point of vie 
 I REALLY,REALLY HATE FOREIGNER AND I RANK THEM AS BAD AS GREEN DAY.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS DISGUSTINGLY AWFUL CD WHICH CONTAINS TRASH LIKE WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU WHICH HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST MORONIC AND STUPID SONGS EVER.GET ANY LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM INSTEAD 
 I returned this phone after one week. Currntly the Motoral software has a glitch and you can't assign specifice ring tones to phone number. Ear piecs sound quality is marginal. text messaging is difficult becaust the keys are hard to see and too small. The back panel display is too small and hard to read. 
 Pygmalion centers on a woman who cannot speak to save her life. She is the most interesting of the three main characters but also the worst to focus on. She is boring to the point of tears. She is poor, hungry, and happy. It is a typical underdog story where two rich and powerful men who happen to be specialists in her area of need -language-happen upon her in a gloomy British rain. Surprised? I was not. Shaw cut right to the point; after all, it is a short play. I do not blame Shaw for making it short, more of Higgins and I would have put the play down.  Should we try to pinpoint why the two men, more so Higgins, decide to tutor and to change Eliza, we come across purely selfish motives. Eliza sells flowers on the street in order to feed herself, and later goes to Higgins to learn proper English in order to become a shop-owner. Higgins wants to change her into a proper girl in order to prove that he is the greatest linguistics tutor, also, to win a bet...how egocentric. Selfish acts drive this play along. Here, the class struggle also comes into play as Eliza must not only refrain from using the only language she knows, but must change the way in which she holds herself in front of society. Shaw wrote Eliza's character very precisely to have individual dignity and determination to help her achieve her goals. The one thing I liked.  The play is about adaptation and transformation. Eliza's incredible strength moves the play along more quickly despite Higgins' pompous attitude slowing it down. Then again, without the diametrically opposed characters the play would not work.   Interesting class struggle and realistic language effort but overall, just a so-so read. Shaw has a good point: it takes effort to move up to bourgeoisie. He has all the right characters: a poor, pretty girl with a desire to learn, a snotty old Professor who is full of himself and a rich gentleman to provide the budget. Unfortunately, and perhaps due to the year I was born, the generation I grew up in and my penchant for sex and scandal, I found it rather dry. I am glad I read it, but will likely not pick it up again.  
 Keeps the drinks chilled but not cold What do you expect for $20bucks Would no buy again. Would go for the more traditional fridges 
 Save your money.  It's mostly about MFC and there are much, much better books out there about MFC.  The references to the .NET platform are too casual to be of much value 
 I like Cory Doctorow's writing style and have been a fan since reading 'In the Shadow of the Mothaship'. I was glad to find this  compilation so I did not have to hunt down old SciFi magazines.   The stories are almost all near future settings that have an element of the fantastic but not scientific, with the exception of the story '0wnz0red' which is the book's capstone piece. Doctorow writes in fast, hip, word-mashing style that others have copied, but at which he excels. Subjects usually revolve around a theme of youthful rebellion and, the young characters while very involved in their own world, tend to dismiss or miss larger issues. This is fine but he never examines it in any detail. All the characters are young or young minded and seem to be in on the joke. It is hard to had empathy with these characters.  Each story is preceded by author notes. The information given is historical, humorous, or biographical. And he talks about issues important to him such electronic rights and 'sampling'.  Some of these subjects need more than just a paragraph. On the issue of  sampling he asserts that writers should be able to 'lift' pieces of other authors stories; backdrops, character sketches et cetera. Other authors simply claim to have been inspired by books they have read, Doctorow takes this idea a step further.  In 'A place so foreign'  he admits to having read Fitzgerald's 'The Great Brain' children's books and copies the entire setting of Mormon Utah in the 1860s.  Also in 'The Superman and the Bugout' he copies the comic hero Superman; right down to the tights, trunks and cape. These stories are yawnfests. When he uses his own ideas the stories are MUCH better, memorable even. '0wnz0red' is a great story about  programming,  bio-technology, and pushing the limits of human physiology, the characters and tension are believable.   Doctorow sells himself, and the reader, short by not examining the ideas in each story. He certainly has the talent to do so, but never closes the deal. Only two selections can be considered complete short stores. The rest are slice-of-life, literary snapshots, that are amusing in their telling but lack a equally weighty denouement. I look forward to what he may write the year he turns forty 
 I wish I would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item!  These are flimsy, thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter.  I'm definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad.  Fortunately there are other products that work better...if this was the only option, I might as well not have a sheet on at all. 
 Glass has some good suggestions on how to rebuild your marriage after an affair,  however she made some very troubling comments in regards to affairs with ex's and/or "Old Flames".  Some of the comments almost seem to encourage affairs with Ex's.  Her are a few examples: 1) Page 34 - If the old flames reconnection results in marriage these unions are highly SUCCESSFUL?  How can she describe an adulterous affair that destroys a marriage and family SUCCESSFUL? 72% of rekindled romances stay together.  If they were 1st loves, the stay-together rate is 78%.   2) Page 130 - "There is a 60 % divorce rate in 2nd marriages...unless you are marrying an old flame from your youth.  The chapter notes state that the old flame marriages had a 72% stay together rate. Chapter 15 talks about giving up and the steps to take to have a smooth divorce. Not a good chapter to read if you are trying to save your marriage. 
 We were excited for the first bunch of stickers and then my 5 year old wanted to try it himself.  It jammed up and that was the end of it.  There are no instructions on how to fix it so I threw the cartridge away.  Don't waste your money 
 This movie is not funny it is not scary just plain stupid do not let these other reviews fool you believe me you are going to hate yourself  for buying this movie 
 First off, when I recieved the book there was a cigarette hole burned on one of the pages. (Nice one!) Right out of the package.  Then when I opened it, I realized that all the claims that the book is based around are pretty far fetched and really cannot be substantiated.  Every time the Bible used the words like: Evil Ones, Sinner, Wicked, etc. aren't really talking about people, but fallen angels....ummm...what?!    Supposedly John the Baptist refuted these angels in the gospels by saying, "You brood of Vipers!"  Umm...it doesn't take a rocket scientist to prove that in the sentence before (or the current one) says that he's talking with the Pharisees and Saduccees.  The Bible is very clear on that point and I'm not sure what the writer was thinking.    Too much conjecture, and false analogies in my opinion.  I'm really sorry I bought this book.  I wished whoever burned the one page burned the rest of it too 
 The authors make several references to a set of plans and list of materials that are included with this book but these appear to be missing. I would not try to build a masonry oven with this book but it is a good start 
 With the X-Men feature films and the hit Ultimate X-Men comic opening the world of X-Men to new fans, X-Men: Evolution takes the established characters fans have loved for years (Cyclops, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Rogue, Shadowcat) and puts them as high school students living at Professor Xavier's mansion with Wolverine and Storm as grown up instructors, and a new character named Spyke is introduced as well (whose powers are distinctly similar to that of Marrow, a former X-Men member in the comics).  Many longtime fans didn't find the series too likeable because of the way it is presented, and X-Men: Evolution doesn't hold a candle to the early 90's Fox show.  Nightcrawler's characterization is terrible, and there's too much teenie bopper type mellow drama going on with high school kids.  The animation is decent, but it's not as gritty as the Fox series.  The later seasons however, in which beloved characters Gambit and Colossus are introduced (and they do battle with Apocalypse), are much better than the episodes contained on these discs, but all in all I'd stick with the Fox series anyday 
 Don't waste your time reading this book - this book is awful! This book was supposed to be so good, according to the other reviews, and it's definitely not a good novel. In fact, this is by far the worst novel I have read in my life. I think one of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head - must of this book just seems like random writing and ultimately it has no real purpose for carrying forward the plot line. Indeed, it definitely seems like he was just trying to meet a word count for the publisher. The edition of the book I read was slightly over 700 pages, and it could have easily been reduced to 300 without affecting in any way the plot line. Thus the reader is left to swallow 400 pages of pointless writing that just seems like "waffling" to mention the term used in England to describe writing that leads you no where. Not only that, but the 300 pages devoted to actually explaining the plot are not that interesting anyway. The plot line of the novel is incredibly implausible; a prince who is an "idiot" but on occasions doesn't seem like such an idiot after all and who suffers from a mysterious illness of "idiocy" that could not be labelled as an actual illness by modern medicine. Moreover, one of the principal characters in the novel, Aglaia Yepanchin supposedly is madly in love with the prince while at the same time making fun of him in a very rude way right in front of his nose - am I the only one here who thinks this is JUST a little implausible? And then just to make matters worse, and as an appetizer after having to swallow 650 pages of horrible writing, near the end of the novel Dostoyevski puts in the mouth of the prince two full pages of the most outrageous slander against the Catholic religion I have read in my life. Supposedly, according to Dosteyvski, atheism comes from the Catholic religion - certainly Dosteyevski doesn't hide his hatred for the Catholic faith. Even atheists would laugh at such an absurd proposition 
 my other management textbooks were able to cover nearly the same amount of information in 1/4 the space without being needlessly complex or as paralizingly boring. it would be an excellent cure for insomnia. professors PLEASE don't make anyone buy this thing. 
 I loved this smoker the first two times I used it but after the third it stopped working as well and by the fifth it didn't work at all.  After examining all the parts, I noticed that the thermostat had burned up around the contact points.  It was under warranty so they sent me a new thermostat but I was forced to pay the shipping!  I used it once and examined the new thermostat and it had already started to burn around one contact point after just one use.  I think I'll go back to my charcoal grill 
 I purchased the ab lounge 2 online, but returned it the same day.  It's too bulky & heavy.  I wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news, but it's too heavy to move around, and it DOES NOT FOLD.   I put it together in my living room, and then tried to get it into my bedroom BUT IT WOULDN'T FIT THROUGH THE DOOR.  I had to un-screw the bars, fold & pull it through the door.  If I had put the AB Lounge 2 downstairs, then I would never use it.  Unless you want the "AB LOUNGE 2" to be a "PERMANENT" fixture in your bedroom or living room, then I would order something else.  I need this thing to be where I can easily use it & then put it away.......The Ab Lounge 2 is way too big & bulky for that.  Unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture, then don't buy it.  I'm buying the "Ultra" Ab Lounge because it folds for easy storage....It's more expensive, but to me it's worth the convenience of having the "EASY" storage capability.  I don't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it's not in use. 
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 Shawn reveals (indirectly) that he is a disloyal Catholic. Now before you rate this review as unhelpful I'll explain why that is relevant: It shows he is a hypocrite and that his book is therefore hypocritical. Now although a hypocrite can get things right, when it comes to morality they usually get things wrong, which Shawn certainly did do in his teachings in this book. For example:  He promotes (and worships) democracy and "liberty" over God. I'm sure some of you Catholics will be like "what? He advocates the Bible in school and school prayer" but that doesn't mean he is advocating it for the right reasons, just as the Pharisees didn't advocate religion and the Old Testament for, ultimately, the right reasons. Now perhaps some of you will think, "Well who cares as long as he is advocating what is right, who cares about his motives." Well he says what his motives are and they go contrary to the Bible, so in the end he is promoting something which is just as self-defeating as liberalism, etc.. He reveals in his book that his motives are to maintain the (publically known) Republican agenda (plus getting the bible and prayer in public schools, etc.), promoting and upholding democracy throughout the world, and indirectly promotes the whitewashed historical teachings and books in public schools (although I'm sure he wouldn't if he really knew more accurately the history of the U.S.)  So, what's wrong with promoting liberty, democracy, and the white wash in schools? Obviously no one wants white wash and most American's know the usual history text books in school are something the inquisitions might have had success using, so I'll move on to liberty and democracy. Liberty in Shawn's eyes INCLUDES the right to promote Catholocism and not just the  traditional religions. For us who are saved and many atheists know that the Catholic religion is a cult, and promoting it is treason (among other things) in our eyes. Now for democracy. The U.S. has a rigged democracy, and it is really an Aristocratic Democracy, everyone knows that, even Shawn, it just slips his mind because he lets himself get majorly distracted.  As an example of Shawn's ignorance of the more complicated parts of U.S. history, and his gullibility, he says in his book that F.D.R. was a democratic leader. Yet many teens in high school know that isn't true having heard his "New Deal". Even wiki acknowledges that that was communistic. He also perpetuates the myth that Islamic terrorists were responsible for twin tower DEMOLITION. Anyone with the net and who knows to double check facts, and who knows the evil side of America's history knows what I mean by "demolition" in reference to 9/11.  He also perpetuates this illogical goal: unity (under democracy) for the sake of it (like just supporting Bush, Jr. regardless of what he says). He doesn't say it but implies it. Unity for the sake of allowing Bush Jr. and the troops in Iraq to have a nice day is stupidity.  And check out this self-centered attitude: "some sick cell of terrorists just attacked my world." Well what happened to the people they attacked, their world, the one that ended that day?  He also picks on Clinton for reasons you can probably guess, as if he was the ONLY bad president. This book is childish, and I don't mean that in a mean way, I mean it's as if it were written by an angry, poorly educated, arrogant preteen who had a good editor.  One thing he does imply, and rightly so, is that the "Koran" is evil. But, big surprise, didn't come out and say that outright, I WONDER WHY?! So much for courage 
 The begining of this book has lots of useful information including digging and diving for bottles. However, I was disappointed with the amount of pictures. The descriptions for most bottles were vague. I rated it a 2 because of the extensive listing of Jim Beam bottles. If you collect Jim Beam this would be a worthwhile book 
 Renny Reynolds is a talented designer.  I own his first book published in 1992 by Viking Studio Books entitled "The Art of the Party, Design Ideas for Succesful Entertaining".  While browsing through Amazon, I discovered a more recent book by Mr. Reynolds published in March 2003 by Gibbs Smith in Salt Lake City.  Although the name was similar, the publisher and publication date as listed were different. Upon receiving the "new" book, I was surprised to find the EXACT same book published in 1992 with a new book jacket and fly pages.  What a disappointment.  The pictures and ideas are dated; if you want up to the minute new ideas, do not order this book.  I attended parties in the 90's that used these very themes.  Why order the new book when you can have the old one with dated ideas much cheaper.  
 Clint Black greatest hits ? Not much to write home about, sorry to say. It`s realy a downfall his version of the Eagles master peace Desperado. Sometimes everything goes wrong here, especially his voice. But anyway let`s take a look at the bright side on this album. The best songs are Track 15 No Time to Kill, which have a certain sting to it when it comes to  singing capacity and country flavour. Track 14 Life gets away  also is a good listen, an has hit poential. It sounds like belive it not like the The Cure crossover with country music. Track 11 Cadilack Jack Favor also have some charm. Track 8 We tell Ourselves swings a little bit too. Track 6 A better man has quality and "swing along". Track 2 Summers Commin kick a little , but the rest of the tracks don`t make me feel "country halleluja", sorry to say. Clint Black is not up there with Alan Jackson and Garth Brooks 
 Don't get me wrong.  The book was relatively easy to read.  BUT ALFIE HAS NO CREDENTIALS IN THIS FIELD!  He has never been a teacher.  He has no educational certification.  He's an arm-chair general telling you what he thinks is wrong with education, and there's plenty wrong.  Unfortunately, without that background in the field, his arguments and positions are extreme.  It's an unreasoned "throw the baby out" approach similar to his anti-testing rhetoric that complains, but does not suggest viable, reasoned alternatives.  I know where the holes are -- the dam in full of them.  Give me reasoned solutions please!  If that's what you're looking for, don't buy this book or any of Alfie's material 
 The movie has many none-too-subtle *VERY* anti-Christian elements, particularly in the typical Hollywierd portrayal of money grubbing "Christian" TV Evangelists and Christians themselves as stupid zombies; life as basically pointless.  I am sick of Hollywood rubbish like this! So, if you're a Christian, stand firm -- DON'T BUY IT!! 
 I used this book for the Cornell Econ 301 course, a calculus based intro to microeconomics. The professor taught everything in lecture so that the book was used only as a supplement. I read part of the book and found that it is too verbose and repetitive. The author could have explained everything in less than half of the book. The exercises are not helpful. Moreover, this little book is sold for more than a 100 dollars. Not worth the money at all. 
 This book begins with the absurd claim that 'the natural numbers -1, 2,3, 4 etc- appear to have been present at the birth of the universe; part and parcel of the original material from which was knit the ever-expanding continuum of space-time.' The author does not explain in whose mind these numbers are supposed to have appeared or how a concept can be present without a mind to concieve it. Like many mathematicians he seems unable to grasp that mathematics is a language. Thus it's not uncommon to hear ridiculous statements like 'the universe is governed by mathematics' As if numbers exert forces. But this is the first time I've encountered the claim that numbers existed prior to life!   
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 In response to the overwhelming academic reaction to his first essay "The American Civil Religion," Robert Bellah again addresses the creation, development, and subsequent destruction of "the covenant" manifested in the American Civil Religion in his book, The Broken Covenant.  By enumerating and expounding upon the "myths" of the American Civil Religion, Bellah attempts to uncover the American self-understanding that has both created and corrupted the Covenant. The myth of origin reveals the basic self-conceptualization of America: a pristine wilderness, a place of new beginnings for "the chosen" who reform the old covenant.  According to Bellah, from a biblical as well as classical republican perspective, America is a land of living myth with a covenant based on Calvinist teachings of common charity, love, individual dignity, and responsibility through which the internal spiritual covenant meshes with the external political covenant to create public virtue. He believes that the American "covenant" legitimizes and gives purpose to the American identity. He compares his book to the lamentations of a prophet crying out in the wilderness, trying to alert the population to societal corruption and impending doom while maintaining a hope for the future upon repentance. He argues that utilitarianism, capitalism and science, along with the "sins" of slavery and the treatment of the Native Americans, have corrupted and destroyed this covenant, leaving America empty of purpose. In violation of the covenant, capitalistic self-interest motivated American society instead of republican virtue.  His solution espouses the creation of a new covenant that humbly recognizes the past and present flaws of America, renews the traditions of the old covenant and provides moral and spiritual meaning for the technological and scientific dimensions of modern society.   Using mostly primary sources, armed with a sociologist's understanding of American history and fueled by personal experience, Bellah attempts to evaluate the American Civil Religion in the past, present, and future.  Though he realizes the current problem regarding the corrupted ideals of republicanism, equality, spirituality and religion, his ideas for the resurgence of the American Civil Religion are vague and abstract. He proposes a state of constant revolution, a continuous renewal of covenant through religious and spiritual rebirth that will fill the external political covenant of America with meaning.  Along with the restitution of the inward covenant, Robert Bellah kowtows to the popular theories of the early 1970s, such as communitarianism and socialist policies, which have failed thus far in America.   Rather than a transcendent new order, he espouses the call for reform common to the generation disillusioned by the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal; his book appears to be the result of a personal attempt to find meaning in a changing modern society.  
 I did not like this book very much. The author treats her subjects as if they were some sort of cockroach species under her idealistic American microscope.  It is more accurate to say that this book is an account of how expatriates "survive" in KSA and not a true representation of the nation or its people. It is full of supercilious generalizations and patronizing commentary. It fully conforms to the biased view of Muslim nations presented in the Western media.  I know many Saudis and they are nothing like the examples presented in this book. To the contrary, they are some of the most hospitable and genuine people I have come accross.  If you want the "Fox News" version of Saudi, by all means read this book 
 Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, by Mildred Taylor was a very disappointing book. There is no particular story; the book starts rising action here and there and down again here and there. There is no specific climax. Basically, it's like there's no story. What I also hated about this book was the ending and the fact that there was no moral in the story. The book was full of cliches from every chaper by chaper. Each chapter was too long( this is not a dumb complaint). Instead of just starting a new chapter, Taylor just skips a line to basically start a new chapter. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense to you.   Like any novels that have to do with early 40-50s racism, in my opinion, there should ALWAYS be a moral,  stating that racism is wrong and people could just get along regardless of their skin color. This book had no moral. The ending was an ending wrapping up what was only a minor part of the story. I see a lot of positive reviews around here so maybe I am the only one who dislikes the book. But regardless of the reviews, I highly DONT recommend this book to any reader. 
 Half-hearted adaptation of Ernest Haycox novel is weak.  Scott is good as Owen; Knox is equally good as the baddie, but the film is missing movement.  If there were ever a Razzie award at the time, it would have to go to the  title song 
 I thought the book was exceptionally short for a body of work lasting 45 years. Great pictures though.   I had some major problems with the writing itself. It's like 45 years went by in a blur and he was an observer and not a participant.   He didn't seem to take much interest in his bandmates, there's very little known about Eddie, Paul, David and Melvin. For a man with the inside track, very little is revealed. The book seems to be more about him and not the Temptations.  He seemed also to forget certain facts, like, David was indeed married when he started seeing Tammi Terrell. When she announced that she and David were engaged back in the early sixties, is when she found out David was already married and couldn't marry her. (This also around the time her headaches started.) I don't what the relationship between Geena and Otis is/was, but for him to leave her and Davids' son out of the book was wrong, totally wrong. He acknowledged the others' wives, why not Geena?  Another thing that disturbed me was Otis' "my way or the highway" attitude toward his group members. Truly adolescent behavior. When he wasn't scouting out women, he was scouting out new talent. (But I guess in his mind it's the same thing). ,"just in case so and so doesn't work out", seems to me, he was waiting on the inevitable. He comes off as arrogant and overbearing. "No one man's bigger than the group." Like Eddie said in the movie, "Who is the group for, who did "it" make sacrifies for?"  OTIS, knows good and well, that he and Melvin could not have carried the group on their own. Eddie, Paul, and David didn't need "the group", as much as "the group" needed them. David and Eddie saw the writing on the wall between Barry and Otis, well before hand and did the smart thing and got out. I wish Paul had as well, alive. Otis should have thought more of his "brothers" and fought for them. He waited too long. Too bad he used the book to trash them when they're not here to defend themselves.  With  three ex-wives and 15 ex-Temps on the roster, maybe it would do Otis good to look inside himself and not place blame everywhere or to everyone.    Paul and Eddie brought style and sophistication and experience. As well as their voices. David, brought the fire and raw sex appeal they needed. And last, but not least, Melvin, with that bottom drawer, under the floor bass. There's no one else like him. Have to give Dennis his "props" too. He may not be an original Temp, but because of him, they got their first of many Grammys to come.   Otis should be more greatful, he and Eddie forged a supergroup we'll never see again. He's not one-fifth as talented as his current or original band-mates. If he could sing, we'd know about it. He's a man that needed a group and he got one. Each man brought with him his own set of baggage, but they were the best.  They will be missed through out time.   Thanks for the music, guys, Where ever you are, (we know you're together) take a bow. We love you 
 I love romantic comedies and both of these actors, but this movie was not good.  I gave it two stars because it was below average.  I watched the whole thing, hoping for it to get better, but it didn't.  Then I tried to watch the commentary, thinking that at least hearing the making of the movie should be interesting.  Wrong.  I couldn't make myself watch more than 10-15 minutes of it.  The only person on the commentary was Debra Messing--not even the director or the producer--and she had no idea about why things were the way they were.  The only things she could comment on were scenes she was in and she didn't have a lot to say.  There were several minutes of complete silence.  I think it should have been called 'watch the movie with Debra Messing'.  And, like I said, I like her, but this movie was pretty poor.  She referred to the movie's low budget several times, saying they didn't have time to do any more than X takes of a scene, so maybe that explains it.  
 I bought the audio book and started listening on an 18 hour plane trip to India.  I only made it through 4 chapters.  Maybe the book is easier to take, but the narrative style of the author on the audio book made me feel like I was in grade-school again.  On top of that, the premise of the book was too simplistic.  Fix yourself, get happy, clean your emotional house...  I'm not saying the material won't enlighten anyone, but if you're awake at all, you probaly have heard what she has to say already -- and probably from someone less annoying 
 This book is improperly titled. It should not be called "The Making of the Beatles' White Album"; instead, it should be called "A Tribute to Paul McCartney". Quantick constantly shows his love for Paul McCartney throughout this book. He actually says, "The world knew Paul McCartney was the greatest songwriter who'd ever lived", a claim that could be hotly debated. He also calls him "the band's greatest rocker", "the band's greatest balladeer" and "the band's greatest singer". He says that Ringo Starr was "absent in a huff" from the recording of "Back in the USSR"; he claims that George Harrison was the reason that Manson committed his murders; he butchers John Lennon a few times. Yes, he does say he likes Yoko and her work, but mostly he talks about Paul McCartney. Paul himself could have authorized this book, because 95% of the stuff in here about him is glowing 
 With the all star lineup this movie had, I would've thought that they could be better utilized than a story on the Gov. of Lousiana. This could have been a really good gangster flick - all the people were avaialable. Sean Penn instead of all his hand waving and droning on and on about something I really could not follow, could have put his skills onto something better. This movie is a complete waste of talent, money - you name it 
 Mr. O'Nan should have taken a refresher course in basic writing.  His skipping and skimming and throwing to and fro people, events, etc., is downright frustrating and confuses the project.  Unlike superior literary treatments (see Walter Lord's TITANIC), this book leave you with more questions than anything else and the urge to take a long, hot shower.  
 Rechargeable flashlights are a sensational idea - an essential part of any family's emergency kit (and ecologically smart to boot). While this product is satisfactory for, say, a science demonsration on the Faraday Principle, its usefulness as a flashlight is considerably more limited.   To its credit: This flashlight was meant to last, and will stand extremes of water and temperature. When dropped into water, it will float beam-side up for easy retrieval. It's so sturdy tha, it will likely last for the lifetime of the user - and you can't say that about too many products.   Shake this light for a while, and a disk of rare earth conducts enough current to sustain a light for a small amount of time. While you may read claims of up to one or two hours, a faint but workable current only lasts for about ten minutes, and then you shake again. And again. As long as you don't mind the repetition, the wan stream of bluish light will serve your purposes in a blackout or some other emergency. But don't entertain thoughts that you'll be able to read, find small objects, or perform any kind of detail work.  If you don't have a chance to compare this to its better competition, you might not know that say, the Sherpa Xray offers a well-focused beam you can read by. While no rechargeable can give you the kind of illumination you'll find in a traditional flashlight, your options are brighter if you stay away from the Diamond Gen. Invest in something more powerful and you'll find that a flashlight's usefulness becomes considerably greater.   This flashlight was disappointing, and useless in any practical context 
 I am a big fan of Kathy Smith but this video is quite outdated -- I don't know the date but guessing late '80s.  The workout is fine but wish I bought something more up to date since so much about pregnancy fitness has changed in the last 10 years.  In the middle of the workout, there is an unnecessary pause where Kathy and the others in the video stop to perform a rap song...awfully silly and waste of precious time! 
 So I saw this one live action Alice in Wonderland movie and it sucked!!!! But I'm confused this isn't the same girl in that movie so this another live action movie, I think it is. I'm not sure if I want to risk boring myself with other crap... so will I watch this verison ever... who knows 
 ....But there wasn't anything for Oswald to talk about (conspiracy-wise, that is).  This 454-page publication, "Oswald Talked", claims that JFK's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, said something incriminating while in custody in Dallas, Texas, that proves he was part of some large, elaborate 'plot' to kill President Kennedy in 1963. Per this book's account, a cellmate of Oswald's in the Dallas jail overheard Oswald talking about "Jack Ruby" (and some other suspicious-sounding matters) that led to the ultimate title of this volume -- "Oswald Talked".  But haven't the many conspiracy theorists, who have for decades believed Oswald to be "Not Guilty" of the two murders he was accused of committing in 1963, ever wondered WHY Lee Harvey Oswald didn't "use" the MEDIA to his full advantage after being arrested and charged with two killings (JFK's and policeman J.D. Tippit's) IF Mr. Oswald WAS, in fact, what he claimed to be, "just a patsy"?  In other words, WHY (in such a "conspiracy"-related scenario which has Oswald TOTALLY INNOCENT of killing anyone on 11/22/63) does Oswald fail to shout at the top of his lungs ANY information about ANYTHING he knows regarding the "Patsy" plot to the many Live TV cameras that were staring him in the face on several occasions prior to Oswald's own untimely death at the hands of Jack Ruby two days later?  Such dead silence on the part of the "Patsy" makes little to no sense, IMO. Plus: Oswald's unemotional and relatively-calm demeanor following his arrest is NOT indicative of his being what he claimed to be -- a "Patsy".  Also keep in mind the fact that those many Live television cameras would have provided Mr. Oswald (the supposed 'Patsy') an ideal opportunity to spill his guts to the world, which would have included spilling any details to every other law-enforcement official and private investigator in the country (seeing as how virtually everybody in the USA was glued to their televisions for four days following the assassination).  A plot-spilling TV statement from the lips of Oswald during those two days of detention in Dallas would have CERTAINLY sparked (at the least) SOME type of private investigation and inquiry initiated by SOME crackerjack, on-his-toes P.I. somewhere in this country (or initiated by some crackpot -- err, uh, I meant "crackerjack" {sorry} -- District Attorney named Garrison in New Orleans perhaps). In such a case, Mr. Garrison could have started his Clay Shaw investigation several years sooner than he ultimately did.  Also.........  Lee Oswald's "Patsy" comment has not only been misunderstood and taken out of context (IMO), based on WHEN exactly he said it (which was immediately after a KNOWN and provable lie escaped Oswald's lips about being "taken in because of the fact I lived in the Soviet Union", meaning here that Oswald seems to be pointing the "framing" finger at the Dallas Police and NOT any conspirators behind-the-scenes who have just "set him up" for taking the full rap in the JFK murder).....  ..... But Oswald's single "I'm Just A Patsy!" comment just isn't nearly enough, IMO -- IF he was TRULY a "Patsy" as he shouted.  What I mean by that is ---  Just put yourself in Oswald's shoes for a moment (from a "CTer's" POV, that is) .... It's November 22, 1963; you've just been arrested and are about to be charged with TWO murders that you never committed; you KNOW (now) that there's a "plot" brewing to frame YOU, and SET YOU UP as the fall guy, i.e. the "Patsy" in this Presidential murder case.   And: You might also suspect that the police and/or FBI are also "in" on the plot to make you take the fall as the lone "Patsy", which would therefore mean that any "beans" you might spill behind closed doors while being interrogated would be swept under the rug if you were to implicate anyone ELSE in the "plot". .....  So, given the above knowledge you possess -- meager though it may be (or perhaps not so meager) regarding the "Who" and "Why" info of those people that are responsible for making you a "Patsy" -- do you now just simply CLAM UP in front of the LIVE television cameras, when you COULD very well be shouting to the world -- "Bannister and Ferrie and Shaw! They set me up! Go get those SOBs! I'm not taking this rap all by myself!!"  Would YOU, in a similar situation (where you KNOW you're being "set up" by SOMEBODY), just say "I'm just a patsy" one time and never take it any further?  If YOU had just been charged with TWO murders, including the killing of the President, and you didn't commit EITHER of these murders -- how could anybody or anything keep you from shouting at the top of your voice ANY details you might have about the "Who", "Where", and "Why" of the "Patsy Plot"?  And you've got ample opportunity throughout the weekend (on both November 22nd and November 23rd) to shout to EVERYONE IN THE WORLD any details you might possess of this "plot" that you seem to KNOW exists by shouting your single four-word declaration "I'm just a patsy".  I don't know about you, but if I had been "framed" for two murders I never committed, I think I'd be a TAD more ticked-off by the whole situation than Lee Harvey Oswald seemed to be during his two-day detention.  If truly innocent of these serious charges, Oswald would have been talking like mad to the Live TV cameras and microphones being shoved in his face every time he stepped into a DPD corridor, spilling more beans than the cops could probably have kept up with. And there's nothing the cops could have done in such a "Live TV" situation to shut him up (short of keeping the press at bay, which, of course, in hindsight, most certainly SHOULD have been done).  But, instead, Oswald seemed calm, cool, and collected virtually the entire time when facing the Live TV cameras. During the famous "Midnight Press Conference", does Oswald seem ticked-off or irritated at all? ... No.   Does he scream from the rooftops (during that PERFECT opportunity to do so) -- "I'm being framed here, people! Listen to me! Go get Clay Shaw and those other lowlifes who set me up in New Orleans!!"? ... No, he doesn't.  My question -- Why didn't he (if he's completely innocent and only the "Patsy" he claims to have been)?*  * = I'll answer my own inquiry --- The reason Oswald didn't "talk" about the details of any assassination "plot" after he was arrested is because there was no "plot" (other than Lee Harvey Oswald's "One-Man Plot" that he, himself, concocted in the days leading up to the assassination). In short, he didn't "talk" because Oswald -- alone -- was guilty as charged of two murders on November 22, 1963 
 This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who.  Unfortunately, they give away plot developments not only for this book but also for sequels in the Palliser Novels, of which Can You Forgive Her? is the predecessor to this work.  This seems altogether unforgivable, so I recommend you seek out another edition.  The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen.. 
 THIS BOOK IS REALY VERY POOR, I DID NOT GET NOTHING FROM IT.THERE ARE A LOT OF GOOD ONES SUCH AUTHORS AS ALBERT ELLIS,BACK,ROY HUNTER 
 Why is it ever time you want something bad enough it usually turns out bad? After the wonderful Quinn trilogy fans (including me) begged and begged for Nora Roberts to write Seth's story. After all we journeyed with Seth through we wanted to see him fall in love. Nora Roberts repeatedly said she would not write one. But us fans kept on begging for it and were excited when she finally gave in and wrote it. And we got Chesapeake Blue. Reading it you know you should be grateful because you wanted Seth's story but....this wasn't what I (and my fellow NR fans friends) wanted. First of all I wanted the heroine to be Aubrey. After their beautiful friendship in the Quinn trilogy I expected her to be Seth's love interest. But I tried to keep an open mind after all I loved Anna, Grace, and Sybill, but Dru Whitcomb Banks was a completely let down. All she did was whine and complain about her life which were minor compared to what Cam, Ethan, Philip, and Seth experienced as children. Seth becoming an artist was a surprise too I expected him to join the family business and design boats. The Gloria blackmailing him was a very thin and bad plotline. There's no reason Gloria would want to contact him considering all the warrents for her and that Seth wouldn't tell his family considering the Quinn Brothers (and wives)worked their so hard to keep him away from her. I closed this book vowing never to request, beg or petition an author to write a book when they say they don't want to. Because this is what you get 
 We've had Maisy's Christmas at my house for a couple of years and read it all year long.   When one of our friend's named her first daughter Maisy, (and knowing the mom as well as we do) Maisy Goes Shopping was a no-brainer.  Unfortunately, it's about the Grocery Store, not Maisy at Macy's (or the like).  Just helping you manage your expectations. ~Do 
 "Point of No Return" is fantastic, "I Can't Wait" a little less so. Whatever happened to this band?   The two tracks above are worth the modest purchase price 
 I found this software very difficult to use.  It does not have any "Stop" or "Go Back" button.  The only way to exit an activity is to hit "Esc" button to exit the program and then start all over.  When starting over, there is a very lengthy annimated introduction you have to go over each time and I could not find a way to skip it 
  These words are spoken by a fox, one of the villains of this book, to a talking bone, one of the heroes. The bone is not inanimate - it is a sentient creature with feelings and a sweet disposition.  There is no doubt that Steig is brilliant, but in The Amazing Bone he seems to have lost his bearings. How can a book purportedly written for children include a character that takes pleasure from inflicting pain, and describes it in this graphic way?  The fox also menaces Pearl, a darling piglet who is the other protagonist of the book. Her trouble starts, as it might for any child, as follows: "It was a brilliant day, and instead of going straight home from school, Pearl dawdled".  As she slowly makes her way home through idyllic scenery, Pearl happens upon the talking bone. "'May I take you home with me, wonderful bone?' Pearl asked".  But the happy scene is soon interrupted by three masked robbers who put a gun to the head of the innocent child. With the help of the bone Pearl escapes, only to fall into the clutches of the even more sinister fox. The shocking threat of torture follows as the valiant bone tries to rescue its new friend for a second time.  "When they arrived at the fox's hideaway, he shoved Pearl into and empty room and locked the door". While there are many such scenes in the Little Red Riding Hood genre of fairy tale, there is something particularly violent and dark in Stieg's portrayal. The image of Pearl cowering on the floor of the locked room awaiting her fate is disturbing to the extreme.  Notwithstanding a happy ending it's clear that this book can't be recommended for children, and that it isn't intended for adults. This being the case it is surprising that in 1977 it was recognized by the American Library Association as a Caldecott Honor Book. Certainly Steig's artful and evocative illustrations are remarkable, but should not have been sufficient, in and of themselves, for the conferring of this prestigious award 
 I used to think he was great, till I caught the Director's Cut of 'Das Boot.'  All of a sudden you're confronted with this ridiculous synthesizer music that wasn't in the original, and the spell is broken.  Let's not even talk about 'Air Force One.'  Now I've seen 'The Perfect Storm' twice, and I own the book, but I still haven't read it because I'm reasonably sure the book MUST suck if the movie is this bad.  And I'm sorry New England, but what are Gloucestermen anyways, except for great rapers of the high seas?  What will they NOT do for a buck, you might ask.  Ok, they are not as bad as the Japanese, but they all stalk the world on floating slaughterhouses like there's no tomorrow.  Watching this movie definitely made me take fish off the menu.  Sure you will find excitement aplenty, amped up to eleven.  Even experience fleeting moments when you might ponder the plight of seafarers throughout history.  I even like some of the principal actors, but in the end all they do is make a pretty bad movie slightly more interesting than it should be.  This just doesn't stand up to repeat viewings.  Unless you enjoy feeling like a sucker.  Do you 
 This cd is maaad weak.  The beats are wack, the lyrics are wack and C.B. is just swinging on Eightball and MJG'S fame to get his cd out.  By this time this is an oldie but it is as bad today as the day it was released.  I  would sell mine if I could find anyone to take it 
 Here is the first few lines of the chapter beginning on page 162:  Play is tactile...       Play is revealing... Play is active...        Play is cultural... Play is experimental...  Play is knowledge... Play is imaginative...   Play is curious...  In fact the entire chapter is 2 pages long consisting only of stuff like this.  The rest of the book is slightly better.  If you like this kind of stuff then buy it.  If you prefer something interesting to read and useful, I would recommend spending about the same amount of money on The Power of Simplicity 
 This film is beautifully acted by Kevin Spacey, but far too dark and gloomy for comfortable viewing.  It may indeed depict what the writer thought of the film world, but why inflict this depiction on the world I ask.  The story is cynical, cruel and I found the last half of the film very uncomfortable to watch.  Not a favourite 
 I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a "Wim" in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are "The Gift" and "Safe Harbour".  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try 
 Not only is there a filter for a product that claims to have none (putting aside whether it's needed in non-hard-water areas) but, more importantly, it fails to raise the total humidity to the multi-source recommended 40-45% level. In my office, with is exactly 1/2 the 350 square foot size that Honeywell claims the product can handle, the mister, going full blast, even over night, fails to deliver enough mist, even on the  highest setting, to nudge the baseline 25% humidity level up even one percent notch. So, yeah, it looks pretty, but you know what they say about looks aren't everything. I guess I need either to replace this thing or get another mister that is maybe less decorative and more functionally effective 
 I would trade this book in for one done on the same topic by somebody else. Zaloga is generally tops in the field, but other books in this series give you more for the money. For example, US Army Infantry Divisions of the same series gives you far more detail. Mr. Zaloga should take a look at that book before doing more - a new and higher standard exist. 
 This is a fairly helpful book for those born before the '70s-- a time when "a yarn" wasn't an archaic term. Does it give some helpful hints?  Sure, there's the obvious ones like show don't tell and all characters have free will. But fiction has changed a lot since Henry James (thankfully), and this book might be better left unread. Plus, I don't buy the "only people who aren't well-read don't like it" argument. I've read nearly all the books mentioned and I still wish I never bought this book 
 Is it fair to write a review of a book you thought was so stupid and ridiculous you chose not to finish it with only 75 pages to go 
 Could you guys (and gals) be more racist? "Asian women" are not monolithic. They are as diverse as "white women"--probably much more so. Yes, there are "meek" and docile Asian women, but there are also extremely aggressive, self-confident and challenging Asian women, too. And there's a lot in-between these extremes. If you want to stereotype a group, then stereotype the men who are attracted only to "meek" Asian women. They are the ones with the problem. I hope, too, the "Lebanese babe" thinks about how racist and disgusting her comments are.   Of course, the author of the book is also playing on racist stereotypes, despite being Asian herself (I assume), so she gets no sympathy from me either. She is equally vile 
 Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie 
 In general, I would credit the authors with doing a remarkable job of describing the need for committed relationships within the church for it to function as Christ intended.  And the greatest strength of the book is the stories that they tell to share with us the successes and struggles that various house churches have experienced over many years.  Those stories are very real and express the significant growth and value of house churches.  My problem with this book is the notion that house churches are the only place for real relationships to develop.  The caricature that they portray of small groups in more traditional churches is full of generalizations and simplifications.  They have chosen the worst of small groups and shown them to be the norm.  If I were to choose between the small groups described in this book and a house church, I would also think that house churches are the only way to go.  However, small groups have the potential, when done well, to offer significant vitality in the life of a traditional church.  Quality small groups, led by capable leaders, can retain many of the wonderful attributes that the authors describe from house churches.  And there are many wonderful benefits from a traditional church that are totally lost within the framework of house churches.  These attributes of contemporary church life are totally and inappropriately discarded as useless.    Ultimately, I think that the authors fall short by assuming the primacy of their approach.  Though I am pleased to learn how God is working through house churches to minister to so many people, I do not appreciate (or agree with) the suggestion that this model needs to ultimately replace traditional church life.    I intend to utilize some key insights that I garnered from this book to implement them within the context of our small groups.  And I will continue to thank the Lord for blessing me with an awesome church family, which allows me opportunities to connect and serve with people at our house within our small group but in so many other life-giving and transformational ways! 
 There's nothing new in this book that haven't already been said. I was fairly disappointed, as I was hoping for a book that explained to the point what people want to spend money on, and how to technically go about to get those images. Instead, I get "advice" that is nothing more than common sense.  In my opinion, you can skip this book entirely 
 Almost bought this in the store until I noticed there were case studies for both Win2K and WinXP. These are very similar operating systems and, sure enough, the text for the chapters is exactly the same for most of these two chapters. I do not understand why  interesting operating systems [FreeBSD, Mach] were left online in order that these two redundant chapters could be printed. Were it not for my familiarity with previous editions, I would assume the authors knew very little about OS concepts if they thought that covering 2K and XP would provide two distinct case studies for comparison. In short, the 2K coverage should have been replaced by one of the online chapters 
 "Tertium Organum", by P.D. Ouspensky (Uspenskii), a Russian mathematician-turned-mystic who studied under another Russian mystic, G.I. Gurdjieff, is characterized by its regression into Platonism with an Eastern philosophy/psychology undertone.  His conception of consciousness, "cosmic consciousness", as well as his interpretation of Einstein's Theory of Relativity and fourth dimension, is highly mystical and thus has little to do with reality qua reality.  The following is a comparison chart that demonstrates the difference between Aristotle's Organum and Ouspensky's Tertium Organum:              Organum:     A is A.                          A is not not-A.                          Each existent is either A or not-A.      Tertium Organum:     A is both A and not-A.                                 or                          All is A and A is all.  If A is both A and not-A, how can one identify A in the first place?  If Tertium Organum is true, then everything loses its identity and nothing can be known -- even Tertium Organum itself cannot be known.  Ouspensky recognizes that his logic is absurd and attempts to exculpate himself from this apparent contradiction by saying, "We must be prepared for the fact that it is impossible to express superlogical relations ("higher logic") in our language."   Ouspensky's philosophy is based upon a profound mistrust and contempt for man's "ordinary" cognitive process and the power of reason.  His philosophy leads to a complete denial of conceptual knowledge and his "higher logic" is a total negation of reality in the name of a "higher reality".  Only those individuals profoundly dissatisfied and unhappy with reality could aspire to such a philosophy.  Although, P.D. Ouspensky was one of the most brilliant Platonists in history, integrating Eastern mysticism into Platonism with remarkable intellectual sophistication, this brand of mysticism like any other is a symtom of man's default in epistemological integrity and the cause of all human suffering 
 This was a very thin book for the price. I didn't get a lot out of it. I love spiritual books but this one was not very informative and each page there was just a lot of repition. I got bored with it 
 After reading this title in an undergraduate philosophy class, and reading it carefully and thoroughly, I feel confident giving it a bad review.  It was selected by the professor, who I assume is a fan, but I know I, and all my friends in class, extremely dislike this book.  I'm a very strong student, an environmentalist, and whatever else you think I need to be a credible reviewer, but this book is very un-engaging.  If you're a professor yourself, I urge you not to use it in class.   The arguments are at times internally inconsistent (the author feels comfortable negating opponents for using the same argument structures she later uses), hyperbolic (the author creates extensive yet repetitive lists of victims of various injustices, redundantly reclassifying the same individual in several ways to make the list longer), and on and on.   The nail in the coffin, from a student's point of view, is that it does so in an extremely boring manner.  I feel bad that the first review is such a negative one, but from the eye of a undergrad, it's a really bad book.  Hopefully a professional philosopher can be more constructive, but undergrad students (its a class for majors and non-majors, to fill a core requirement) are not an appropriate audience for this book 
 Don't buy this product.  It was ill-fitting and incompatible with the coffee maker amazon matched it up with.  I returned mine and went with paper filters, which work so much better and are cleaner 
 The book was ok.  If you're a Couples fan you probably know most of what you're going to read already.  In some regards the author made Deborah out to be a little more "cartoonish' than she probably was.  Would've like  a little more depth rather than just remembrances of golf tournaments past 
 I'm not a fan of mysteries to begin with.  However, my public library has a limited selection of audio books, so I take what I can get.  I am a voracious reader, and I listen to audios to get more "reading" in, as you can listen and do other things.  I much prefer the Lillian Jackson Braun "cat" books, at least there is some humor, and I like the "mystery" part of these books better than Deaver's.  Sorry to all the Deaver fan's out there...I HAVE enjoyed a few of his books, but I get tired of the "same ole-same ole" 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 I am a disappointed in Ken Wilber for writing the Forward to a lay Catholic "mystic's" use or rather abuse of the integral path of Christianity.  He praises Marion for his claim that this book is `the first book to clearly describe the entire Christian spiritual path", meaning that Marion "includes the basic stages of spiritual development described so beautifully by the great saints and sages, plus the psychological stages of development only recently discovered by modern developmental psychologists."    It is clear from the book that although Marion studied seven years at a Catholic seminary, his theology and hermeneutics are on the level of a 13-year old gay alter boy who might be enlightened.  A warning to potential readers: if you are a non-Catholic do not even contemplate buying this book.  Marion is so full of Catholic indoctrination that he cannot divorce himself from it or be objective about it.  He still worships the "Virgin Mary" and is on a Catholic guilt trip, even though he tries very hard to convince the reader that the true mystic is sinless.  "It has always been the (Catholic) Church's tradition that the contents of all the books of the New Testament, including the letters of Peter and Paul, are the `revealed word of God.'  This means that they were either written by persons with the Christ Consciousness or that they were channeled from the Christ Consciousness of the Spirit."  (Pg 245.)  This total disregard for rationality and Wilber's careful explanation of holarchy is astounding.  Modern Protestant theologians like Sally McFague and Dorothee Soelle see the Bible at most as a Constitution for Christians, but never the "revealed word of God."    If you are a serious Christian who wants to travel on the Spiritual path to the mystical, buy and study Dorothee Soelle's "The Silent Cry - Mysticism and Resistance".      
 "The girl in a cafe" is a romantic story pretending to bring along a political message in the form of an ignoramus (main character - Gina) who is supposed to be the symbol of 'humanity'.  The movie starts off with an unlikely match of a British beurocrat fighting for the millenium goals to abolish world poverty starting with the G8 summit, with a (supposedly) charming girl he meets in a cafe, Gina. When she accompanies him to Rekjavik for the summit and as she learns more about his goals she becomes decidedly rude by attacking her beau's boss for not pushing for these goals hard enough. Not to mention, this bossman seems to be the only sensible character in the film, actually *trying* to make a change -- and not just having expensive breakfasts, dinners, and ranting to other people about not doing anything to make the world a better place (a.k.a. Gina).  And if this Gina character was supposed to represent Humanity, then I'm afraid the director/script writer has an oversimplified view of humanity itself. I don't think any average person on the street in any rich country wouldn't be heartbroken or at least quite bothered when he/she hears about how many poor children die everyday etc. But still nothing changes -- why? Not because those '8 men in the room' in the G8 summit don't care -- but because they represent the very nature of humanity of the masses they are ruling. Like Gina, everyone gets engrossed in their own lives and luxuries, but unlike Gina most of us would atleast appreciate the people who are spending their lives trying to make a change (i.e., the bosses of the 'Millenium project' that she attacks), rather than being blind to our own humanity while living off of luxury but maintaining this 'holier than thou' attitude. 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 I'm not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot. It's redundant and unnecessary, and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent. Only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself. Double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that's based on and well...  My gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it's original format onto DVD was bad. The soundtrack is about 1/2 to 1 second off from the video part of film, therefore the voices don't sync up with the lip movement. 
 As a math and computer teacher, I thought I would see information for my students, however, this book is old already.  Under computers where are the MIS and CIS jobs?  What about Web Master or computer and electrical  engineering?  Also, there is misinformation.  One cannot now become a  physical therapist with a BS, let alone a "certificate".   Physical Therapy is now a 6 year program at all universities.  One receives  a Masters of Physical Therapy degree.  I am very disappointed in Ms.  Field's book 
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 The closest Rita will ever get to emulating "Murder, She Wrote" is in the title of this book. The similarities end there. Anyone can write about the illicit drug trade, a subject Rita should have had the good sense to stay away from. She added nothing to the discussion worth reading. And she still doesn't know what she is talking about when it comes to law enforcemnt 
 I didn't enjoy reading this book. I found it to be too dry and very structured. Useful ideas but not m cup of tea 
 This book was a great book. I like the way Trent was helped by Nick. One thing I didn't like was the violence. I am not a big fan of basketball, or any other sport, but this book really touched me. I would recommend this book to anyone even if they aren't a lover of sports. That is what I thought about Night Hoops.      Sunny Block 
 According to the author everyone has a built-in "blueprint for life." Her job and the reader's job is to discover what that is. But the discovery process is decidedly non analytical; trying to understand the past - the why's of this world - is non constructive, if not negative, in this venture. The reader, patient, or client ( the author runs a life coaching business ) must be future oriented, focusing on "wants" and not "shoulds." One should rely upon intuition and feelings far more so than "information." Furthermore, all areas of life are equally open to this approach: career, relationships, etc. Details on a micro level are irrelevant or get in the way.  Like virtually every so-called "self-help" book, the author maintains that the person in need of help is the primary obstacle to success. It is up to him or her to make the life-changing transformation, with of course the possible help of a life coach. The author gives the example of deciding on the day on which she was to be admitted to a mental facility, after five years of depression and therapy, to suddenly change her life. Apparently, multi-year depression is some sort of superficial malady that can be cast aside in a heartbeat, if only properly motivated. Also in keeping with the genre, the author admits to no social or economic structures or conditions that can and do present very real obstacles in attaining success in life. Issues like class, vastly unequal resources, or power dynamics apparently do not exist in the author's world. Being down-sized from a thirty year career is just another "opportunity" in life-coach speak, not a devastating blow that can be extremely difficult to overcome for many realistic reasons.  Granted it is possible to think one's situation to death. Analysis can be paralysis. But is success in life merely identifying wants, adopting the right attitudes, and getting out of the way to let it all happen? At one point, the author suggests that the "best life cannot help but find you." For many, life is just a bit more complicated despite efforts made that are least equal to any detailed in her book.  The target audience is not particularly clear. In one example, the author describes a supervisor becoming more effective by asking an employee "what" questions as opposed to "why" questions. That sounds like Mgt 101, not life transformation. In another case, a manager has "negative" guilt over firing an employee. When he realizes that he is helping the firm, apparently that constitutes "living your best life." And then there is the other extreme of  the author going from admittance to a hospital to life coach and successful author in a matter of a few years.   The book is just overly simplistic. It makes both unreal, exaggerated claims and does not realistically examine life's complexities and the difficulties in assessing and solving problems. In that regard, it may actually perform a disservice. The book offers mostly life cheerleading, which may be exactly what some are looking for.  
 I haven't much of recent seagal films, but the reason I pick up a Seagal film isn't here,  where are those nasty wrist locks and irimi nage moves?  When did he turn into a guy that does spinning back kicks and jumping hook kicks.  (I know its a stunt double doing those caz there's no shot of Seagal's face)  This movie was entertaining, but its not what Seagal is all about.  I know he's older, but hey remember Sean Conery in the move "the Rock", well that was more believable,  why don't they make Seagal into some ex or retired bad ass special forces dude that they need back, at least that might work for him 
 The musicians and the songs beat most contemporary bands but I had to rate it an overall two stars due the electic clashing style 
 I was very excited when I found out that Noreen Crone-Findlay was going to do an entire book on crocheted dolls. However after buying the book , andgetting a chance to go through it...I must say that I am very disappointed. It's perhaps the most disappointing book I've ever purchased. The dolls in it are very amateur in their presentation. Few of her examples/projects rise to a standard equal to that of someone just learning the craft. Most of the projects seem like an explosion of yarn. Your craft book dollars would be best spent elsewhere 
 This book was printed in 2002 and is SO out of date that it is really not worth having.  Very disappointing 
 I'm a fan of Mem Fox. I use her books in my class. This one, Hunwick's Egg,is a little disappointing. The main character finds an egg and we all expect it to hatch. But it doesn't and I missed the point of the book.If you like Mem Fox's books, then give it a try 
 I think the author is ignorant about Ottoman World Wide State or he has some special idealism to write whole stupid things even though everything had been explained about This one of the biggest World Wide State in the history  and it is easy to see the reality that you need the quality to be the best in anything , since you were the best in the ancient time it is so disgusting that somebody like the author came out and vomit some gossips  I m sorry but I think so and I hope in the future Ottoman`s mission will be displayed with hono 
 I have had this camera since Jan '05 and have so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while on trips and at weddings.   Don't expect much from it and you will be happy. As an entry level DSLR it does what it's supposed to do in ideal conditions. I find it's strength is in taking people photographs in bright light, provided that they are not moving.    Cons:  In landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it's inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well.  Battery dies FAST. The battery I got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting, especially when shooting in RAW mode. I have yet to fill up a 1Gig card when shooting in RAW mode(Approx 150 shots) before the battery dies. Surprisingly when shooting jpegs, I get more shots per charge(Over 300) but hardly enough to last a day. I cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while I was out on a hike. So I always carry a backup film camera (my trusty Elan 7).  The viewfinder is very dim. When I look through my Elan 7 and then through the 300D, it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300D's viewfinder. In indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap, especially when having to resort to manual focus.   Autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible. When shooting indoors, the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject. I have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur. This is despite having a 420Ex Flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus.  The 420EX flash is supposed to "talk" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed. However, with the 300d, this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over/under exposed.   After about five months, the shutter button started sticking. I would click it and then it would remain depressed. The shutter button would only pop back up after I jiggled it a little.  Another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button. And since there is only one thumbwheel, it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed. For example, if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature, then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel. When you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera, this is a real annoyance.  So would I recommend this camera: If you are a casual point and shoot person, it's an affordable entry into DSLRs that produces decent photos. But if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately, look elsewhere 
 About a year ago I submitted a review of this much-discussed volume, and promised to enlarge upon the subject after giving the regimen and medicaments a fair chance. Several kind souls have expressed their  appreciation for the original review, and asked for any new information I  might have about my person.  In the interest of science, and ridding myself  of the joys of arthritis, I have consumed cubic miles of chondroitin and  glucosamine sulfates; I have grazed upon greens; I have eschewed almost  every eatable, drinkable and smokable damned or even tut-tutted by the  authors - for a while, anyway. I still have arthritis. It does not have me.  If any improvement came about through this Spartan experience it could only  be detected by the most powerful instruments in the known universe. I shall  not, in future, invest in any more of the pills; I have just celebrated my  freedom with a beefsteak, which we discussed over a capital Hermitage, and  topped off with about an acre of gooseberry pie. As I write this, I am  savouring a good cigar. I speak only for myself in this regard, for I note  other reviews and comments diametrically opposed. Well, everyone to their  own taste, as the old woman said when she kissed the cow. Probably I, a  skeptic from the cradle, lack the faith necessary to derive benefits;  perhaps my metabolism is not in tune with the free radicals, or whatever  they are, that do the work.  Pity, as I said before, that a true scientific  test was not conducted by the authors. As presented, 'The Arthritis Cure'  and its offspring give off a decided odour of snake-oil. Anecdotes are  entertaining. Data are convincing 
 The opening chapter of this book describing the history of Vogue Dolls and Jennie Graves is really wonderful stuff, but as an identification guide, this book just doesn't make it.  I think the authors and Collector Books  would have created something incredible by splitting this into two volumes  and not cramming so much information into such a confined space.There are  hundreds of different dolls and outfits shown, but the information we need  for good identification is lacking.  The pictures are tiny, the shoes  and/or feet of many of the dolls are cut off in the photo so it's  impossible to tell what they are wearing.  The small pieces to outfits  aren't shown - if a dressed doll is wearing panties, how do we know what  they look like?  Details of accessories are incomplete - if Jill and Ginny  had a revolver with their Cowgirl outfits, what was it like?  Was it metal,  plastic, was it completely silver in color or did it have a colored handle?   This is the information that helps me as a collector when I'm sorting  through bits and pieces at doll shows or trying to figure out what might be  missing in a collection I'd like to buy.A huge book like this obviously  took hundreds(if not thousands) of hours to research and put together, and  I applaud the authors for that effort.  Publishing this kind of work rarely  has little monetary gain, but is done purely for a love of the hobby.  If  this book succeeds in interesting people in Vogue dolls, then it's a  positive thing, but as a complete or definitive resource for collectors, I  will still have to hunt and peck through several books for the information  I need 
 Having enjoyed other books by Mr. White in the past, I was enthusiastic about ordering this book. Once into it, however, I was bored silly with the self-pitying Austin, much time is spent on his concern with being 50-something and increasingly fat; the girly whimpering princess-like Peter; and the neurotic, poorly adjusted, lecturing Julien. Not to mention the nauseous youngsters that early on make up Austin's Paris social group. Another negative was the revolting obsession of this book with the European bourgeois, always present with it's titled people, nobility and wannabes, creme-de-la-creme socialites and the gaseous Austin's attachment to all the above. Austin's character to me was weak and unbelievable, heaping gifts and adoration on everyone he had met in the past regardless of how they treated him. The only portion of this book I found interesting and in keeping with the quality writing style of Mr. White was the brief fling Austin had in Providence with the homeless man recently out of prison. I found the main love story sugary and mundane, the characters dull, and the constant berating of American culture overdone. To summarize this book, I would considering it the droning love lost lament of a middle-aged pedophile socialite absorbed with the lifestyle of the rich of Paris 
 Many of the reviews I read felt strongly in favor of this remake, but some of the people had not seen "An Affair to Remember".  Cary Grant & Deborah Kerr had the spark so lacking in this "Love Affair" remake.  The original "Love Affair" with (forgive me, I can only remember Irene Dunne as Terry, and my opinion that film was not as good as this "Love Affair", however. I missed hearing the original scoring of "An Affair to Remember", but Annette Benning's music with the children was lovely.  As most of the reviews that stated they were in favor of "An Affair...", I missed the climactic ending with Cary Grant's reactions, and also the shipboard scene where he want's to be "worthy of her love".    I don't wish to underrate or "dump" on this film, but I wish all reviewers would watch the Grant/Kerr version just once.  I believe they will become "old movie buffs" too.  Thanks for reading my review 
 It's okay :'( I like it somewhat, but it seems really short since they 11 tracks aren't all full songs. The two "New Direction" tracks are really short. The album has the hit songs "Every Morning", "Falls Apart", and "Someday" 
 It has been awhile since I received my AS degree in Accounting.  Therefore, I saw taking a Full Charge Bookkeeping course at Fayetteville Technical Community College as a great opportunity for a review.  I did not get past the first 3 chapters before I started finding errors.  Some of them were small such as a different company name listed on the answer sheet than was on the homework.  But when I got to chapter 10 were I am completing the whole accounting cycle including journalizing transactions, posting to ledgers, preparing trial balances and financial statements, and closing entries, things really got messy.  One entire problem in the answer section was wrong.  The wrong dollar amount was incorrectly posted to the worksheet which made net income understated.  Closing entries were reversed which indicated a net loss instead of net income.  I am very upset.  I have 4 other classmates and this information is brand new to them.  Several of them stopped their work completely becasue they thought they had the wrong answer after checking the answer sheet.  I am very disappointed in this book.  I have 12 more chapters to go and I do not think things will get any better.  I will also write to publisher about this because my classmates and I want our money back.  DO NOT GET THIS BOOK 
 I am a proclaimed lover of musicals and movie musicals and I was incredibly disappointed by Gigi. As if the overdone french accents aren't enough to turn one off altogether the acting is ridiculously overdramatic and forced. The one redeeming thing in most musicals is at least the song and dance aspect, however for me that might have been the worst part. The songs were repetitive and catchy in a way that makes you want a lombotomy or temporary memory loss to get those stupid tunes and words out of your head. The moral of this story is, spend your time and money on the plethora of wonderful movie musicals and stay far away from this on 
 Although this book didn't really live up to expectations, I will at least say it provided an entertaining read.  If you're already familiar with contemporary sci-fi you won't find too many new ideas here.  A lot of the ground in this book has already been covered in works like "The Diamond Age" (Neal Stephenson - nanotech opus), "Neuromancer" (William Gibson - disembodied ID shifting), "Ender's Game" (Orson Scott Card - automated education) or "The Transmigration of Timothy Archer" (Phillip K. Dick - tricked out humans).  Of course the main difference here is that Mr. Kurzweil is not a sci-fi author but a proven inventor and entrepeneur.  He acknowledges the 'speculative non-fiction' aspects of the book but at times gets carried away with his predictions and occasionally sounds like a hokey traveling salesman.  Throughout the book he claims some degree of expertise in such broad ranging interests as nanotechnology, neurology, interactive entertainment, visual arts, biology, anthropology, philosophy, ethics and sexuality.  Granted the material draws on many of these disciplines but his arguments often come to conclusions that simply have no scientific basis.  This book, published in 1999 suggested that our brains will be "scanned" in the near future.  The concept sounds very Ghost-In-The-Shell and has about as much plausibility as a typical Japanese animation.  An article appearing in the October 2004 issue of Discover asked the question, "Will anyone ever decode the human brain"? The author, much less optimistic than Kurweil noted that "No conceivable technology will be subtle enough to discern all the memories, emotions, and meanings aroused in us by our perceptions."  He made this assumption based on the fleeting nature of the actual neurons in your brain that change and evolve rapidly every day.  To equate this mush with bits and bytes, jpegs and mp3's, is a little naive and ridiculously optimistic.  Hopefully it will happen someday, maybe even in our lifetime.  Until then though, you'd be better off reading real fiction...  This book's (almost) saving grace is Kurzweil himself.  He's obviously having fun writing this book and presumably hopes to raise some eyebrows.  Even when that comes off as legacy-building ("Remember - you read that here first!") it's oddly charming.  Inserting himself into a dialogue with his fictitious creation "Molly" is at first obnoxious, condescending even, but by the end it's actually pretty amusing.    That said, if you're holding out for some deep insight as to what a "spiritual machine" might be, I'll save you the trouble by telling you that the author's angle (in the two pages it's mentioned) is that spirituality basically boils down to biological phenomena.  Sorry, that it.  Apparently that was good enough for Mr. Data so it's also good enough Mr. Kurzweil.  Computers will one day magically start loving - once they're smart enough of course.  In the mean time, we can gloss over the fact that subjective AI is still a non entity in our world 
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
 Unless you are seriously into coming of age movies you can skip this one.  Critics love this film because it conforms to the modern liberal message that you should have sex with basically anyone.  The attempt to make the protagonist Milos into a tragic hero as a resistance fighter fails because it is obviously unimportant addition to the main story, which is that a young man should have sex early and have sex often 
 Continuing in the fashion of Talib fallin' off.  This ish was ultra terrible....................Again............WTF?   One of my favorite emcees, making this ish.  The single with Bilal (sounds like something you catch on your feet) was terrible.  I was truly hurt when I scanned the cd, and there was nothing, and I do mean nothing, to put on the XBOX!!!  Again...........WTF?  After I sold this "train of thought" back, I knew his albums were ugly not beatiful struggles to listen to from here on out.  From the height @ Rawkus to this ish, right down the drain, like the rest of the label.  By the way, what are they doin?  Why this album sucks: 1)  Talib fell da f*ck off 2)  It's wack 3)  Him and DJ Quik don't mix, and that song was on Soundboming 3 4)  Reusing a song from compilation disk 5)  Commercial 6)  Coaster material 7)  Opposite of album title 8)  Beats 9)  Lyrics 10)  Ultra wack as @#$%*&^ in all languages  Bottom Line:  Talib should have taken that cheap muthaph*cka and wiped his @$$ wit it FO, REAL!!!!!!!!!!   Peace!!!!!!!!  P.S.  Amazon won't let me rate it 0 stars 
 I am having a hard time understanding why people have raved about this book.  I guess everyone is entitled to have loyal fans, but I just don't see what was great, or even good, about this story.  Two teenagers enter a school and end up killing seven people.  They are caught, they confess, and the Grandmother of one of the killers hires Spenser to prove the boy's innocense.  We are given the impression a great mystery, with possible red herrings, is about to entertain us.  Alas, it is not to be.  The kids did it, plain and simple.  Why they did it is so stupid.  The story reads as though a sixth grader has written it.  The plot is lame, and even as lame as it is, it isn't executed well at all.  The characters are boring and 2 dimensional.  The banter which takes place between the main character and others, while it seems to be trying to be witty, is just dumb and unbelievable.  I just can't say enough about how stupid this story is.  There are too many wonderful mystery authors out there writing gripping, intense works of fiction to waste your time on this one.  This is the first novel I have read by this author and will most definitely be my last 
 Tahiti 80 just doesn't do it for me. If you're into the likes of silly, light-hearted pop tunes, then maybe it's for you. Nothing is soul moving or stirring. I heard a coupla of harkenings of chili peps riffs here and there, but it just didn't get it 
 While Malamud is without doubt a very skilled writer, I gave up attempting to read this book approximately 1/3 of the way through it.  The atmosphere of the book was overwhelmingly dour and depressing: story after story of loneliness, poverty, bleakness, bitterness, struggle, alienation from family.  It leaves one ready to jump off a bridge somewhere 
 Love that when amazon deletes all the reviews for a product! Well, this one used to have about 3 five-star ratings. I added my two cents- this product did nothing for me whatsoever. So, some people love it. I don't get it. And, it's pretty much the opposite of an anti-oxidant, so that doesn't make sense. I pointed this out in my review. Wonder if vendors have the choice to delete all reviews if they get one bad enough?  Also, it's listed at $45 on amazon as well. from the same supplier. huh 
 Today I read One Taste by Ken Wilbur. Well, I read through it - couldn't finish it. Quite frankly I didn't understand what all the buzz was about. Nothing revolutionary. In fact, disappointing.     I really enjoyed some of his earlier publications, and continue to be inspired by the Holonomy book he edited: The Holographic Paradigm and Other Paradoxes. I definately recommend it, or better yet, Reenchantment of the World by Morris Berman.     But One Taste is supposed to give us a small taste of his inner thoughts via his private daily journal. Al Gore and Bill Clinton were both seen carrying it around, I guess to give us the impression that they are philosphically and spiritually contemplative. Reviewers called it: profound, dizzying, epiphanic, multi-dimensional, "expansive talk of higher states of being"...and I don't get it.     Most of the questions he was asking were things we studied in Philophy 101 and 201, and dare I say, it bored me then as much as it bores me now. Things like, whether or not there is one primal force behind all religions (an Eliadean quest); how religion can be proved "objectively"; uniting psychology and other disciplines with spirituality (without substantial elaboration); if the New Age movement and postmodernism are just fads (a term which he didn't bother to define); how dualism is bad (again, without substantial elaboration); whether truth is subjective or objective, etc.     Not to mention, downright boring in parts - I don't really care what TV shows he watches, his shopping habits, etc. And at parts, self-absorbed. Lots of name dropping. Lots. And lots. Name dropping on almost every page. It's hard to criticize a person's private thoughts, but it kinda sounds like a yuppie boomer with some middle-age crisis questions. It's amazing what some people consider profound.     Want radical? Progressive? Compelling? Why not question the notion of middle class, the addiction called money, the concept of "career", the US economic system as myth...and check out The Way We Never Were, by Stephanie Coontz. I just started it, and love it's challenges to our concept of reality, the myths that we are conditioned to accept as "objective history", and the way most of us organize our lives.    Here Wilber mostly stays in the philosophical /theoretical realm, which is ironic, given that his contributions in Holonomy discuss the disembodied self, and that he considers himself an activist of sorts. But I don't see Wilber doing anything practical with this thought - it comes off as reflections mixed in with some marketing appeal to the so-called intellectual and class elites.    Stick to his prior books 
 Unfortunately the book I ordered never came. You sent the wrong one, then I sent it back. You said you sent the right one next, but sent another wrong book instead. I never received the book I wanted, I sent both books you shipped back 
 This has to be the worst book I have read in a long time. The plot is bad, the characters unbelievable (that's not unbelievable as in WOW - but unbelieveable as in just awful), and the writing really bad. I have read books by this author before and this one is such a let down. I am so angry at myself for reading to the end but even angrier at the author for writing such a bad book. The only good thing about it is that I borrowed it from the library rather than paying for it 
 I bought this believing that it was chalked full of "full length" videos of the sweet performing. Instead we get three very boring men discussing a very small amount of information on the band. The three men consist of one of the song writers, the guitarist and an early manager. The song writer has more gravel to his voice than Tom Waits, the guitarist is sadly very bloated, and the manager is slouched on a sofa wearing khaki shorts complaining about how the band should have gotten into arena rock. (He's the worst of the three!)  Just as I was enjoying "wig wam bam" when the video cuts off and back to the chat! No little Willy video at all! They also don't include more than 30 secs of the  "love is like oxygen" video. That's sick to fool the fans into thinking they're buying a music video/concert dvd when it's simply a lame documentary. Don't buy it, watch the videos of youtube or buy a dvd from the UK.  
 Yes it will be nice to learn few things about Nuremberg while following a live personal story. The problem is that this live personal story completely fails to click. 
 This book was not what I expected at all. I thought the information was very general and there were far too many pages devoted to answering questions (where you fill in the blanks) and not enough real information provided by the author 
 There are simply too many mediocre songs in this collection. It seems to be an error in judgement on the compiler's part. They're not underground classics, either - just vaguely experimental disco songs. They often seem pedestrian, with poor structure. There's also a lot of early synth pop in here - rather mechanical German-sounding disco. When you come across a good song, like BBQ's 'On the Beat', you realise how disposable much of the rest of the material is.  The quality of the transfers is very high, there's no doubt about it. And to a certain extent it is a fun collection. But there's probably too much forgettable material here. Would it really be any great loss if we didn't have Macho's 'I'm a Man'? I haven't heard the first volume, and there seems to be more classics on that ('Get Down Saturday Night', 'Superfreak' and so on). Part of the problem may be its European origins - they often prefer inorganic sounding dance music, more urban-industrial stuff.  There's one more problem - I think. I might be wrong about this, but when the CD was mastered, the volume seems pitched a bit low. I noticed this one other time with a CD from the Netherlands - it's a bit irritating to have to turn it up. If you listen to Soul Jazz's CDs you realise how good a CD can be. Overall I'm tempted to say skip this. There are better disco and Old School collections out there - I'm looking forward to hearing Soul Jazz's "A Tom Moulton Mix. 
 We've received this toy as a gift from our friends and i liked the idea of 2 sides (is like having 2 new toys at once). But then, when we tried playing with it i didn't like several things: 1) side 1  - has a really hard to squeak thing,  - hard to pull hammer  - pretty far located smiley face so the baby playing with it as an activity table (not crib mounted) won't easily reach and press it - smiley face could have more than 1 melody playing It results in that side having only 3 things to play for the baby at 6-8 months: spinning flower, spinning ball and a mirror  2) side 2 - the most i don't like in this toy (both sides) is the music of those 4 musical instruments buttons. It sounds not like it's a baby toy but like it's some kind of tool to horrify the baby. We have pretty much musical toys and none of them has the music which is soooo unpleasant. My baby just looks at tose buttons as she looks at strangers she doesn't like. - pop-up thing - could have a better holding door (opens easily) and prettier "animal" inside. - the squeaky knob on this side is hard to push even for me.  To summarize i'll just say that as for me even 2 sides are not worth the money!   I don't like it at all 
 First off let me make it known that I am a huge TD fan.  I have over 20 of their albums.... mostly from the late 80's to the present, and including the Tangents box set.  There might be one song out of my whole collection that I don't like (one of the songs off of Rockoon).  I have all four of the Dream Mixes as well, and find this one by far the worst out of the four Dream Mixes as well as all the rest of my collection.  In my oppinion Jerome as completely lost when this was written.  The disc has no flow, rhyme, or reason to it.... it is music that goes absolutely no where.  About a year ago I bought an album from ex TD member Johannes Schmoelling "White Out" that was highly recomended to me and the both of these albums remind me of each other.... PUTRID!!!!  Since I bought this ablum I have only listened to it twice.  The first time was just to get to know it.  The second time was in effort to go back and see if there was something that maybe I was missing.  I have tried to listen to it a third time but end up turning it off becuase I got so bored listening to it.  SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR TIME!!!!  TD has a lot of great music but this one is horrible!  
 I read chic-lit, a lot. I found myself truly disappointed in this book. What a waste of time! 
 I knew this book was a marketing ploy. ''Supposedly'' written by one of the deceased plane crash passengers onboard the doome flight Oceanic 815 in the tv show LOST, this new-found book was, as the story goes, published postmortem for our enjoyment. I did not buy the book to find secrets on the show's consipracies. I was honestly curious about what this book would have to offer. But this juvenile and badly written mystery has very little to offer.  Investigator Artisan is used to the very easy cases he picks up. But when Clifford Widmore hires him to find Alexander, his lost twin, Artisan picks up a case that... well I don't really know what 'that' is since the mystery is practicaly nonexistant in this book. Artisan travels to California, South Keys, Cuba, Australia. And for what? Well just for the nice settings it seems. Why is it so important that he finds Alexander? Why care?  The book is slim but even at only 260 pages, reading this one felt like an eternity. Badly written with silly situation and ridiculous dialogue, the whole thing made me grown and grind my teeth. When Artisan finally arrives in Australia, he meets Pru, a woman who seems perfect for the first three pages. But her secret identity is too quickly revealed and the plot stalls yet again. Why add this character when she obviously offers very little to the story, if anything at all? This book is full of whys, just not the right kind of whys.   And even for Lost fans, this one offers little. The so-called hints to find in this book about the show's conspiracy seem tacked on for no particular reason and quite unnecessary. Why add these three or four quick scenes at all? Why publish this book at all?  A great mystery needs one key element. A mystery. This one had very little of it to be found. You can guess the ending from a mile away and none of the characters are ever interesting enough for you to care for any of them. Skip this one. Stick to the tv show. 
 My children at the center thought this was the greatest thing.  Only problem is after 2 sets, it doesnt last.  The velcro wears out.  I ended up purchasing a plastic set that is lasting better 
 This text and CD set gives a decent practical introduction to Italian, with clear and manageable grammar information. I would estimate that it is equivalent to a college semester of a language, if you learn this text well.  CDs give very clear and lovely examples of Italian conversational speech. One can follow along in the text; this is very helpful.  The format of the text, however, makes it somewhat difficult to review, and there isn't even a vocabulary list at the end of each chapter! This is a serious flaw.  I would prefer also extensive review exercises at the end of the chapter.  Instead, there are only small practice sessions embedded in the the text. I would like this format--it makes it seem manageable--if only there were also review sections at the end 
 This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile 
 Enjoying Bright Lights, Big City (20 years ago), and after seeing decent reviews for this, I looked forward to reading the Good Life.   On the positive side, it was a quick read, whose soap opera story lines (that's the guilty part)and sound storytelling keeps you involved and pushing forward. But, as an earlier reviewer pointed out, it becomes played out as a modern version of the Great Gatsby where the shallow characters become people you could care less about, and the dialog between those characters becomes increasingly abysmal. If you do read it, the telephone exchanges between the two primary characters is particularly painful.  
 Just for everyone's information -- and my own ego -- although I am listed as the author of both the first and second editions of this book, and I did write the first edition, the second edition was produced without my participation. I take NO responsibility for the second edition. I am currently updating the book, and a third edition, written in the style of the first edition, will be available soon.  Jo Lynn Southar 
 Loved the concept of this camera...small, 10x zoom and sleek looking, BUT the first one lasted 3 days, had it replaced and the second one lasted 1 week.   Both stopped operating completely.  So given that kind of problem I do not recommend this camera 
 I agree with some of the other reviews. There is some helpful information in this book but it's nothing which can't be found elsewhere. It might be worth reading but I suggest skipping the examples since they contain too many errors, and aren't spaced or documented well enough for easy understanding and debugging.  
 This was a somewhat enjoyable book until about 2/3 of the way through it. It became an excrutiatingly slow read. However, if you want to read up on HIV and it's symptoms/emotions, you might enjoy it 
 Almost every character in this book is unlikeable, unbelievable, and leads a life of unremitting misery, to no end.  Morris gratuitously gives even her most minor characters sickening motives and gross stupidity.  Morris writes well, but her vision of reality is badly flawed.  The book is a mess, so depressing that, thank God, by the end it's almost laughable.  
 Snoop comes with a very disappointing third effort and first on No Limit since leaving the Death Row Empire.  All in all this cd has quite a few below average tracks and only one great one and about 6-8 good ones (21 total songs are on the cd so only about 40% of the cd is quality).  Features too many songs with No Limit artists (something they are known for).

 I'm very glad that so many readers liked this book, and that it's been a good one for Vietnam vets.  But I felt that this book never found its way.  It felt like snapshots from a depressive life, intermingled with a thriller.  I guess it just didn't work for me as literature, or as a thriller.  I was was drawn to O'Nan by his work in Granta 54, but I probably won't try him again 
 Kramer seems to think that we have strayed from the path of letting the People decide constitutional issues. There are significant reasons why Madison and others thought that would be a problem. Freedom of speech, for example, is something that the majority of voters or their representatives in congress would do away with in an instant if it weren't for the Supreme Court. Freedom of speech is fine until some group like the communists or the nazi party tries to exercise it, then legislators try to make laws saying they can't. In our constitution it is imperative to have a less political branch deciding these issues. Yes, the Supremes make unpopular decisions sometimes, but that is their job. Allowing the boneheads in congress to decide important constitutional issues would be folly. They would play to the lowest common denominator and have us giving away our rights in the name of God or security or morality. The Constitution has a way for the people to check the Supreme Court. We can impeach them or amend the constitution. Kramer's book looks back on the golden age in 1800 when we voted out a political party because of the unconstitutional laws they passed. Does he deny the havoc some poorly thought out laws could wreak in 21st century America? We don't have time to allow people to take away American's rights with the idea we might get them back in the next election 
 I love paranormal romance and based on the amazon reviews thought this would be a winner. Master of Wolves was a fast read, but I didn't find myself drawn into the story. I expect complex, developed characters where the reader becomes invested in their story and outcome.  This book just didn't do it for me.  When the author started explaining the background mythos, she totally lost my respect. I have a pretty vast willing suspension of disbelief - but Merlin being an alien? Arthur is a vampire? I actually laughed with disbelief and had a hard time forgiving it. Granted, this is the fourth book in the series, so perhaps it would feel more plausible if I'd read them first.   My suggestion - if you're into werewolves skip this one and read "Killng Moon" by Rebecca York   
 Ok, I had to watch this movie for my Earth Science class, and it was good, but oh my God. I wanted to just punch some people! It was decent, only because of Tommy Lee Jones and Don Cheadle (I don't know how to spell his last name, but you know whom I'm talking about). Anyone else? Pf. Not cool.  Tommy Lee Jones plays this emergency help guy/dad, and he does it well. In the movie he fathers this 13-year old who can't really grasp onto the word "responsibility" until the very end. Its weird that he doesn't know what 'lava' is. You'll find that a bit weird.  Theres a part in the movie, where the construction guy (real ass in the beginning) goes in a subway car and saves the already dead driver, and he's moving sloooowly, murmuring a prayer, and when he gets to the ledge, the lava hasn't moved from out and under the subway yet. He stands there, hesitating. I was shouting "JUMP" like an obnoxious idiot. Then the lava came from under the subway train, and it flowed like, five feet in front of him. Finally (!) he jumps, throws the dead man to his co-workers and melts.  Another death scene: 2 geologists go down into the storm drain, and one finds the fissure. She's peeking in it, observing, concurring. Then, like a flash, an earthquake. The other geologist is messing with her flashlight, so she really doesn't notice what's happening. The concurring one suddenly tries to move away from it, but the fissure widens, which makes her fall. Heres the suspenseful part: shes hanging on the ledge. "Help me! Don't let go of me!" she begs, as the other geologist grabs her arm. Sadly, the glove that the ailing woman was wearing slides off, and bam. Dies.  TLJ's on-screen daughter is in charge of 2 children at a shelter. She goes off somewhere and comes back to find the youngest gone. So, she goes and looks for him and finally finds him outside where the BIG eruption was going to happen. The building behind her, though, is about to collapse. She like, realizes this, and she just stands there, holding the child, wailing for her dad. Its like, 'ok, RUN'.  OVERALL. This movie is ok if you like the whole disaster film thing. Its cheesy, but its good. I prefer this to Twister. It will make you not want to live in/move out of California, though. That's a caution you should take 
 At first this thing was great, in 20 minutes (not 15) it would charge the batteries.  The problems came later when batteries started showing up as "bad" according to the charger, even brand new ones.  A few at first then a lot more.  I have other travel chargers that would charge the "bad" batteries over 8 hours and they would work fine.  Often after this the Energizer charger would charge batteries previously identified as "bad."  After about a year I discovered that the charger was destroying the batteries.  New and old, they would end up bad after a few cycles through this charger, so that even the slow chargers would not charge them.  Many times the charger would not charge them at all, just wait 20 minutes and turn green as if they were done.  Not good when you discover dead "charged" batteries while taking pictures on vacation.  I'd recommend going with slower chargers, inconvenient as they are.  The super fast charge time has destroyed a few dozen expensive NiMH batteries.  I'm looking for one that'll charge a dozen at once....if they make one that is 
 I had to read this book as part of a Masters-Level class on organizational management. I would offer it up for sale, but I intend to burn it when class is over.  Unless you want to read a book written by people who are SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOU ARE (he said with an extra helping of sarcasm), do yourself a favor and skip this book.  It a bunch of religous, self-righteous, fairy tale dogma.  Horrible, horrible book.  Will look nice when it's burnt to a crisp, however 
 I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world 
 This is probably one of the most annoyingly worst albums I've ever heard in my life.   What is this? If you like this, than like it. But I just can't see what situation I'd ever be in that could call for something as annoying as this.   In the woods?  Nope In my car?  Nope On the ocean?  Nope I really just can't figure this kind of music out.  and I listen to wacked out music...but...I don't know man. It may be a New England thing or something. Yo.  I found this really cute album.  Oh....ohhhh....yeeah. Worst ever 
 When I purchased this, I was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped.   The skin is so thin, that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons.  The belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that I used it.  Don't waste your money, spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while.  
 This very thick book is full of detailed research, and chock full of studies, but completely devoid of answers to questions about why one submits to eating disorders. I bought it trying to gain some personal insight as to why I felt ruled by this behavior, and after reading this tome, am still in the dark. If you want to do a research paper and site studies, this book is for you, but if you want some insight as to what makes someone give into the compulsive/addictive behavior, definitely look elsewhere. I gave it two stars because I didn't know how else to rate it. It was completely not what I thought it was 
 I'm not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot. It's redundant and unnecessary, and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent. Only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself. Double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that's based on and well...  My gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it's original format onto DVD was bad. The soundtrack is about 1/2 to 1 second off from the video part of film, therefore the voices don't sync up with the lip movement. 
 I am shoked that this book got an average score of 4 stars. Yes, I read it even after I swore never to read another dragonlance book again.  I wont get into the details of the book except to say it is yet one more disgrace to the once great Dragonlance saga.  If the book had gotten 2 or 3 stars I might think it was just a disagreement of tastes.  But 4 stars makes me think the rating system is somehow being manipulated 
 This book is for those pastors who are wanting new insights and resources for ministering to a postmodern society.  The strength of these authors' writing is their dedication to ministering to the postmodern concept of family.  However, they state, "Our definition of family is more empirical than ideological.  It takes `what is' seriously before affirming `what should be.'" I am saddened that these authors have acquiesced to the social norm and are suggesting that the church do the same.    These authors suggest divorce rituals in which religious communities gather around the divorcing member or member couple and offer a public and spiritual occasion for "redefining" their relationship. As if divorce isn't easy enough, now the church can simply redefine things.  What kind of message does this send to our youth, as well as to other people who are struggling to keep their marriages together?   They also fall into the trap of defining family as "anything anyone wants to make it."  Yes, this is the "way it is" in society but we will fall into complete familial anarchy if the church abandons what God has established for the family.  They state, "It's a social fact that lesbian and gay couples establish enduring partnerships as stable and long lived as many marriages.  What is most congruent with Gospel values - to ignore such life-giving faithful commitments or to offer recognition, blessing, and the support of the wider Christian family?"    They even give instruction to the church for dealing with cohabitating couples.  They propose that choosing to live together even without a wedding is a commitment and that the church should welcome them as members, but they suggest caution in putting these folks in "role model" positions such as teachers of children or advisors of youth groups; as if one has to be a teacher or advisor to be a role model.  We are all role models, regardless of our position or function in the body.  It may be a new day for family ministry, but it is a sad day for the church if we allow society to define us.      
 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 Barber's analysis ignores important facts in order to prove his thesis about how the primary battle in the world being between the free market and religious fundamentalism. It works, somewhat, but fails to take into account numerous instances where this tension is called into question. Not every zealot in the world is an enemy of technology, as the War in Iraq has shown us. 
 Everything's a conspiracy these days! This book, though, goes FAR beyond  the X-Files paranoia. One simple example of the author's credibility is  evidenced in his 'Chronology' where he cites Jesus as possibly travelling  "...to India, Tibet and Britain to be initiated into the esoteric  traditions of East and West." As often seen in this type of work,  Freemasonry takes most of the blame and the author's bibliography is a  veritable treasure-trove works customarily used by anti-Masons to prove  their point. If you want more to justify worrying about that light in your  refrigerator or those black helos, this is the book to buy 
 This is the third or fourth book I've been working through to try to learn Japanese. I'm still a beginner but I've gotten some of the basics. I've made it as far as lessen 10 in Japanese for Busy People and I'm going to abandon the book and try another volume.  I found the lessens to be unclear and the learning curve VERY steep. (Remember, I've been studying Japanese for some months, I know some of this material already). In my blog I referred to this book as Japanese for People Who Have Lots of Time to Study or Japanese for People Who Remember Everything They Have Ever Read. Maybe it works for other people, but for me and my learning style it was like beating my head against a wall 
 I was disappointed by this book. There is very little valuable content, and that little is stretched and repeated on and on in order to fill more than 200 pages. All together, a boring, badly written, repetitive book 
 It realy is difficult to find words to describe how bad this book is. It starts off with a young lad at University falling for a young girl who is in love with someone else who has gone missing after reading some 'mysterious' book and then the two of them go wandering around Anatolia stealing peoples identites from car wrecks.  Believe me, I havent told you the plot, there isn't one. Orhan Pamuk is one of those unique writers who is blessed with a publisher who promotes his books to the hilt in the West as much as they are in Turkey (they are published in English at the same time they come out in Turkey)that doesn't however mean that they are any good.  Orhan Pamuk has hit upon a winning formular for writing. Write for 2 audiences. One the upper middle class Turk for whom ibn Arabi is an Arab president (sic) and Dante is an Italian footballer (sic) and a Westerner who knows absolutly nothing about Turkey, Islam or the Middle East and why write for these 2 audiences? Because anyone else would see though his books in a minute. His quotes from ibn Arabi and Rumi (which seem to appear in all of his books) are totally out of place, out of context and read like he has just flicked thought a 'dictionary of Middle Eastern Sufis' and found a few quotes. His quotes from Western classics are equally out of place. His plot goes nowhere apart from to boredom and his storyline leaves the reader simply frustrated (as to having wasted so much of his/her time reading such rubbish)  Also notice the fact that 'Milliyet' newspaper appears in all of his books including this one (does he have a contract with this newspaper? 
 I would rate this piece of film trash a "0", but unfortunately, that is not an available option. This stupid movie did not start the scene, but it did contribute to it. This review is to all of you ghetto monkey morons who think that because you have ground effects and an obnoxious sounding muffler, that somehow you have transformed yourselves into Mario Andretti and a Ferrari; I have some astounding news for you, the average citizen thinks you are an idiot with a license, and should be barred from ever contributing to the human populus. No one is impressed with your driving antics that endanger the rest of us on the roads and highways. In fact, everytime I read that one of you idiots died in a tragic accident due to your own ignorance and lack of driving skills, I actually celebrate with my friends, and we relieve ourselves on the grave, because there is one less stupid person on the road. Do the rest of the world a favor, save your money, don't make your car look stupid and ghetto, which in return, makes you look stupid and ghetto,learn how to drive safely, turn your hat around (facing forward), pick up your retarded looking baggy pants, put a belt on, and hide your underwear, (that no one wants to see, but laughs at you while you walk past) and speak a normal language that includes words besides "dawg" and other non-understandable neanderthal sounds that clearly indicate your lack of education and stupidity 
 I wish they'd pull this one from the market. I've never heard a soul say anything good about it. It's just out there so Patterson fans will accidentally buy it. DON'T BUY IT!! It is nowhere near the quality of any of his other books! Get ANYTHING else by Patterson and it will be better than this 
 I usually like off-beat and stange books. But I just didn't enjoy this one much. First let me say this book is EXTREMELY short. Its listed at 92 pages but several of those are adds and other filler. It also has illustrations and HUGE type. I honestly think with a normal type setting this would be about a 10 page short story. I read it in 20 minutes.   Its very original and strange, which is good. But I didn't find it humorous other than the joke of the title itself. After you get over the shock of two people sticking the baby Jesus where the sun don't shine the joke wears thin.   I guess its worth buying if you don't mind paying 10 bucks for such a short book. 
 Rairly have I read a book that I hate.  This is it!  Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room.  Tony's fan base just lost one 
 The first X-Men movie was fantastic. The second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better. This third movie was absolute trash and I will never buy it 
 Welcome to Bucharest where Zachary (David Gunn) the vampire killer has come to hunt the creatures that turned the woman he loved into a monster he had no choice but kill.  This time his objective is Ash (Jonathan Morris), a master vampire who maintains his tribe in the secret Bucharest underground while operating a very high toned nightclub as a lure for new 'blood.'  What Zachary doesn't count on is his attraction for Sofia (Kirsten Cerre), a beautiful American pianist who has come to Bucharest to perform and who has become the object of Ash's desires.  Not only must Ash deal with Zachary's attempts to destroy his nest and reclaim Sofia, he has political problems among his own vampire servants.    Welcome to a film where everyone speaks as if they used to have a Romanian accents and only saw the scripts a week ago.  The is a kind of heavy handed lack of emotionality about this film as vampires announce their intent to destroy each other with almost no inflection in their voices.    While this is a pretty film to watch, with lots of midnight scenes of Bucharest, the moodiness of the cinematography and the score are not matched by the acting.  Obligatory scenes with fake blood and frontal nudity give the work a sense of awkwardness that Director Ted Nicolaou never quite manages to overcome 
 The music on this anthology disk is very bad.   You have to "want" to like the Germs. You must have alternative motives. Your mind must already be set before you press "Play" for the first time. Maybe somebody cool that you know liked the Germs or maybe they were name dropped in a magazine you like or that guy from the Offspring wearing his blue circle logo Germs T-shirt is burned deep in your psyche... maybe you just like the name "Germs"? It is a cool name for a band and they do have a cool minimalist logo.  If you were to first encounter this music blindfolded wearing headphones and without any knowledge that this music is the Germs, you would likely rip off the headphones, take a couple asprin and run for the hills.  Why? because this music is just plain BAD 
 If your looking for detailed guidance on some of the problems of diabetics you want find it here. Was this written by people knowledgable in the field? Examples: If a antibiotic salve takes more  than a few days to work call your doctor; slow healing is directly related to poor blood sugar control. Otherwise all cursory stuff you might find in pamphlets at the doctor's office 
 I can't understand how this book won the World Fantasy Award.  Touted as "horror", it was barely scary.  Lieber filled his book with a string of impossible coincidences, then pulled a rabbit out of his hat at the end.  Avoid 
 I have read "Open House" and enjoyed it but this was very disappointing. Not only did I not identify with Betta - I actually disliked her, and like many other reviewers I found most of her actions completely implausible - a 55 year old woman renting a room in a house with two 20-year-olds for occasions when she was scared to sleep at home?  They must have been laughing at her behind her back!  There were so many storylines started that never went anywhere - for example the love story behind the letters written to the old lady during the war.  
 (2.5 Stars) When I first began reading WH, I was turned around a bit on the chracters as well some language styles, so I decided to cheat and check out the list of characters that was in the back. I soon realized how unhelpful it was and very disappointed by its lack of contributing nothing more than the obvious. What I mean is, instead of helping me deciphor who was who and in relation to one antoher, in which a geneology would have been better, they merely gave very short snippets of description that was actually in the text itself. I got through all the relations by my friend who supplied me with a genology chart.  There were also endnotes that state the obvious as well and it was very tedious to have to keep flipping back to see if they would clarify anything. One character speaks in special Englilsh dialect that was difficult to read and understand. The author suggests that you just need to read it aloud and you'll understand it. Granted, that's true, but a translation in the endnotes would have been nice too.   There is a timeline at the beginning, which is nice but I'm not sure what the point of it was and it seemed randomly placed. At the back again, there is a short discussion on the motifs/themes of the book. It was somewhat enlightening but they point out things the reader would have picked up anyway. But, one thing that was really interesting was that there was a short essay on how the book was received from Bronte's time as well into modern times. The short bio at the beginning was done well though.  The overall language of the book was modernized while still keeping certain dialec and stylistic elements of Bronte that didn't really work well. It was very awkward at times but nevertheless, very readable.   Someone who wants a less intimidating introduction to Bronte or any classical works will find this book helpful (& others in this series). But for those of you who are used to a more strict classical interpretation with a more academic flavor, this is NOT the book for you. You will find it somewhat dull, unchallenging and tedious. The language is not very sophisticated nor reminiscent of the linguistic era (which I enjoy, you may not, so...)  The STORY of WH was fascinating. I both hated it and loved it. There were times when I just wanted to chuck the book across the room because I found it SO vile, the charcters so enraged and violent, selfish and horrible. I haven't feld that way since I read Ann Rice's 'Memnoch the Devil'. I've never read a more passionate and fierceer book; and while I read, I was both dreading it yet couldn't wait to see what happened.   I read this several days ago and I'm still buzzing from it. The confusion of the names is a very interesting device, clever and sly. Bronte was ahead of her time, fusing both the gothic novel with supernatural, dramatic and tragic styles. The evolution of 3 generations was so complex yet the progression of each was so vivid and stand out on their own. I haven't decided if I hate or love Heathcliff and Catherine, if even I can forgive them for their nature. And the wonderful way that Bronte wrote was not just the language of words but in the way she used the wilderness of the moors as a description of their wild selves.  
 Attention: Seasoned RealEstate investers don't waste your time purchasing this book. Ideal for amatuer investors who want to add more value to their piece of real estate. 
 I found myself reaching to answer these questions, in the spirit of being cooperative....almost making mountains out of molehills as I viewed my life 
 I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD. 
 Barbie can't sing,come on all the songs sound so bad with that voice,atleast put the real voice so it would sound better. 
 The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others 
 hard to follow Jack's writing..the effort puts me to sleep.  Good read if you have insomnia, I guess 
 Not suprising liberals come up with this in order to try and silence some of the rare good Americans we have to speak out in true support of our great country. The author even uses "HATE" blatently, which only shows how blind the twisted perspective is. I know the conservatives like Savage and Coulter are definitely not liars and actually have the right plan America needs for adequate terrorist protection. Its also funny, Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh etc do not actually hate mentally ill liberals like author Clint Willis hates what he doesnt agree with,  but they are actually trying to help and change why exactly these people(extreme left) act in this suicidal, destructive and absolutly antiAmerican way of thinking.  
 I was very disappointed with this book.  It had a few basic steps, but they were limited and the designs offered were not ones I would ever make for me or friends.  The best part of the book was the first chapter on materials and tools.  There are better beginning books (Bead on a wire) with more tips and design ideas than this.  I sent mine back 
 i would review it if i got it. come on guys. i placed the order on 1/6/06. 
 I have never read such bull**** in my life.  As an educator with her recent Masters in Education, I debunk Greene's theories.  I suggest reading actual research done by Phd's and educators such as: A.R. Sadovnik; H. Kohl; R.P. McDermott; J. Bettie, M.A. Gibson; M. Polluck; Fine, Weis, & Powell; R. Rist; J. O'Neil .....to name a few.    When Jay Greene has read from all of the experts above, spent a few years in schools doing the work of an innovative, caring, open-minded teacher, and interviewed students from underpriviledged back grounds, then he can write a book about schools. Our students are not sick patients and our schools are not hospitals, yet Greene sticks to this metaphor in order to make his reader's think that education is something as simple as a broken toy.  In fact, education is about teaching our children to become critical thinkers: something Greene does not want his readers to do.   
 This book could be fun to read if readers do not question anything, however, for the countless analytical minds who critique:    The author, Gaddis, is so caught up in his little world that he fails to understand or consider the obvious, and there are too many examples of this.  The book begins with the chapter titled "A morning at Yale" where somehow, I get the immpression Gaddis can't stop talking about how he teaches at Yale university, and his Yale collegues who are so great, blah, blah, blah.   Somewhere in the middle of the second chapter, Gaddis gets over the peak of his ego (it climaxes again later in the book), and starts throwing out historical facts along with answering his own questions that he falsely labels as "America's" questions.  Many of his exclamations are written is such a ridiculous pseudo-intellectual manner (along with the unsystematic reasoning that is applied) and it is annoying how he can't stop telling the reader how they feel or what they think, by INEXCUSABLY generalizing.  The book ends with a chapter titled "An evening at Yale", which should be retitled to "An evening on Uranus" to match how far our of reality this professor seems to be ; )  If you have to buy this book, then buy it used, because I would hate to see another dime added to what seems like another pompus professor, caught up in his own self-glorifying world.     
 My daughter and I had listened to the first two audio books, "The Bad Beginning" and "The Reptile Room", both narrated by Tim Curry, so we were very disappointed by "The Wide Room." Tim Curry was a fabulous narrator, why did they not continue to use him? His voice has just the right quality of evil mischief to it, and as an actor he really brought the book to life. Often, the person who wrote the book is not the best person to read it and this is the case with Lemony Snicket. His whiney, lispy voice was so bad it was a distraction. Curry's fabulous, velvety voice oozed malice and delight and the loss of him was a loss to the quality of the story. Lemony Snicket narrating his own story is truly an "Unfortunate Event! 
 i order those shoes because they matched the dress perfectly, then the shoes arrived, they were brown. nothing like the picture on the site 
 Completely disappointed. No soul, no tradition. Save your money unless you're into UB40 and synthesized reggae...ugh. It is all to obvious why there are no samples of this CD on the web page. I took one for the team...buyer beware. SUPPORT LOCAL MUSIC 
 I am a big fan of Dick's. His short stories are his strength, his imagination is superb, but this novel is peculiar to say the very least. I am well aware that a major criticism of his body of work is the uneven writing. Sometimes he soars, but at other times it feels as though he wrote a book in a week and stuffed it in an envelope and mailed it off to the publisher without giving it another thought. This is just such a book. How it won the John W. Campbell Memorial award for the best novel of 1974 is beyond me. It would never get published today.  The beginning is classic Dick: a famous man wakes up in  a flophouse after a murder attempt on his life and finds that he doesn't exist. No records, no biography, fame all gone, a pocket full of money, that's it. But from that point on the story lumbers from one encounter with a ditzy woman to another. It's all rambling filler that has nothing to do with the story. The policeman in the title doesn't show up until halfway through. Granted, the story picks up a bit at that point, but then it loses its focus again and the ending is a rush job if ever there was one. The whole thing turns out to be a drug induced figment of his imagination. How disappointing is that? That's as bad as  those Star Trek time travel episodes where everyone goes through absolute hell, they should all be traumatized for life and suffer from terminal PTSD, but then the loop is completed and it's as though none of it ever happened. Arghhh!   If you think Dick was one of the great Sci-Fi masters of all time, read this book, but keep it in context with his corpus of work (i.e. somewhere in the bottom half). If you are just starting to read Dick, skip this one for a while. But by all means read his short stories. Some of them are keepers for all time.  
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 Barely literate grammar and sloppy copy editing match this book's thin content. The book ignores masters of the genre, presents formulae for doing what everybody's doing. Some of the interviews contain useful hints, but  nothing to justify purchasing or reading the book. Shame on the publisher 
 This tripe was horrible. The only reason i gave it 1 star is because of the bus wreck that was very gory. Besides that, and when the boy scout zombies attack, I fast forwarded thru the entire movie. Even the nudity was horrible. If all other movies on earth are destroyed and TV is abolished, you should STILL not watch this film!!!! 
 This is proof positive that the  vast right-wing conspiracy is alive and well today!  Tyrrell vomits his vitriolic, vituperative diatribe. over 235 pages of utter hate for a man whose derriere he doesn't deserve to be a pimple upon!   
 I was drawn to this book by the promise of experiencing or gaining familiarity with a new part of Paris, a city I have visited often.  The book fell far short of that.  It left me disappointed and longing for what I had missed.  It was difficult to connect with or enter into the story primarily  because the author failed to portray a personal intimacy with the subject. As an example, she tells us that moving within Paris was a bigger event than imagined but the description lacked emotional depth. Where were her feelings, little experiences, failings, successes, reactions. Overall, the author proved she has knowledge but does not know how to share it.   
 DO NOT buy the case Canon sells for this camera. It takes 20 seconds to take the camera out or put it in 
 Boring!! I was disappointed.  In fact, I disliked it so much, I only finished about 3/4 of the book.  That is very uncommon for me as I alway push through as I want to give the author a chance to turn it around.  I just could not do it with this book 
 I would give this book a zero, if it were possible...  Anyone that wants to follow this book is more than likely screwing up their child. I would consider "Doctor" Ezzo's philosophy a form of child abuse. This thing is the most awful, upsetting piece of parenting literature I've ever read!!!!!!!!!!! I don't understand, WHY would parents not want to go to your baby at night when he is crying?  WHAT is wrong with loving your baby, cuddles, and attending to their needs???  Oh, yeah I forgot....American parenting seems to given way to the form of training your baby like a puppy, fitting "convieniently" into your lives, with alot of distance, no empathy, No trust, little to no communication, little emotional bonding, and in the future, this results in children who have attachment problems in later life, trouble regarding relationships, and practically seem to be teaching them to be independent and self sufficient from the time they are brought home from the hospital....  How heartbreaking.   Sorry, I don't beleive in the form of abuse as this book is about. and I wish more parents felt the same as I do. 
 I was very gung ho when I found out that Disney was finally releasing the Davy Crockett TV show on DVD.  I grew up watching the two Davy Crockett movies.  HOwever upon actually seeing these DVDs I was very disappointed.  It is exactly the same as those two movies it is just split into five seperate episodes.  The Episodes: Davy Crockett, Indian Fighter; Davy Crockett Goes to Congress; and Davy Crockett at the Alamo are all the parts included in the movie Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier.  The episodes Davy Crockett's Keelboat Race; Davy Crockett and the River Pirates; were what made up the movie Davy Crockett and the River Pirates.  I for one am planning on buying the newer version that came out in 2004 that is just the two movies on one disc.  The only difference between this set and the new set is that there are couple of features on this set and that there are introductions to the episodes buy Leonard Maltin and it has two discs in a tin collector's box.  The biggest difference of all is that this set runs from between $37-$100 whereas you can buy the two movies on DVD for $14-$16.  I myself will go for the cheaper movie set rather than have to watch each episode sperately.   
  In this book there is a kid named Vince Luca. He is a high school student whose life is different than anyone else's. His dad is a mob boss, making his life really weird. Vince's dad is constantly interfering with his dating life. Vince's brother also works in the mob with his father. When his brother and his dad try to help him with his dating things go horribly wrong. Then he meets a girl he really likes, but he can tell his family about it because her father works for the FBI. Her dad has been trying to put Vince's dad in jail for years.  I dislike the title of this book. It is very misleading. When I picked up this book I thought it was going to be filled with action and cool things, but in reality it is a book about dating.  I think a girl would like this book. I has a lot of dating things in it. 
 I read this after enjoying Iles' "Footprints of God" quite a bit.  This is his first work and thank goodness he has since learned to be more concise.  The book is lengthy, and repeats itself quite a bit (due, I assume to the length and complexity of the plot and characters).  Several characters could've been cut out entirely - they were in long enough to kill and be killed, but didn't add anything to the story.  Intriguing characters, too - he could've saved them for their own stories.  After wanting to get to the end for the last 200 pages, I found the ending itself rushed.  All loose ends were wrapped up very conveniently and in ways that didn't pay off for the investment of time required to get that far.  There were some aggravating teases, too.  When the Israeli finally gets to confront the Nazi for the question of "why?" (regarding the anti-semitism), I was really hoping that Iles would've ventured a reply - anything to try and give the Nazi character some depth or plausibility other than just pure hate for the sake of hate.  Nope - he put the question out there and didn't try to answer it.  That's what I was hoping for - replace some of the graphic violence with real explorations of the underlying themes and how this fanaticism really survives - not just giving example after example of how it's manifested.  All that being said, the last page of the epilogue is brilliant, and in it, I found a simple yet profound statement that struck a chord. 
 Bill O'Reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from Twilight Zone. His vision reminds me of "Manhunter"-- the Michael Mann film not the lame book he based it on. O'Reilly, tall and deformed, is the Tooth-Fairy. O'Reilly is gutter-trash 
 I have been reading the Navajo mysteries for the first time, in chronological order. I was sad when each ended, and could barely wait to get the next one from the library...until this one. The plot is convoluted and far fetched with a LOT of holes, and I found the setting ugly and depressing, especially the character of the hit man. (This is the second hit man Hillerman's given us who owes it all to his unhealthy attachment to a disfunctional mama.  Hmmmm...)  I skimmed the last 4 chapters because I was tired of both the book and the setting...I just wanted it to see how it ended and be done with it because I was not enjoying the experience as I usually do.  So as other reviewers have advised: don't start here 
 My 60s something father gave me this book. I am a 45-year-old middle-class man with a 6-year-old son using my wife's account. I don't understand for whom this book is written. It is full of painfully obvious advice such as "Don't play with your food" or "Do not throw golf clubs... in anger." Anyone raised in America (presuming that is the author's intended audience) who doesn't already understand these things and take them to heart isn't going to be interested in reading about them in a book, if they can even read. Chapter 15 deals with Staring and differences where the author admonishes: "Do not repeat racist, sexist or ethnic jokes or tolerate them in your presence." If you were not a racist you would obviously already understand and agree with this. If you are, this book isn't going to change your attitude and you would probably want to burn it. I found this book useless for any reasonably sophisticated person unless you happen to be from a third world country or another planet. If the book was intended to teach good manners to the unsophisticated, dream on! I think the author has a Professor Henry Higgins Jones. I am also concerned about my father's opinion of me, I mean "Do not expect a child to endure a lengthy shopping trip unless it is to a toy or candy store." Duh 
 I bought five of these units about six months ago and used each as a timer to prevent my cordless phones from overcharging.  I have five Panasonic cordless phones stationed throughout the house and they really only need to charge about 3 hours per day, rather than 24 hours per day.  Six months later, not one -- not one -- of them is still working.  They all died within a few months of use.  This is junk.  Don't buy it 
 Johnson presents seven "edicts" for fixing education - an appropriate choice of words since she offers little/no justification for them. Let's take a look at some of them -  1)No classroom shall have more than 20 students. Sounds so easy, intuitively makes so much sense. Except it doesn't work. Most research supporting smaller classes is based on confounding expenditures with parental socio-economic class. High socio-economic parents both contribute better genes and home environments to their children; they also typically spend more on education (especially for reduced class size). Thus, simplistic analyses conclude (somehow) that reduced class size is "the cure." More sophisticated analyses, demonstrated by Hanushek, Coleman, and others, is that WHEN PARENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE HELD CONSTANT reduced class size contributes very little if anything to improving pupil outcomes.  Other facts suggest the same conclusion, and don't require sophisticated analyses: a)Asian children almost always outscore Americans - despite much larger classes. b)Jewish and Asian children in America score much higher than other groups. c)Thirty years of decreasing class size, etc. has accomplished NOTHING - National Assessment of Educational Progress results for 17-year-olds have been essentially unchanged, as have dropout rates. d)There is more variation in pupil achievement WITHIN SCHOOLS THAN BETWEEN THEM - thus, school factors cannot possibly dominate pupil outcomes.  4)Begin to deflate the bureaucratic bloat. Absolutely correct. However, her methodology is silly - eg. try a week w/o the Supt. and if things are still running smoothly get rid of him/her. Any competent Supt. will create an organization that can survive w/o him/her for a week. The real problem is in middle-management - consultants, coordinators, supervisors for everything under the sun. Get rid of all of them, except perhaps in the largest districts. They simply diffuse responsibility, add costs, and reduce teachers' achievement motivation.  7)Stop the testing frenzy. Cease the accountability testing of licensed teachers. Really - experts on Japanese education success attribute much of it to "high-stakes testing." How else does one evaluate teachers, curricula, etc.?   Reality is that parents are the prime determinants of pupil success. They need to take charge of their children, and stop thinking this role can be delegated. 
 Be careful - this is only the student's solutions manual and NOT the textbook.  
 Batman Begins is soooo much better than this or any other of the batman movies. Nicholson SUCKED as the Joker. Joker is a comedian who had an accident trying to pull a robbery to help his pregnant wife. HE IS NOT A GANGSTER OR THE ONE WHO KILLED BATMAN'S PARENTS!!!! HE IS A PSYCHO AND BATMAN'S NEMESIS!!! YOU CAN'T KILL HIM OFF!!! HOW STUPID IS THAT?!!! Who came up with that one. Keaton is a sissy, Christian Bale could beat him down!!! Keaton DID NOT have the physical prescence to play Batman. All in all, a joke of a comic movie..But it is better than Daredevil!!!!:- 
 The first part of the book tells a story that wasn't riveting but was holding my attention as bedside reading.  Then the author, a former Deputy Sheriff in Possum Trot NM, decides to detour into an international thriller for no descernable reason.  The author is completely out of his depth when he leaves Hog Wallor NM. The hero's wife is a LTC in the army MP's. The author quickly shows he has no idea what he is writing about.  The wife is headed for a "plum assignment" as Asst MILATT in Ankara.  Maybe in Roadrunner Villas NM that sounds good.  In the actual US Army such a job would be a kiss of death for an MP officer, not a road to eagles or stars.  The wife gets a Dip passport and heads to Ireland.  Apparently the Vice Chief of Staff keeps a few in his desk just in case.  There is no word about actually applying for the passport, it just magically appears when needed. Getting a Dip Visa isn't even mentioned, I doubt the author knows what one is.  I don't think an MP 0-5 would rate a Dip passport in any event.  Without visting or even calling the embassy the spunky lady goes about her business with a senior Irish police inspector who is at her beck and call.  A phone call from him solves most of her problems. He apparently has nothing else to do.  It's magic.  I doubt that the Irish police would make this LTC's investigation such a priority, they are helpful to foreign law enforcement but not lapdogs waiting around for their next chance to help foreigners.  The pluckly LTC waves her Dip passport and strolls thru security at the airport.  Maybe you think that's the way things work back in Wide Place In The Road NM, but they don't most places.  I travel with a Dip passport and when I travel I go thru security like everyone else.  In 09/06 I non-pro'ed a dip pouch back from Africa through Europe.  The small hand carried pouch didn't go thru security but I did. Did word of 9/11 reach the sheriff's dept in Bent Knuckle NM??  Finally the Marine assigned to the DEFATT in Dublin shows up with the embassy RSO at the pluckly gal's hotel room.  Our author calls the Marine the Asst MILATT.  No you pinhead since 1775 the Marines have been part of the Naval Service.  He would be Asst Naval Attache (I doubt that Dublin's 8 ship navy rates an Asst to keep track of it, but what's common sense to our author).  Oh as the cherry on top the real evil menance is a NeoCon in the current adminsitration.  Yes the author doesn't know much about anything except pulling drivers over on state highway 37 but he knows how to kiss the [...] of any hollywood type who might be looking for an awful story to turn into a movie. Then the story moves back to New Mexico and hurries to a conslusion like the author's hair is on fire.  It didn't make sense but that is OK, I was just happy the thing was ending at that point. 
 I consider myself a huge pixar fan. This is easily the most insipid Pixar movie ever. Pixar ran out of pixie dust while making this one. I have read the rave reviews and am scratching my head trying to figure what it was that they like about this movie. Pixar, if you are listening, please, please, dont embarass yourself by dishing out this sort of c-grade stuff. I expect more from you 
 Really, I hate to use such an overused phrase as the title for my review, but coming up with something clever is really more than this book deserves. You'd think it'd be a safe bet that a book written by people you find funny and endorsed on the back cover by people you find hilarious is going to be a hoot. You'd think that, but you'd be wrong. Instead you'd be left saying, "Jon Stewart, my man, you liked this? Seriously? Are you high? No, wait don't answer that, it's all becoming abundantly clear to me now." 
 Patient records are privileged; Dr. Orne justifies releasing tapes of Anne Sexton's therapy because the daughter of A.S. approved. He wrote the preface to the book, displaying a rather passive attitude to the  malfeasance of the therapist who slept with A.S.     And does the  end--understanding creativity/a poet's life and death--justify the means?   Do outpourings in therapy tell readers about where creativity comes from,  how it is shaped,  the interplay of life and art?  I doubt it.  People  "edit" their therapy talk, too, though differently from their  public utterings.  Readers may be seduced by these secrets, hoping to find  answers that cannot be given, even--maybe especially--by therapists.     I  think the biographer overplays her hand, and might have done a better book  without the controversial tapes 
 I think this book was probably very helpful a couple years ago. And there's still some good information here. But the web is changing so fast that a lot of their guidelines and "patterns" just don't apply (i.e. they encourage you to use popup windows).  Wait until they revise the book before you spend the dough. Oh, and the website they refer you to for updates is an embarrasment 
 I don't know what is happening with authors these days, but with each book they seem to get worse and Catherine Coulter is following trend. Ms. Coulter's early works such as "The Legacy Trilogy", "The Magic Trilogy" were really good, but "Pengragon"  was very bad. I didn't realy care about the either of the main characters and the only reason that read the book was the fact that I spent over eight dollars for it. Maybe Ms. Coulter and others should take a break and take the time to write a book that is worth its money 
 Fresh Horses, on paper, would have seemed to have been a perfect hit script. You had Molly Ringwald, with her porcelain skin and delicately curly red-blonde hair. You had Andrew McCarthy with his boyish charm but also the male strength beginning to come through. You had a romantic triangle. You had the "class divide". The Brat Pack was loved by millions. How could this fail?   The problem really does seem to come down to the actors themselves. There's very little "energy" at all to this story which is supposedly about passion overcoming logic. Molly is a 16 yr old girl in rural Kentucky. When her stepfather begins fondling her, and her mother does little to help, Molly tries for the only escape she can find - marrying the older bad-man-in-town, Viggo Mortensen. She claims she never slept with Viggo - only used him for escape. Then Viggo's father began fondling her, and now she wants out of this house as well.   To get momentary relief from her homelife, she hangs out at a friend's home, which is a 24 hour party. Here she runs into Andrew. Andrew is a very serious student who has just gotten engaged to his high-class, wealthy girlfriend. The girlfriend rambles on and on about china patterns, having children and living the perfect life. Andrew goes with the flow until he sees Molly - and is instantly in lust. Molly leads him to believe she's 20, single, and interested in him. It takes maybe 3 days before he's sleeping with her. To his credit, he does tell his fiancee promptly, and breaks off the engagement.   You'd think everything was wonderful now, right? However, Andrew learns from friends about Molly's lies. He decides to keep seeing her anyway. However, he doesn't want to introduce her to his family, and has no intention of marrying her. He says he loves her - but his feelings seem to be more related to sex. At one point he even gives her a wad of cash to buy her off.   There's a telling scene near the end when Andrew thinks Molly has been publicly stripped by her husband. Andrew storms off to their house to have a talk with Viggo. Andrew is deliberately rude - laughing at Viggo's artwork and putting him down. But it's Viggo who is the calm one here. When Molly shows up, Viggo points out that Molly's been doing all this lying and scheming so that Andrew would be a Knight in Shining Armor and ride off with her. He asks Andrew - if you're saying I'm not good enough for her - it seems that you think you're too good for her, right? Andrew finds himself agreeing - that he won't take on Molly himself. He wants to get Molly away from Viggo, but then is going to abandon her to her own means. How could he figure that Molly would be better off with nobody at all, vs with Viggo?   Fast forward to a year later, and Molly has in fact found herself a "wealthy college boy" to take care of her and is taking classes again. She's happy, and Andrew is sad. I suppose you have to give them credit for a not-typical Hollywood ending to the story.   The landscapes are often gorgeous, and the various details of high class, low class, city, country are all played nicely against each other. So the problem really comes down to the main actors. Molly and Andrew maybe have gotten too used to playing ensemble roles where each person just has to be a stereotype without a lot of depth. You really get a sense of shallowness when you're watching this movie. Andrew has an entire life including a long-term romance, that he's set in. In just 3 days he's thrown it all away for Molly - but you never get any real sense that he cares about her. Molly was supposedly taking some quite desperate steps to find safety in her life - including seducing and lying to Andrew in order to convince him to rescue her - but she never seems to care much either.   Intriguingly, only 2 people really seem to have depth in this movie. One is Ben Stiller, Andrew's best friend. It's ironic because Ben's character IS shallow and cares more for himself than for those around him. Even so, Ben really seems authentic as someone who isn't used to having to worry about others - but who really does try his best, many times, to get Andrew to wake up to reality. The other is Viggo Mortensen. You only glimpse Viggo once until the end of the movie - he's just referred to as a "rough guy" who has done many bad things. When you actually encounter Viggo (after Andrew has in essence broken into his house to confront him) you're prepared for the worst. However, Viggo is very patient, very well spoken, and quite intelligent in his commentary. He doesn't thrash Andrew for sleeping with his wife. Instead, he lays out the situation and makes both Andrew and Molly face their failings. Molly deliberately lied and used Andrew as a tool of getting a better life. Andrew, for his part, knew he'd never actually rescue Molly but led her on repeatedly to have time with her.   Some have said this is the worst movie ever. Many sections of it can be very painful to watch. However, I do find glimmers of meaning - especially in the ending discussion with Viggo. Even there, though, you would think this would be a moment of great soul searching for Andrew and Molly. Instead, both seem to think, "Yeah, I guess that's true. Oh well, see ya." I don't mind gloomy movies at all - in fact I really appreciate them sometimes. However, if a movie has no depth of character or quality acting, it just makes the whole experience fall flat. 
 i bought this book thinking it was the actual text book, but it was really just the study guide. i had to go out and buy the real book from school for 100$. 
 The rafter jig idea was great, but there just wasn't enough info and detail to actually build it (I thought).  I must admit, I'am not a pro as this book "by pros for pros" claims, but I guess if I was a pro, then I would probably find the information in this book to be too elementary.  This book is ok for learning roof basics, but it's not enough info and detail to fully learn all that's involved with building roofs 
 I read "Gettysburg".  I listened to "Grant Comes East", an unabridged version on tape.  I enjoyed the first.  On a positive note, I got so excited during the Confederate attack on Washington that I almost wrecked my car.  But.  The alternate plot of Gettysburg is feasible but the farther time passes from July 1st, the more difficult it is to accept the authors' projection of alternate history.  The idea of moving the Army of the Tennessee to Pennsylvania and putting them into almost immediate offensive action is asserting a near impossibility.  That Army was virtually inactive, under Grant and Sherman, from July until the battles around Chattanooga in November.  They were as exhausted by victory as Pemberton's men were by defeat.  The rescue of Washington by the 54th Massachussets is a tip of the hat to political correctness.  The authors portray them as battle-hardened veterans.  As of that time (prior to their assault on Ft. Wagner), the unit had no combat experience.  Except for his raid into "the hollow shell" of the Confederacy, Col. Grierson's career had been unremarkable.  It is difficult to believe that his men could have been transported to Pennsylvania, mounted on new, unfamiliar horses, and been a match for Wade Hampton.  I don't plan to read the third book of the trilogy.  My son began reading it and was so turned off that he didn't finish it.  This could have been a great series but I think that Newt (whom I admire as a political strategist) lost his courage about half way through Grant Comes East and stopped pursuing his Confederate victory at Gettysburg to its logical conclusion 
 Lindsay Moran's foray into the publishing world is as unsatisfying as her love life.   First, the positive aspects of the book: Moran really was a case officer in the CIA, at a crucial point in the agency's history (immediately pre and post 9/11). Many of the books now available about the CIA inner-workings were written during the Cold War, and now are obsolete to the modern day reader.  As someone interested in applying to the agency, the book has value in that it prepares one for some of the hardships of Clandestine life. You learn that there are some real downsides to the life of a case officer. You learn how pervasive the agency controls your life. You learn the extent of training.  Lindsay Moran as an author is pompous, over-confident, and border-line delusional. She seems very insecure about many things; her ethnic heritage, her weight, her looks, her personality, and most of all, her marital status. I do not think I've ever come across a writer who so absolutely requires male companionship in order to validate who they are. Moran's incessant references to her "Harvard education" reveal her insecurity about her own intellect; she finds it necessary to constantly remind the reader of her Ivy league education. While she insults other CIA recruits for their desire to succeed, she simultaneously reveals her never-ending attempts to soar to the top of the class. She is the type of person that, on the surface, pretends not to try, and yet spends every waking moment desperately attempting to succeed. Her hypocrisy is sickening.  Moran's writing style is extremely obnoxious. The writing appears as if she sat down in front of a computer with a dictionary and thesarus and attempted to use the most obscure and inappropriate descriptive words possible. Simply put, she is terrible at describing localities, people, and herself.   Her relationship with men is the most disturbing part of all. She constantly launches verbal assaults against the men in her life. At the same time, she never stops whining about how she wants a boyfriend, a husband. Her double standards smack of a weak and conflicted person.  I also suspect that Moran embellished many of her encounters with CIA personnel, in order to make herself appear in a better light.   In my opinion, Lindsay Moran is a terrible author who had no business getting a book published. The only reason she was able to get this book printed was because of her experience at the CIA. And yet she does nothing but trash the very place that makes the book possible. Moran clearly never possessed the strength of will and commitment necessary for a covert operative. I suspect that she took the job because she secretly wanted her family, her friends, and others, to know that she was a CIA case officer, and for them to be endlessly impressed with her job. The CIA requires individuals who are not glory-whores like Moran. She should have never walked through that door.   Overall, read the book if you are thinking about a career as a case officer. In spite of her second-rate writing ability, Moran does provide an insider's view of the agency. However, I would not let Moran's pessimistic attitude and self-righteous, know-it-all demeanor sour you on the agency. Read other books as well in order to balance out this poor excuse for a published work 
 this cd sees the crr's change direction. they've changed so much they no longer sound like the same group. this has a lot to do with the departure of daniel wylie. when he left the group, the band were left with inferior songwriting and now lack direction. they sound like third grade u2 and that's no lie. not even one song on this cd can save it. i'll give 'emptiness' pass marks but only because it's best in very bad company. if you expect to hear the same sound as the classic 'enjoy the melodic sunshine', you will be major disappointed. this record can't hold a candle to 'enjoy'. so it's major, major, disappointment 
 Dont take me wrong I do love Mariah but this movie is not making any sense to me I mean Mariah doesnt seem very interest to "play" in this movie!!! This movie is all about music music music music music repeating over and over again nothing new nothing has been changed... come on!!! but then Mariah seem to be better in another movie called Wisegirls but again I honestly dont think that Mariah should be an actress herself I mean I think she is better off to be a singer instead of playing movies. Wisegirls she seem like she wanted to have the "attention" and "show-off" like saying in her mind: "Look at me I am in the movie!" I honestly deep in my heart she dont need to be playing in any movies unless she stands up and do her "work" with her actions in the movies not like this and Wisegirls movies. I feel bad for giving this movie a 1 star but I had to say what's my opinion about this movie anyways. Wisegirls was alittle better than this one! 
 There are a lot of areas that home inspectors need to know that are not mentioned. If you know nothing about inspections then you could learn a few pointers from this book. If you have some knowledge already then there are other books that would be a much better choice than this one. Some areas in the book were wrong. I would read the other books in this field before buying this one 
 I have been reading the Anita books and loved it ever since Guilty Pleasures. That is why I'm thoroughly disappointed with this book. I'm halfway through the book already and still there's not even a hint of a big bad. After the scene at the club, it's like 200 pages of repetative sex scene nonsense. I found myself glossing through paragraphs just to get to the end of the chapter. It feels like LKH ran out of things to write and stretched a scene into 5 chapters. I mean the curing Gregory part was just wayyyyyy tooooooo loooonnngggg... If the remaining books are like this, I think I'm going to pass it. AND Anita is getting to be so annoying. Whatever happened to her raising the dead or her police work or hell does she even works at her office anymore 
 What type of biographer gets the birthdate of his subject wrong? Roger Morris's angle on the Clintons was pretty obvious in the opening pages. The tale we were in for was one of compromised values, and unvarnished ambition  without any real ideals. I find the Clintons interesting, even fascinating.  I am not an apologist or even a fan;  I've read books that have both  praised and pilloried them. And certainly, every biographer is entitled to  their own point of view. But I lose all respect when I come across errors,  especially ones so obvious as that which appeared on page 109.  Morris  states that in January 1947 Dorothy Rodham gave birth to a good natured  baby girl. Anyone who has followed the Clintons -- least of all a  biographer who spent over 3 years studying his subjects -- knows that  Hillary Rodham Clinton was born on October 26th, 1947.   That's where I put  the book down, feeling a bit had.  After all, any biographer who could be  so carelessly cavalier with such a basic fact would have no problem bending  impressions, quotes, etc to make his case. Inexcusable. Speaks volumes  about the author, and about the sorry state of publishing right now.   ellenpward@aol.co 
 I ordered this product on September 5th.. and its October 10th today. I am still waiting.. This is so agonizing.. I called Amazon Customer Service and they said its not available from the seller..

They have changed the estimated shipping date once and that too only after I called.. Today is the last day for the est. shipping date.. And I am sure they are gonna change it again.. This is pathetic.. The WORST EXPERIENCE I ever had with Amazon.. Be aware of the long wait before ordering this item!!! 
 It wasn't worth the money that I payed for. It is a good radio if you have an external antenna. I would play it in the office and could never get a decent signal until I had to pay an extra $30 for an antenna. If you are going to pay $300 plus you should get something that works out of the box. I could have purchased a lesser know brand and recieved better reception then what I got.

There are plenty of products that don't cost as much and deliver everthing this did and more. 
 This book is a very general view from a very British perspective.  I don't think it belongs in Embry-Riddle's graduate programs because it does not meet the needs of experienced professionals.  As an undergraduate overview of the systems design process, it is good.  However, the author does not even touch helicopters, seaplanes, or lighter-than-air-technology.  So, the book would be more aptly named "Introduction to Airplane Design."  Some of his information on armament systems is grossly inaccurate.  Furthermore, the systems design process section does not reflect the current state of the art in the discipline of Systems Engineering.  I expect improvement in the next edition and hope the author makes more of an effort to talk to engineers on the other side of the pond 
 A few good ideas that could have been a good chapter in another book 
 Professor Pollack, a pioneer of feminist criticism and art history, has written a classic in Vision and Difference.  This new edition has a cover with her surname in bold letters, Pollack, as if playing off her famous name.  An unsturdy introduction adds a page to the length of the book.    After careful study of both editions, one will find no textural additions to this edition.    The title has been changed by juxtaposing words so that the first edition does not appear along side this version. The first edition is titled  Vision and Difference: FEMININITY, FEMINISM and the Histories of Art.  Two words have been switched.  
 These short stories could be of interest, but I cannot share the enthusiasm of other readers.  To me they are lengthy monologues by a lonesome soul, whispering to itself about trivialities. I will avoid Andre Dubus.  gerbor 
 The can has to be 100% dent free for this to work.  If you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can, this thing won't open your product.  A great idea, but this needed a little more refinement.  Paper weight in my min 
 Robert Spencer is an orientalist without formal credentials in Islamic studies, and poorly read at that.  His product is largely representative of older Western orientalist "scholarship".  He often lacks command of the subject and offers as authoritative fact his limited, master's degree level of understanding of the subject.  Frequently, he is either badly misinformed or deliberately deceptive in his selective use and interpretation of facts.  I would like to believe that his misrepresentations are out of simple ignorance for the subject, but he seems to spin facts for political and ideological gain.    In other works, he even expresses outright admiration for the brutality that was the crusades. His political agenda taints the scholarly value of his work.   If you wish to better understand Islamic history, seek a more balanced author 
 Would'nt it be a better world if this nut actually followed the teaching of Jesus? Just think about the people in New Orleans. When they were starving and their city was under water little Bush was on vacation. On the other hand Jesus fed, and cured the poor. I understand why people think  he is tough on terror if you watch the nightly news. The truth is far from the news you see everynight. The majority of the 9-11 families along with member's of the CIA, scholars,respected politicians in other countries as well as millions of americans know that 9-11 was carried out by our own govt. ( see my reviews for the books,The New Pearl Harbor,and 9-11 Inside Job) Now I dont want to give little Bush the credit for this because we all know he probably cant even tie his own shoes. Informed people know that the president really has barely no power at all. The country is really run behind the scenes. He is just a PR man speaking for a currupt Oligarchy that has fooled us into believing we live in a democracy. I know you are laughing, but think about this for a second.  Over 90% of americans are against sending our jobs and industry overseas. Over 90% would like our borders to be secure. And nearly everyone wants the oil barons to stop price gouging are fuel. If we lived in a democracy we would have our way. Their is real proof that the bush family supported the Nazi's before, during, and after ww2. (namely Prescott Bush, and George Herbert Walker) Bush is not really  a pro lifer. At home he talks the talk. However the Bush family(as well as other presidents have supported population control in other countries) He only uses religion to fool people into voting for him. He also is a member of Bohemian Grove, and Skull and Bones. Both of these institutions have large ties to the occult.( so much for him being a christian) And on a funny note He leaked National Security Information to a gay prostitute( Jeff Gannon) Now we know what he means by Mandate. LOL I hope I didnt offend anybody, We all really need to wake up. It doesnt matter if we are Right or left, Christian or Atheist. They are not looking out for any of us. If not next time there is a major terror atack we will go running to little bush so that he can protect us by taking away our freedom of speech, by more domestic spying, by a martial law police state. Than he will be the dictator that he said he wishes he could be. We will be cannon fodder so that he can invade more countries. You will wish you paid better attention. It will be too late for all of us 
 Calloway's book starts with 5 promising but not earthshattering "drive behaviors" that result in becoming indispensable.  But the book quickly becomes lots of duh's.  Among his 28 indispensable lessons: #1 "Sell the same thing as everybody else and have the lowest price."  Duh. #7 "Know your customers."  Duh And lots and lots of stories...Serious students of business development should pass on this book.  
 Bought this antenna 2 weeks ago.  High hopes.  Clearly defective!  After climbing all over the roof to install, it brought in no stations.  Put tiny bow tie antenna on the same cable and got 10 digital and 8 analog--although not as crisp as one would wish.  Replaced with a $25 Radio Shack antenna and it's outstanding.  Amazon return department was just terrific. Thanks ---- but don't bother with Terk 
 My fellow reviewers have one of two things happening:  (1) they received different discs than I, or (2) they have been smoking some very serious stuff.   The average review is five stars?   I can give it only one which is a major disappointment!   Why?   Although the title of the CD is accurate, the quality of the disk is perfectly terrible.   A number of tracks reproduce horribly and No. 2 (There I Go) is particularly bad.   One wonders why the folks that make thse recordings can't take the time to make certain that the customer gets a decent recording for his or her money.  If original master recordings need to be cleaned up in order to give the listener a fair shake then this needs to be done.   This is a perfectly wonderful assortment of Vaughn Monroe's recordings.  It is a perfectly terrible recording of them 
 I was very disappointed when receiving this book.  It is only about 5 pages long!  There is very little text as well.  The illustrations are ok, but nothing special.  It doesn't last long enough to get my 20-month old interested.  She will glance through it for about 10 seconds and toss it aside.  This is from a kid who LOVES to read 
 As this book is re-released, readers should be well aware that Michael Scheuer is the perfect example of the miserable state of American intelligence services - thankfully, he no longer provides analysis for the CIA, now it's the general public that gets to read his "intelligence". A great example of his extraordinary incompetence was provided on March 12, 2006 when he suggested to Ian Masters on KPFK, Los Angeles, that the attack on Samarra's Golden Mosque was more likely carried out by the Israeli military than by al-Qaida. From this text, as with his most recent pronouncements, it is indeed difficult not to conclude that Scheuer is absolutely besotted with bin Laden.

 I expected that Gary Sick's "All Fall Down" was going to be an exciting account of the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis.  Instead, it was a boring account of the Carter administration's reaction to  the Iranian revolution and the hostage crisis.  Sick worked for Carter when  the revolution helped turn the president's foreign policy program on its  head.  The hostage crisis more than any other event, contributed to  Carter's defeat in 1980.  Unfortunately, none of this makes for terribly  interesting reading.  The Iranian revolution is one of the most important  events in World History of the last quarter century.  But you would never  know that from reading this book 
 Carol Gilligan has written a fascinating book.  Using a multifaceted approach, she examines the origins of dissociative trauma -- that psychological split within ourselves where we can know and not know, feel but not feel -- and its path to the suppression of pleasure and authenticity.  Gilligan argues that the foundational myths of Western society are virtually all based on trauma, societal control, and violence. The author takes her readers on a journey through memory, literature, psychological research, and ancedote to examine how we are societally trained to avoid experiencing genuine happiness.  The book, though, ends where it begins.  "Patriarchy" sets up the trauma and maintains it, Gilligan argues at the book's outset.  The writer, though, never tells us what she means by "patriarchy" and, in the end, it becomes an amorphous demon, meaningless except as a convenient all-encompassing scapegoat.  Still, "The Birth of Pleasure" is worth reading for its intriguing questions and for what it might have been 
 Perhaps for finance graduate students this book is appropriate but for the rest of us reasonably intelligent folks this book makes no sense at all.    Simple concepts should be explained and then used as building blocks for more complex ones; this book starts complex, the authors then rant about whatever they like or don't like, and then go on to something else even more complex. All the while leaving the reader befuddled about what these guys were talking about in the first place.  I suspect they're doing some grandstanding, trying to impress us with their intelligence.  All right I'm impressed, now how about teaching me finance?  Professors, have mercy on your students.  Use a text that offers clarity and supplements classroom lectures; this book does neither. 
 In this self-aggrandizing attempt to position the Braves as the most successful franchise of the past 100 years of baseball, Schuerholz offers very little insight on how to run a successful franchise and instead focuses on stories that leave you saying in the end, "who cares."    The book at times feels like it is being written on a 4th-grade reading level and I could not in good conscious recommend it to any baseball fan. 
 What is this person trying to prove? Most of this book was created on a racist bent, not very professional if you ask me. Shouldn't we be enjoying their gifts to mankind, instead of crying about something so petty and childish? Egypt was a melting pot, GET OVER IT! Besides, the race of these wonderfull people shouldn't matter. Quit befouling a glorious culture with modern day "politics." 
 The important top hand bar is missing. The thing smells like gear grease. I can't tell if I like to use is, because it's missing parts 
 The back cover of my copy of Stranger In A Strange Land has a quote on it from the Washington Post.  It says that it's "the best of (Robert Heinlein's) many books".  Well, if this is the best Mr. Heinlein can do, then I won't bother reading any more of his books.  Stranger In A Strange Land is one of the most disappointing "classics" I've ever read.  If you think you'd like a book where the Muslim character is nicknamed Stinky, the women are called "wenches", and one of the female characters says the following, "Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault", then this is the book for you.  I could probably overlook these missteps if only the rest of the book wasn't such hippy-dippy pseudo-intellectual garbage.  Stranger In A Strange Land may have been a classic in the Sixties.  Now it's little more than an embarrassment.       
 The Onkyo TX-8522 receiver lasted less than one month. I purchased it to replace a Fisher receiver I have had for 36+ years. Thought it was time to replace it. While listening to one of my favorite jazz tunes this new Onkyo receiver sparked - followed by the smell of a burning resistor. Needless to say I put my 36+ year old Fisher receiver back in service and continued listening to my favorite jazz tunes. They just don't make them like they use to. More to follow pending the results of the repair 
 Geoffrey Perret is generally a fair historian and decent writer. His biographies of MacArthur, Eisenhower, and Grant were readable, but not great. In his biography of JFK, somewhat different ground for Perret, he comes across as a tabloid writer more than a historian. This is particularly evident in the early chapters, where Perret seems more focused on the homosexuality of Lem Billings than on anything having to do with JFK. Skip this one 
 don't know what's going on with these three dvds, the storyline of at the end of each dvd is a broken link that simply fails to connect with the next one. worthless 3 pcs of junk. the book is a slow tempo book with deadbeat narrative speed, then the dvds seem to surpass the slowliness of the book. given 4 to 5 stars? you must have very creative imagination of at least 2 extra dvds : 
 Method: Take a monster, genre defining album you recorded over 15 years ago, borrow the voicings, polyrhythms and sound effects, rearrange them to slightly (but not *that*) different tunes, crib the album art (cheesy then; cheesier now) and re-release.  The point? Well, to The Man, it's obvious. There's one born every minute. But for genuine, discerning afficionados of electronica? Search me. Like a good souffle, it was better the first time.  Indeed, inventing Oxygene Parts 7 - 13 is almost as pointless an exercise as going back and re-recording the original album from scratch. And guess what turned out to be Jarre's next project?   Whoops! Writer's block, perchance?  Olly Buxto 
 The AC adaptor and sound selections are great, but the sound is way too low, even on the highest level. I foolishly bought this, knowing that others thought it was too low...but it really is SO LOW you can't hear it 4 feet away. Turned out to be a 20 buck paperweight for me. 
 I wrote a review of what I take as a significant distortion and failing of this book.  I note that this review has not been posted on the site.  I am wondering why 
 If you like Richard Cheese, quirky covers, Squirel Nut Zippers, Misfits, Louie Prima, SAVE YOUR MONEY. I like the Devo and Ramones EZ listening covers but this is lame Casio synth organ horns, not lounge music. Think Mystery Science Theater closing theme. (Sorry Joel! Big Fan). If you realy want this album and you live in Los Angeles, I plan to wing my copy onto Interstate 5. Wish I'd read the reviews like you are. Try some Me first and the Gimme, Gimme or Dread Zeppelin. 
 This is a short book with wide spacing, large fonts, and many trivial examples.  To people who have read "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" or other references, this book offers nothing.  Reading the book is often uncomfortable.  The author is not funny, cute, expert, authoritative, or anything else that he tries to be 
 Robin Hobb knows how to write well and proved it with Assassin's Apprentice. Unfortunately, she seems to be in love with her descriptive prose and forgets mundane items such as plot, action, and likable (or at least interesting) characters. Ship of Magic suffers from an excess of flowery prose adorning a dull, meandering story containing uninteresting and mostly unlikable characters. I read a quarter of the book and stopped. Some of the (mostly glowing) reviews claim that the book gets better, but my patience dwindled to naught.  Specific things I disliked:  1. Another Hobb book in which magic but inanimate objects (the wood of the liveship) come to life only after multiple people (three generations of ship owners, in this book) die while touching the object. Can't her magic creatures have lives and personalities of their own?  2. Teens and young adults rarely learn from mistakes and repeatedly act stupid. (Maybe they are all budding politicians.)  3. The interwoven story of sea serpents from some other plane of existence is distracting because of lack of context. It probably will make sense later, but it adds nothing but confusion in the early chapters. Hobb should have started the book at the middle or near-end of the story (so we would know the importance of the serpents and the liveships) and then gone back in time.  4. The members of the main family are mostly unlikable. The only likable one has unrealistic lines: the 13-year-old acolyte talks like a 50-year-old philosopher 
 As someone who "gobbles" up anything related to timetravel/speculation/inconsistencies and so on, I was drawn to this book from the synopsis and the marketing premise that I considered (after  reading) to be misleading. While the book does offer investigations into  possible evidence of timetravel; it is only thrown in periodically  throughout an otherwise boring read. In fact, I've read hundreds of books  in the speculative nature and sadly, this is the ONLY ONE I haven't  enjoyed 
 This is really sad, this is an otherwise excellent collection. But in today's quest for everything to be LOUD, the over compressed this so that it's lost almost all dynamic range, and is just stressfull to listen to. You hear things you never did before-- BECAUSE THAT WEREN"T SUPPOSED TO STAND OUT IN THE MIX!  Everything just stays at the same level, it sounds like there are some phase issues on some tracks as well.  I just encoded a couple tracks and the originals, do that if you want to see it-- the songs are all peaked at max level throughout on the remaster. The original has highs and lows...well, dynamics! imagine that!  This is unlistenable to me, stick with the original. Of course it may be worth having for the rare stuff, sadly that's no better. Every instrument at the same level. REM from this time is classic, but they've butchered it 
 Don't read this book if you are suicidal. It will not relieve your pain. It is far too academic and not helpful at all to suicidal people. Recommended only for professionals 
 Well, straight out I will admit that I am only half-way through this book, but already, I feel really bogged down, and slightly confused.    Ms. Myss seems to take a rather overly authoritative tone in this book, as she mixes Jungian psychology, Eastern religions and divination, all in an attempt to convince her readers that through her guidance they can come to know the destinies chosen for them before their birth, their "Sacred Contracts".  I feel that the author tends to over simplify the concepts of destiny, and pre-destination, as well as the nature of evil, and does so through a rather verbose, and strangely vague text.  I think that my eyes were really opened when I visited Ms. Myss' website and read the answers she had given to questions by her readers.  Her arrogant attitude and insistance that her way is the only way, left a sour taste in my mouth, I must say.  Many asked questions such as, "I can't narrow my personality down to only 8 archtypes, no matter how hard I try," and, "You insist that there are four archtypes that everyone has, no matter what.  I don't feel that I have all of these."  These questions were met with the insistance that there were only 8 archtypes, and that everyone has the four, no matter what.  Ms. Myss makes her "theory" sound like it is academically proven fact, which it is absolutely not.  I'm not sure that even Jung would agree to the way that his concepts of the archtype have been used in this book.  In summary, I am not sure that I will finish reading the book.  I want to, just to see if there is something that I am missing closer to the end, but from many of the reviews that I have read here, I'm not so sure it's worth it.  I suggest taking the book out from the library before you purchase it.  Some may like the authoritative tone, and complex theories of the book.  I did not 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 The 2nd Edition Exam Cram has been surplanted by "A+ Exam Cram 2," a thoroughly revised and  updated version of the book.

 This book is only good if you have absolutely zero experience or knowledge of podcasting.  If you have already recorded a few shows, this book isn't for you 
 I haven't seen work of this quality since high school AV class. Friends of Ram Dass will skip this embarrassing mess like first period biology. Too bad this story wasn't entrusted to a more competent documentarian. 
 Great song writer but hard on the ear , my kids were in the back begging me too turn it off . 
 This is a deeply flawed book. It purports to be a description of the characteristics and attitudes that make wealthy people wealthy, but it is based mostly on their self-assessments without comparison to a control group. I suspect that this heavily underplays the role of random chance in success, and attributes causation where there is only correlation. Further, the author displays clear biases on a number of topics, which leads him to engage in ad hoc interpretation of his data, sometimes to argue for conclusions that are contrary to the clear implications of the data--such as his arguments for the importance of religion in the lives of millionaires.  On pp. 33-35, the author looks at success factors, and compares to the role of luck on pp. 82-85, which he downplays in favor of discipline. While he touches on the importance of having the right connections (and the genetic contributions to intelligence), on p. 85 he asks "what does luck have to do with graduating from medical school? What does luck have to do with successfully running a medical practice? Very little, according to these physicians." But what does luck have to do with being born into a family and in a country where one has a chance to reach adulthood, let alone be able to attend a medical school? Quite a bit.  Unlike its predecessor, which looked at prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAWs) vs. under-accumulators of wealth (UAWs), this book focuses on millionaires (PAWs) and decamillionaires (a tiny subset of PAWs, those with net worth $10M or greater). The lack of comparison to the general public serves to limit the book's value.  A misleading comparison between businessmen and stockbrokers on pp. 76ff makes the point. Stanley states that the former is an occupation more likely to have higher net worth. But this comparison is misleading because he's only looking at the millionaire-plus sample; he is excluding more of the total business owner population from his sample than stockbrokers. The average and median income and net worth for business owners are likely lower than for stockbrokers. If he made the same comparison with actors or musicians to stockbrokers, for example, the problem is more obvious--by excluding all those who aren't worth $1M or more up front, you exclude the vast majority, and pull up the average. With stockbrokers, on the other hand, a higher percentage of them are in the top income earners and wealthy.  On p. 110, after having pages about the importance of ethics and advising "Never lie. Never tell one lie." (p. 55), he passes right over his example, Mr. Warren, lying about being a college graduate in order to get a job, without comment, and without noticing the hypocrisy.  On pp. 173-174, the author wants to make the point that prayer is important for millionaires dealing with stress, despite the fact that the majority of his surveyed population do not regularly pray. (He repeats this again on p. 370, saying "nearly one-half of the millionaires (47 percent) engaged in prayer. ... for a significant percentage of millionaires, their religious faith is a major force in their lives.")  In trying to emphasize the point (p. 174), he splits his sample into "religious millionaires" (RM) and "other millionaires" (OM), observes that 75% of RM engage in prayer while only 8% of OM do, and points out that this is "a ratio of more than nine to one." This is a meaningless comparison, however--RM make up only 37% of his total population of millionaires, so his "more than nine to one" ratio is really nothing more than saying, of those millionaires who are religious, three-fourths hold religious practices which involve regular prayer (and 8% of those who do not consider themselves religious pray anyway). Since the OM population is much larger than the RM population, in absolute numbers that's not a nine-to-one ratio--his numbers show that about 28% of his total sample are RM who pray, while 5% of his total sample are OM who pray--closer to a six-to-one ratio.  But more importantly, the author glosses over the fact that not only are the majority of millionaires not religious, even a quarter of those who are don't engage in regular prayer! Given that the U.S. is one of the most religious countries in the world, the fact that such a low percentage of millionaires are religious is quite interesting and worthy of further exploration as to the cause, but for Stanley, religion and prayer are an important foundation of the "millionaire mind," and he completely misses the opportunity to find an explanation for why millionaires are so much less religious than the general population.  In a later table in the book on p. 366, he shows activities engaged in by a sample of 733 millionaires during the preceding 30 days. The table includes 52% attending religious services, 47% praying, 37% attending religious events, 22% Bible/devotional reading. These numbers don't quite match up with the RM/OM data from pp. 173-174, which seem to show even lower levels of religious activity, but these are still lower than they are for the nonmillionaire population--and weekly church attendance is notoriously over-reported in surveys. Work by Mark Chaves, C. Kirk Hardaway, and P.L. Marler in the 1990s found the actual percentage of attendance about half of what surveys show. This actually could mean that millionaires attend more often, if Stanley's survey results don't have similar over-reporting.  The author's religious bias further leads him to recommend to a student going through a divorce that she, despite not being a church attendee, search for a mate by joining a church group (p. 268) because she "believed in marriage and the traditional family concept." He writes that "I believe that one is likely to find better prospects in a church setting than in singles bars. Of course, there are no guarantees, but people with a religious orientation are more prone to respect the principles espoused in the Good Book." But why is he just guessing on this? Hasn't he asked his population of millionaires--the ones who are 63% non-religious--how they met their mates? He did this, very usefully, regarding how millionaires purchase their homes (pp. 315-326)--yet isn't picking a partner even more important?      This book has some interesting data, and is at its best when giving comparative results between populations (e.g., the house-purchasing characteristics of economically productive millionaires vs. non-economically productive millionaires in chapter 7). But it doesn't stand up well in comparison to The Millionaire Next Door, which is a much better book 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 Eating right and eating 6 times is great but no exercise? Took ideas from well known facts and change some to make no sense. 
 This has to be one of the most frustrating and dull spirituality and live food books I have ever read. There are pages and pages of 'the author' (he refers to himself in the third person) procrastinating on religion, history etc. Yup he's right, a live food diet will raise your kundalini. So does walking in the counrty, having a great love life, being positive and doing work you love. Which is basically what he is saying here.There, I've managed to say it in two sentances. If you're into personal growth, and spiritual development, try David Wolfe's books. Even though he plagurised Nature's First Law, the original is out of print, but it's a raw food philosophy masterpiece all the same. It's also the third of the length of Cousen's book. Or read Leonard Orr's Breaking The Death Habit, or the Indian classic 'Autobiography of a Yogi.' These three books will open your mind and soul to new and real possibilitesin an authentic heartfelt way, without the ego of the author getting in the way.  
 I agree with many of the other reviewers.  This book seems to have been written by a 12 year old boy.  Simplistic, almost cartoonish, plot and character development.  I found it so unbearable after about 50 pages, it went in the trash 
 I live in northern California, so rain is nothing new to me.  I've been putting off getting a large umbrella for quite some time now, but since I signed up for free Amazon Prime, I figure I'd buy everything I've been wanting for 30 straight days.  This umbrella made my list because I've read some decent reviews on it, plus it's affordable but I guess you get what you pay for.  The first umbrella came and the tip was split.  I ask for a replacement from Amazon which arrived next day (nice service) however, I wish this umbrella is as good as Amazon's service, because the replacement umbrella also arrived damaged.  Except this one is far worse; the entire tip is missing.  Since this is the replacement, Amazon will only do a refund.  By the way I'm STILL without an umbrella 
 I had never read this book as I child but since I knew it was a classic I decided to buy it for my daughter.  I never realized that Curious George and his owner smoke pipes and make it look appealing.  I guess this has to do with the fact that this book is very old.  If you dont' mind giving your child the idea that smoking a pipe is acceptable than buy this book for your child.  Mine won't be reading it 
 Schon focuses his book on "reflection in action" and "reflection on reflection in action".  While reading this book, he did make me self-aware of many teaching techniques that I currently use, but very little new ground was broken here.  Not really worth reading, but may be of some value to new "professionals"  
 I was very eager to buy this CD. I have the CD Elixir and I love it. I saw and heard fourplay in Atlanta and they were awesome. However, this CD has too much computerized music. Too many sythensized voices. Very predictable. In my estimation, a bunch of tracks to play on smooth jazz radio stations or in an elevator as mindless filler. I didn't care for this one at all 
 First of all, the track listing is wrong from what appears on the Amazon site as of 6-14-2006. It's not even close.  Second, there are no demos on this. Am I missing something?? I preordered this to get the demos and all we have are live recordings. The sound on this is awful, very similar to the Stooges live recordings. If your familar with those, you know what I mean. I would have given it one star, but it is still a interesting listen, as I love The New York Dolls. I'm shocked they would release this the way it sounds. It appears to be a attempt to make money without putting a dime in cleaning up the sound on this. The Vancouver show is the only decent recording on this release 
 "The WD Passport hard drive requires a little over 1000mA of power at spin up" says the WD troubleshooting website.  Why no mention of that here or on its product page? My usb drive provides 500mA so I need another cable. Extra cost and extra delay. What cheek.   I advise you to check what power your usb port provides before ordering this.   
 What a great idea for Universal to release some early  Cary Grant films, since he was under contract with Paramount and made over 15 pictures for that studio. But what a horrible choice of titles...Who sits on top of Universal Home video and points his finger to some of the worst movies ever made? What about consulting a film historian for a change, instead of a marketing guy? "Kiss and Make Up" is probably Grant's worst film ever, the unfunniest comedy of the 30s with the actor ostensibly trying to make something out of a bad script. Not to mention "Wedding Present" and "Big Brown Eyes", what a comedic misfires...As for "Wings in the Dark", believe it or not, Grant plays a blind aviator who flies up to the sky to save Myrna Loy from falling (in a way it's also sort of, unintentionally, funny). The only good one is "Thirty Day Princess"...  These people at Universal just ignored that at Paramount Grant made two great films, one of them never published at all and it's called "Hot Saturday", a pre-code, pre-lib, comedy in which Nancy Carroll gets it her own way without paying any price, actually she wins a wonderful prize...The other title (published just on video) is "The Eagle and the Hawk" with Fredric March and Carole Lombard. And among better films he made for the studio "The Woman Accused", "This is the Night" and "Madame Butterfly". Shame on you Universal.   And for the future, if you have in mind a Claudette Colbert Collection or Fredric March or Miriam Hopkins, please ask for some advice 
 I know that a lot of books will have a next installment in the series, but at least they will usually try to tie up loose ends in some sort of fashion.  This book just left you hanging.  I thought, "Is that really the end?!?"   I liked it otherwise 
 The jacket story and reviews got me to buy this book... what a waste of money.  The characters are weak stereotypes and the storyline's nothing special at all.  I guess in this day and age anyone can publish a book about nothing, but to make matters worse Hallman's writing (I think he likes to think of himself as a research journalist) is laughable and his research deplorable.  He tries to write a revisionist history through the eyes of a self-admitted novice perspective and makes a fool of himself.    Being a chess enthusiast, I figured I would push on for awhile.  To my horror his description of his chess-master pal is a disgrace to most chess players; making them seem like anti-social, self-absorbed bums that are out of touch with reality and politics.  Though this stock character may make for interesting reading in the hands of an average author, Hallman brings out the worst in stereotyping and one ends up disliking those we need to like in order to make the story readable.  Hallman overexerts himself to find tangents of interest, even tracking down a lama (of which are a dime a dozen in the area he's interested in) that renounced his vows in favor of rock'n'roll.  The connection is so labored that Hallman seems like one of those people you run into at a party that makes sure you understand how important they are because they went to school with George Clooney's cousin.  Calling Hallman's writing incoherent babbling would be an insult to the deranged... NEVER BUY THIS BOOK.    May not agree with me- doesn't make it unhelpful!!! And don't say I didn't warn you 
 Gee, I wonder how many of these other "reviews" are legit? Any adult who believes in Ramtha is deluded. What The Bleep is New-Age pap and bad science. If you like The Secret then this is right up your alley 
 I found a lot of the explanations to be too brief or dificult to follow. Many of the questions I have are not cover at all and when I needed help with roll-over techniques, the section is completely missing from my copy. I realize this is not the author's fault but it was the preverbial straw 
 This book isn't really the place to start learning about stochastic calculus. Get Oskendal's "Stochastic Differential Equations' for this.   Even to the prepared reader, this book is exasperating. It is as if the authors came up with an excellent outline for an advanced treatment of this topic. Then they realized that to do all of the material justice, they'd need to have not one, but two 400 page volumes. Their publisher must have balked at that idea, so their solution was to leave out half the detail, forcing each of our poor readers to re-generate the missing 400 pages of needed detail on his/her own. In the opinion of this reviewer, that is exactly what they have done with this text.   Fortunately for us all, there exists a nice two volume (800 page total pages) treatment of this material. Rogers & Williams "Diffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales" provides a thorough, accessible exposition with all the needed rigor, generality and detail.  Karatzas & Shreve's treatment of early foundational material is less than helpful to the student. Consider a pair of key results on martingales early on in the text: the optional sampling theorem and the optional stopping theorem. The authors "prove" the optional sampling theorem by appealing to the discrete time results in Chung's "A Course in Probability Theory" text and then applying limiting arguments to bootstrap to the continuous time case. Since all of the real "ideas" are in the discrete time case, it's not clear how much of a service the authors' treatment really is. Worse yet, the optional stopping theorem isn't even called out as a theorem, but instead buried as problem.  It is curious to see which topics inspire the authors to spill ink. For example in Chapter 2, we get not one, but 3, yes three different constructions of Brownian motion: convolved heat kernels, Haar interpolation and random walks/Wiener measure.  Of course, only the last construction is used going forward and the first two constructions are not brimming over with detail. This is a curious indulgence in a text that is purposefully being stingy with detail. Our poor reader has to pay the price for this indulgence with an extremely terse treatment of the strong Markov property and reflection principle, the Blumenthal Zero-One Law, and other foundational properties of Brownian motion.   Chapter 3 represents the core of the text and develops all the of "greatest hits" including the Ito Integral, Ito's rule, Levy's characterization of Brownian motion, the martingale representation theorem, the Girsanov Theorem and an introduction of Brownian local time. (Brownian local time is further developed in Chapter 6). The development of the Ito Integral is shamelessly sketchy. All the theorems are correctly stated, but the "proofs" offered aren't detailed enough to explain why all of the stated assumptions are needed. When the reader gets to the development of Ito's rule, he/she finds a rude 3 sentence introduction to semi-martingales, a topic which hadn't been explored and never gets more than a passing mention in the authors' text.  Assuming that you've understood everything going on in the text up to this point, Chapter 4 is quite nice. It gives a very intuitive introduction in the role of the Mean Value Theorem as a hook connecting stochastic integrals with classical PDE's. The section on Harmonic functions and the Dirichlet problem is quite nice. The material on the heat equation requires properties of Brownian motion most easily derived from the convolved heat kernels construction. The chapter winds up with a nice treatment of the Feynman-Kac formulas.  After the PDE's material, the reader might develop a sense of hope that the remainder of the exposition will be readily accessible. This is not the case and with the SDE's in Chapter 5, the authors return to their now too familiar terse style as they study strong and weak solutions to stochastic differential equations. At one point, the authors decide to approach the problem by generalizing from functions to functionals without even so much as defining their notion of a functional.  Really, the only good role for this text is as base material for a do-it-yourself "Moore Method" class on stochastic calculus, like they used to do for general topology at the University of Texas. If you completed a Moore-style class this way and wrote up all of your work, you'd have a very fine text covering diffusions, Markov processes, and martingales 
 I find it much more difficult to navigate this book than, say, Moreland and Fleisher's book of Latin grammar. Furthermore, it's verbosity is frequently difficult to penetrate. The author seems to have an aversion to synthetic explanation, relying instead on an overabundance of examples that serve to clarify little of the readers confusion 
 I wish I had read the customer reviews before purchasing this. My wife just tried to use our Kitchenaide egg slicer for the first time and two of the wires snapped as she tried to slice up some strawberries. Do not purchase this egg slicer! It is a waste of $10 
 I'm a big conspiracy buff, have read quite a bit of alternative news and views, and I must say this book is a huge dissappointment.  In fact, it's disspointing to the point of being suspect.  The articles included here in this collection are neither "astonishing" nor "hidden."  There is little information to back up the claims of the authors, and nothing noteworthy is delivered in their promises of hidden knowledge.    A perfect example is the article on the 33rd parallel and ancient to modern anomalies regarding this phenomenon.  Of course, the author just lays out the "syncronicities", but doesn't go so far as to even attempt to illuminate the reader of ideas surrounding it's significance.  They don't go into details of links between the Knights Templars and modern masonry, historical numerology, occult tie-ins, or contemporary theories involving the Illuminati.    The Disinfo guide delivers what it promises, half-baked leads with no end in sight, and enough disinfo regarding ancient history to make you swear off researching the topic for good.  Avoid this, and any other Disinfo book, as this one indicates the author takes his job of spreading disinfo seriously 
 I thought this book was boring and too drawn out. It took me over 3 months to read simply because I didn't want to pick it back up! The plot was good...it was different but as with all of Ms. Steel's novels, it is centered around a beautiful rich, successful woman, Isabella, who has some sort of tragedy and we read about her sadness and depression for most of the book until she finally meets someone to help her pick up the shattered pieces of her broken heart. This book is very, very slow and I found myself falling asleep every time I read it. I would not reccommend it. She has better novels out there 
 Yes. Wild things is what I recommend for our jaded eyes. Aren't we sick of all the crowd pleasing PG-13 shows which are neither sexy or action packed - most of all with hardly a plot? Wild Things is sex sex sex but with witty capital H humor and a twisted story.  Recent eye candy shows could learn a thing or two from this film. Candy can remain sweet and sickening but a great script and a good cast (from Oscar nominee Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon etc) can turn candy into cuisine 
 I thought the Document would give a much better in depth look at how Google works.  It didn't, I only found a couple of points that I considered valuable.

 I normally don't write reviews but I just read this book and I couldn't believe how much of a waste of money it was. Here's the book in a nutshell- Hire good employees and fire bad ones 
 The production and performances in 'Final Stab' are good. What brings the movie down is the characters. Within the first 10 minutes of meeting this self-obsessed, apathetic group of characters, I found myself rooting for the killer. The premise of the film is basic and unoriginal. An obnoxious woman (I am being kind) puts together a mystery weekend for her just as obnoxious friends (primarily getting all of them there by extortion). She has hired an actor to play a masked killer for the evening, but alas, a real killer has invaded the evening and they all still think the deaths are just good acting. One of the funniest scenes has the Brittney Spears wannabe approached by the killer, whom she thinks is the actor, and remarks (paraphrased) "Is this going to be messy?". As the killer is stabbing her, her boyfriend is watching from a window and is seriously impressed by her 'good performance'. 'Final Stab' is not poorly made, just poorly conceived. It is difficult to like a film when there are no characters to like. This is too bad, since with some character development and a less disjointed story they could have had a good movie; the basic ingredients were there.--Bo 
 Very flimsy, chintzy, etc... My five year old cannot play with this because it keeps falling apart!  I would return it except she's playing with all the "clothes" that come with it.  I wish I had read reviews before I paid money for it. We have other Polly Pocket stuff and are happy with it.  This however, it a piece of JUNK!  Don't waste your money 
 Glass broke second time shaker used.  Entire glass base broke away from cylinder.  Returned entire item to seller for refund 
 We have used a Cuisinart for about 25 years! It is getting worn out and parts are not available to make it like new. The Kitchenaid looks great and has plenty of power but, and that is a big BUT, it does not work to do what we want. First the amount of fluid that it can hold is pathetic compared to the old Cuisinart. The Kitchenaid leaked like a sieve via the gap between the lid and the bowl. The complicated "safety" system that allows something to be placed in the feeder tube but not fingers also prevents us slicing a cucumber or even a reasonable sized potato! I wonder who designs these products.. obviously no-one who cooks! When our Cuisinart finally gives up my wife says she will go back to a knife. We tried this product and returned it for a full refund thanks to Amazon 
 In the Introduction the authors state "their stories can serve as an inspiration to all of us."Then later they talk about how David Geffen lied to his employer about being a college grad and then arrived early each  day to go through the mail to find letter from college. When it arrive he  steamed it open, obtained a new letterhead and wrote his own letter  verifying he was a graduate. Great lesson on how to get ahead. Just what I  want my children to learn 
 I was hoping that this book would seek to represent the risks and advantages in an unbiased way but alas it is clearly situated in the anti-vaccination camp.  The author's background and conclusions reveal an interest in promoting alternative and natural medicine, which is not wrong, just be aware of it.    I'm going the way of selective vaccinations and my pediatrician even supports my decisions and agrees that the vaccines I am leaving out carry a very low risk of infection in the first place.  I did not forego DTaP because statistics indicate that Pertussis is a very real threat and the vaccination has put a serious dent in this disease's fatalities. I also plan to get MMR because of recent evidence in Germany that measles can make a comeback if enough parents get scared and refuse the vaccine.    For a more optimistic look at vaccines you should consult something by Paul Offit MD.  Yes, it is probably also biased in favor of medicine but you might as well read both extremes in order to make an informed decision.  
 After attending a recent lecture by Dr Hira, I found his book and his ideas on US economic evolution incomplete and wavering. Unfortunately, its not information are not grounded or empirical based on US employment trends and globalization.   I recommend you keep looking for better volumes 
 While I agree with the majority of the viewpoints in Ms. Sykes book, it gets tiresome. About halfway through the book, the soapbox format gets old. It takes little talent to write in such a perscribed format 
 I bought this book because I like to throw my PCs into differing environments to keep them guessing. While it does have a lot of rules for various low temperature environments, the book just didn't make me feel cold. The same goes for Sandstorm. The book didn't make me feel hot. The only environment book that ever succeeded in making me feel like "I was there" was Dreadmire, by Spellbinder Games.  Wizards of the Coast needs to take a hint from that book -- it made me feel like I was in a swamp.  Frostburn offers various rules for cold and ice, but it does not offer us anything of real value. We don't need many more feats and skills, if any.  We need substance, and this book has only redundancy and fluff. If you still have the old Wilderness Survival Guide and Dungeoneers Survival Guide, don't bother with Frostburn -- most of the rules in those old books are still applicable today 
 This is too basic a book for therapists.  Don't let it's large size fool you.  Ok for parents who need some guidance 
 In the immortal words of Gene Autry: How can anyone be right, when everybody's wrong?  Mr. Garea's (Amazon's Spotlight review) thoughtful, well written critique on the Heisenberg portrayed in Mr. Rose's book is "compleat" (yuck yuck), and there is nothing I need to add.  Mr. Rose's slashing attack on Mr. Heisenberg is too simplistic, fails to take into account the impact of the political, economic and moral collapse of Weimar Germany on the German people, and plays too heavily on what Mr. Rose sees as 400 unchanging years of Germanic totalitatian culture.  Heisenberg's harshest critics, the Nobel Laureates Lenard and Stark with their Newtonian cause & effect "German Physics" (as opposed to "Jewish Physics" ie relativity & disputes about quantum mechanics a la Einstein and Niels Bohr), they were the ones falsely tied to a vision of Germanic Culture.  Not Heisenberg.  Where I part ways with Mr. Garea is in Mr. Garea's tounge in cheek portrayal of a Werner Heisenberg qua James Bond (maybe not Sean Connery or Roger Moore--more like a Timothy Dalton or George Lazenby) from Thomas Powers "Heisenberg's War: the Secret History of the German Bomb."  Whatever else he was, Mr. Heisenberg was no smoothie--a common denominator for Bondness.  However, I am convinced by Mr. Powers's thesis that Mr. Heisenberg did retard Germany's development of the atomic bomb.  No, Heisenberg did not "fake" math calculations or create false evidence, but as Mr. Powers carefully documents, Heisenberg did work hard to create a false impression of the feasibility of creating an atom bomb.  Of the different opportunities that Heisenberg had for pushing development of a German A-bomb, none could have been as fortuitous as the June 1942 meeting with Albert Speer.  Speer had just been appointed Hitler's honcho to get the economy on a war footing, and develop some answer to the allies increasingly relentless and unanswerable bombing missions.  Additionally, the Nazi regime needed to do something about the military reverses at Moscow.  If Heisenberg wanted to build an atom bomb, Speer was ready to fund one.  Instead, Heisenberg gave a deliberately obtuse presentation about the atom bomb.  Heisenberg was well aware that a reactor would create the fissonable element 94 (plutonium), but instead spoke generally of "transuranics."  This conscious fogging of the science intentionally left a false impression on Speer's science advisor, a physical chemist named Lieb.  After the meeting, Lieb (incorrectly) believed that only U-235 could be used for a bomb, and that there was no viable way to separate U-235 from U-238.  Heisenberg knew better--plutonium could replace U-235--and how much fissonable material was needed for a critical mass: about the size of a pineapple.  Finally, Heisenberg told Speer that perhaps a working reactor could be built in 1942, but a bomb could not be built before 1945.  These dates are key for two reasons.  First, the dates are outside the parameters that Speer needed, and second: they were also damn good guesses.  Mr. Fermi created the world's first sustained chain reactor in Chicago in December, 1942 and the US blew up the first bomb in July 1945.  Finally, if Heisenberg really wanted to go all out on a German bomb, there was Speer ready to write the big checks.  Instead, Heisenberg & his people asked for piddling amounts of funding to continue basic research--so small that Speer promptly lost interest in atom bombs.  The importance of this June 1942 Meeting, and the difference between what Heisenberg knew and what he told Speer is lost on Mr. Rose.  Heisenberg did consciously retard German developments of an A-bomb, if only by deliberately creating several key false impressions--not exactly the stuff that wins hearts of Ursula Andress, Jill St. John or even Sophie Marceau, but it still counts.    Nevertheless, how should we account for Heisenberg's inconsistent actions both during and especially after the war?  Mr. Powers suggests several reasons, but I do not believe he gives enough creedence to Heisenberg's (and most Germans) fear & distrust of Soviet Russia.  Many individuals in the West initially excused Nazi excesses in the name of restoration of the economy (if only taming rampent inflation), and creating a bulwark against Stalinism.  One of Heisenberg's key co-workers was a (now former) communist sympathizer who returned to Nazi Germany after two & a half years in a Soviet prison, with a forced bogus confession of being a Gestapo-Trotsky-Bukharin spy.  Something needed to be done about Stalin.  Moreover, post WWI Germany featured seemingly endless rises and collapses of Governments.  At the time, it was not unreasonable to believe that Hitler's thousand year reich would be replaced in next year's coup by the Christian Democrats, or the Weirmarcht would throw out the Nazis, and continue a secular (as opposed to Nazi racist paganism) military dictatorship.  The post WWII alibi of the "good germans" was not only that they "didn't know," but that "someone" needed to stop Stalin (not to mention the crap about building the autobahn, but we digress).  Finally, Heisenberg's seemingly inconsistent statements after the war are probably a combination of his foolish pride (OF COURSE he could have built a bomb--if he REALLY wanted to), and his awkward speaking style.  This last point is more of an impression--but Heisenberg was a physicist, not a politician or a public speaker.  He could talk about science with exactness--but outside of that realm, he left much to be desired.  In short, I am convinced by Mr. Powers's arguments and the breath of his documentation.  Mr. Rose needed to pay closer attention to Powers's book, and the documentation used by Powers.  As a final note on both this book and Mr. Powers's book--indeed, since Heisenberg's death in 1976, any book about Heisenberg--an important source as to Heisenberg's postwar views is the 1967 book "The German Atomic Bomb," and a battery of extensive personal interviews, all by David Irving.  Mr. Powers merely cites this source--an undisputedly important source--without comment.  Still, as a historian, there is no question that Mr. Irving's reputation has taken a beating.  See, for example, "Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial" by Richard J. Evans.  Mr. Irving has recently been sentenced to three years imprisonment in Austria as a "holocaust denier."  What all Mr. Irving's personal beliefs, credentials, and current legal woes add to the discussion of Heisenberg's activities from 1939 to 1945, I do not know.  I have no idea what Mr. Irving's views were in 1965-1967, when Mr. Irving extensively interviewed Heisenberg and wrote his book--and if Heisenberg was aware of those views in giving such time and access to Mr. Irving.  I only mention this as an additional piece of the Heisenberg puzzle that may (or may not) mean anything.  Be that as it may, the bottom line is: Read Powers's book, and not this one.  And Amazon is damn lucky to have thorough reviewers like Mr. Garea 
 The story of Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire" is told through images and thoughts.  Abandon all expectations of seeing anything resembling a conventional film before watching it.      Two angels glide through the streets of Berlin surveying its inhabitants.  Cassiel (Otto Sander) embraces his role as witness but Damiel (Bruno Ganz) wants to break free of his ethereal existence.  He is willing to cast aside his immortality in order to experience the simple joys of everyday life.  The primary catalyst for his desire to change is his attraction to trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin).   "Wings of Desire" does not quite work.  It stumbles not because it is too pretentious or too ponderous.  Rather, it stumbles because it is just too abstract.   Relying on imagery and monologues to tell a story makes for an interesting lesson in unconventional filmmaking, but it also leads to frustration and annoyance to anyone conditioned to more traditional narratives.  "Wings of Desire" deserves a lot of credit for its innovative approach toward its material and its beautiful dream-like visuals.  Yet, it is a film that unfortunately will not appeal much to the mainstream viewer.  
 ﻿In the end, it appears that by "anti-Catholic prejudice", Jenkins means a failure to regard what he considers to be the core of the Roman Catholic church with sufficient reverence.   He would probably characterize most of the practicing Catholics I know as near-heretical.  Jenkins uses related but distinct words like "bigotry" and "prejudice" interchangeably. It is clear by the end that a great deal of what he is terming "prejudice", which is usually applied to hostility from outsiders, is in fact internal dissent and dissatisfaction from current and former Catholics.  I refuse to be embarrassed on behalf of my society at large if the hierarchy of any organization is having problems keeping the flock in line.  The book is quite interesting, containing a vast amount of information, including a lot which seems to argue against Jenkin's point.  I don't know whether to congratulate him to have the honesty to include it or to suppose that he has completely failed to understand how others might see it.  Jenkins is attempting to gain momentum from the various "liberation" movements that have arisen in the wake of the Civil Rights movement that became prominent in the 1950s.   To this end, he employs the tried and true propaganda technique of beginning history at a point where one's own side can be made to look like an injured innocent, i.e., the anti-Catholicism of nativists and Know-Nothings.  If he really wants to trace the history of Protestant/Catholic conflict, he needs to go back to the Reformation at least.  It would also be appropriate to mention the Vatican's anti-Americanism during the same period; many churches were offended that Americans considered the people, rather than God,to be the legitimate source of political power.   In any case, it is irrelevant, since the book largely ignores the unfortunately still extant strains of real anti-Catholic prejudice, such as the fundamentalist Protestant groups who regard the Pope as the anti-Christ. Jenkins's real foe is people whose argument with the Catholic Church is not really religious but social.  Representatives of the Church have often argued that it is their duty to enter into debates of public legislation and morality and I can't disapprove of the participation of any citizen in public debates.   They all enter at the same level, however, and those who participate in the brawl of public debate (excuse me, the marketplace of ideas) must expect sometimes very harsh criticism, although I shall always hope, often in vain, for a level of civility and honest consideration of differing viewpoints.  Jenkins feels that the Church should be accorded special reverence by all; he seems to suggest that any criticism borders on bigotry.  The Church should be permitted to make strongly worded pronouncements without risking strongly worded retorts.   To Jenkins, any dispute between the Church and any other group, including dissenting Catholics, is proof of anti-Catholic prejudice.  He would probably deny this and attempts at several points to explain the difference between prejudice/bigotry and acceptable dissent, but the main difference seems to be that acceptable dissent is removed in time and place.  Jenkins mentions that the Masons were originally welcoming to Catholics, but after what he admits to be a campaign of slander and libel by the Church hierarchs, became decidely less friendly.  Jenkins blames the Masons for the ill-will, even though he admits that the Church threw the first rhetorical punch.   In many ways, Jenkins does as much as any "No-Nothing" to argue that "real" Catholics are unable to live in a secular, multireligious society.  It is in his discussion of homosexual issues that this becomes most clear.   I share Jenkins' outrage at the invasion of St. Patrick's Cathedral by Act-Up, but for the most part he discusses the incident as if the police refused their assistance and society at large applauded; he does eventually admit that even many gay activists were appalled.  I have enough sympathy for the points that Jenkins raises about the problems of expecting rapid change with regard to a long-standing and widespread condemnation of homosexually that I would expect to be charged with homophobia.  As an outsider, I would not presume to tell the Church how to regard homosexuality or insist that they sanctify gay marriages.   At the same time, if the church is going to condemn gays as hell-bound and attempt to frustrate their efforts to reach an accomodation with the larger society, it is ridiculous for him to take umbrage at non-violent complaints.     Jenkins completely misses the point in his discussion on pedophilia.   The issue for most people is less that some priests are pedophiles than the apparent inability of the Church to deal with the issue.  People being what they are, this has presumably been an organizational problem for more than 1500 years, yet the Church seems baffled.   Some people do see this as an opportunity to beat the Church and its policy of celibacy over the head, but in fact civil authorities have in the past tried to spare the Church embarrassment by declining to prosecute and trusting the Church to deal with erring priests.   Jenkins ignores this and complains that the organizational strength of the church makes it a tempting target for grandstanding prosecutors, forgetting that this is the very reason that the problems were concealed for so long.  The Church is paying more for its own failure to deal with the problem than for the individual transgressions of certain priests 
 I had high hopes for this volume- but like many other reviewers, I was dimayed by the author's profound ignorance or economics, and even more profound ignorance of history. He has the British Left's rabid hatred of Maggie Thatcher, and consequently he is blind to the tremendous economic resurgence of Great Britain under her leadership. Similarly, his analysis of fiscal policies under Reagan consists mainly of reciting old charges of "voodoo economics", and so he blames tax cuts for deficits- instead of actually looking at the record, and discovering that US tax receipts actually increased after the '84 tax reform.  The remainder of the book consists in large part of assorted bits of nonsense found in government and academia, most of it of little consequence. There are some gems buried in their as well, but the bulk of the book is so taken with the author's personal predjudices and ignorance that I can't recommend it 
 this is a very basic book, if you are just starting with MindStorms or if you are 12 years old, then you'll like it. Hackers, dont think about getting it 
 Sounds fine on my CD player, but it (a) completely freezes up my desktop and (b) has distorted playback in iTunes and WMP on my laptop.  Also sounds like crap when I try to rip it for use on my iPod.  Conclusion: don't even bother.    [... 
 Many have seen this movie on TV many times. For a B-movie it is great fun and interesting to watch. No extras on the DVD. I wish they did add something from behind the scenes, etc 
 I was hoping to find new information here that I did not find off the internet from websites like Nappturality, Motown girl, and other nappy sites. I have been transitioning for 4 months. I have relaxed my hair for most of my life. I must be honest, it makes me think that I could have written this book. It is nothing more than a pamphlet with an advertising plug to the writers' website to buy products. Much too expensive for the "information" provided. I could have given it 1 star but I do not have the heart. 
 Hey! I gave Elizbeth Royte's book 5 stars (not 2)! The secret wonders she works in this book! Elizabeth Royte is a transformative writer, an unassuming genius who wings hers way over the jellied mundane, putrefyingly prosaic, definitively overlooked, commonly rejected stuff on earth, your dear garbage. She takes us on a grand reverse journey to rejected digesters and backs up to smelly sodden transfer stations, and we are magically rewound, swathed in strange new currents. I was surprised by my own puddled reflection, puzzling in an oily rainbow shimmer. When she asked, What can we recover? What can be reclaimed? Who will redeem the Land? I wanted to answer her Powerful questions. 
 I admit it. I bought this one because I think Sandra Bullock is beautiful and she looked nice on the box. I need not have bothered. She is a very minor character with minimal screen time. She does well in her few moments but that is not enough to make this a "good show".  The story revolves around a Madison Avenue type who thinks he has a divine mission to found a new religion. He sets about hsi task with all of the market research tools at his disposal and manages to fleece his flock of much of their disposable income. Near the end, he begins to see the light and reforms himself.  There are a few brief moments of laughter, a few moments of Sandra in briefs but the the redeeming moments are all too brief 
 I thought I'd try this book because I enjoyed both of the films about Ripley. But take away the acting of Matt Damon and John Malkovich and Ripley loses his depth as a fascinatingly ambiguous amoralist, and turns into just a bore in a dressing gown who happens to kill a lot of people. Furthermore, Highsmith seems to have only one literary trick up her sleeve: describe a bunch of horrific acts in deadpan, Hemingwayesque prose so that your reader can shiver and marvel at the incongruity of it all. Well, ho hum 
 I purchased this book as a read aloud for my two oldest children.  I liked the story but the chapters were way too long.  My children kept asking, "how many more pages?" 
 what are you all on about?, i didn't enjoy this at all, it had interesting moments, sure if you're a fan of Neve Campbell it's worth a watch, but otherwise, forget it. stick to "Wild Things", and I don't mean literall 
 Unfortunately Mr. Gould is teaching tennis methods on this DVD that have been completely debunked over the past 5 years.  All the top tennis academies now teach the Oscar Wegner method of an open stance, not running with the racquet back, and moving naturally to the ball.  All professional tennis players also use the Wegner method and not the Gould method. I strongly discourage any parent from using this DVD to teach their children the modern game of tennis 
 If we follow Ledeen off the Machiavellian cliff, what is left of the dream of the Founding Fathers for us to defend? This book illustrates one thing that is very important: in times of stress, normally intelligent people lose their sense of reason and let partisanship, xenophobia, or even megalomania rule their thoughts. Ledeen tells us to pursue the very course our forefathers rejected when they founded the USA, and he says it without the slightest trace of irony. Unfortunately for Ledeen, he negates his own title, for if we follow his prescription, those who "hate our freedoms" have already won by causing errant and misguided patriots to subvert the framework which supported those freedoms. Unfortunately for all of us, Ledeen has been taken seriously and literally by the Bush administration. Laws, Constitution, and even Geneva conventions are ignored because the end supposedly justifies the means. History says otherwise. Ledeen apparently believes that his book represents the moment in which historical patterns no longer apply to our world. Historians, if there are any left, will tell us whether he was right.  Shooshi 
 Superficial, biased, gossipy.  All in all, an unworthy book.  For a good read on TR, the 2 volume set by Morris is excellent 
 I'm very disappointed with this book.  It touches on some concepts that could be useful but there is absolutely nothing in this book a PHP programmer can put to use right away.  I've built several web sites using PHP/MySQL and there is not one single thing in this book useful to me.  The book is mainly a survey of concepts, NOT an advanced programming guide.  Nothing in this book is fleshed out completely enough to actually begin using it in programming your website.   If you want to actually use any of the ideas in the book, you will have to find a better source of information and documentation for the particular idea or technology.  For example, the book has a decent introduction to the Smarty template system but not enough info to actually start using it effectively.  There are no performance or feature comparisons between Smarty and other template systems so I'm not even sure how you're supposed to decide if Smarty is right for you (the author merely mentions that Smarty is popular, not why you should or should not use Smarty).  Another example: the book talks about three different load generators and gives examples of their use (about 1.5 pages each) but definitely not enough details to begin using any of them.  The only thing of value I got from this book is a conceptual understanding of reverse proxies.  Of course, if you actually want to implement a reverse proxy yourself, you're going to need a lot more information than you'll find in this book.  I gave this book two stars instead of one because it is a halfway decent survey.  The title, however, is totally inappropriate.  It has nothing to do with advanced PHP programming.  Instead, the title should be, "Shallow Survey of Concepts and Tools Related to PHP and Web Development" 
 OK, so the title track is a great song, cannons and all, and Inject the Venom and Put the Finger on You are both decent rockers. The rest, however, is the sign of a once-good band now simply sticking to the formula that brought them success. Consider the following: Virtually every song on For Those about to Rock We Salute You is a midtempo heavy rocker about sex. Virtually every song on Back in Black was a midtempo heavy rocker about sex. Same with Highway to Hell, and Powerage, and Let There Be Rock, and... well, pretty much every AC/DC album. But while those albums were great, this one sucks. Just look at some of the cliched song titles: Let's Get It Up, Evil Walks, Spellbound.. 
 thats exactly how this album feels! you know, some irish songs and influences are good, but this is ridiculous. when 95% of your lyrical content is irish at least keep it interesting.(spicy mchaggis jig??? what the....?) so i say if your even interested in this cd or something 95% irish, get drunken lullabies or swagger by flogging molly instead, if you dont already have them. id also recommend the new murphys cd "the warriors code" if you want faster irish music done good. i give it 2 stars because its not nearly as bad as some of the other stuff out there. oh yeah rocky road to dublin kicks arse....thats about the only reason to even put this cd on. easily the worst DKM albu 
 As mentioned in another review, stolen scenes from Runaway Train. Not just clips, but entire scenes. Also the plane crash scene from Cliffhanger. Still worth $3 - $4 for a DVD just for the other action 
 "Authorized" is misleading ---This book is an "authorized" training material, which signifies that it covers the content of the relevant certification exams.  The accuracy and delivery of the content, however, have not necessarily been reviewed or approved by the certifying agencies.    A review of the Table of Contents (16 pages worth) leads one to believe this book (800+ pages worth) will cover it all and with great detail.  From there to Chapter 4 (where I decided the book wasn't worth completing), it was mostly downhill.  Here are some examples of what I found:  - terms not introduced or not introduced at the first use, and/or not identified in the glossary - layout and delivery of information difficult to follow, repetitious of some information, while not including other pertinent information - errors (bandwidth of Cat 5e cable listed at 200 Mbps (Table 1-5, pg 11) and at 100 Mbps (Table 4-2, pg 101)) - errors (pg 24: Chapter 1 test question # 4 directs to Table 1-2 rather than Table 1-3 to reference for answering)  - why?! (includes text, tables and figures with details on voltage/plugs/etc. used by other countries, yet is incomplete on the products used in the US)   - errors (pp 83-84: identifies the "minimum" bend radius for Cat5 to be 1 inch, while Figure 3-7 depicts the diameter) - errors (pg 85: last paragraph refers to Figures 3-11 and 3-12, rather than Figures 3-9 and 3-10) - errors (pg 93: Answer #1 is identified as "C, User Training Guide", but the answer text expands on "D, Wire Chart".   I highly recommend persons desiring the CompTIA HTI+ and/or CEDIA Installer I certifications, as well as those wishing to simply increase their knowledge base, look elsewhere for study materials.    Some of the information provided in this book may truly be of value (i.e. accurate and complete), however, with all the errors I've found, I am unable to rely on this book as a good resource.  
 I am a big Percy Blakeney/Scarlet Pimpernel fan and have read Orczy's book at least 3 times.  Based on the strength of a customer review on this webpage, I purchased the boxed DVD edition, featuring Richard E. Grant & Elizabeth McGovern.  The scripts were written by Richard Carpenter.    I was VERY DISAPPOINTED by this screen version of the story.  I do NOT recommend it to any true Percy fan.  I have viewed 3 movie versions of the Scarlet Pimpernel, and this one is by far the worst.  Perhaps screen-writer Carpenter never read the book; perhaps he simply decided to take ENORMOUS LICENSE with the characters.  In either event, the script eliminated much of what was delightful about Orczy's Percy and turned Marguerite into a mild-mannered wimp without the wit or resources to save herself from her own stupid decisions.  Even worse, Marguerite was constantly in need of being rescued by her husband or, ironically, her former lover/the series villain, Chauvelin.  Here are some reasons for my conclusions:    Percy Blakeney, whom Orczy described in her book as the "master of disguise" never ONCE dons a disguise in this movie series (unless you consider wrapping a black scarf around the lower face a disguise).  And **HELLO!!** wouldn't the French be a tad bit suspicious of 3 black-cloaked, black-masked figures strutting around the streets of Paris in broad daylight?  (The French certainly arrested other characters for less!)  These scenes were so contrived, they were painful.  And yes, while it was certainly clever to have Percy escape ala James-Bond gadgetry -- this contrivance negated Orczy's portrayal of Percy as a man whose WIT was his first and primary weapon for defense and escape.  In fact, I found Percy (in this DVD collection) to be more fond of slicing and dicing enemies, than of using his unmatched cunning to save himself and his compatriots.  This twist on Percy was truly, truly disappointing -- the author must be turning in her grave.  As for the romance in Orczy's story...  Neither the actor nor the screen-writer were EVER able to convince me that Percy was the kind of man whom a woman (or a nation) could adore.  Richard E. Grant portrayed Percy as cold & verbally abusive to Marguerite.  Percy ridicules her publically several times -- and Marguerite's dialogue is written so that she never quite "gives" as good as she gets.    But Marguerite's dialogue is not the point.  THE POINT is that Percy, in the book, was a tormented man who loved a wife whome he feared he could not trust.  Never once did Grant's acting convey such breadth; his verbal sniping (as written and acted) was cruel and self-aggrandizing.  Even when Percy is supposed to be "play-acting" this ridicule of Marguerite in DVD #3 to set up a plot element later in the story, the contempt in the dialogue, as delivered by Grant, felt very REAL.  Screen-writer Carpenter's rendition of the so-called "romance" in this movie version touches the very uncomfortable theme of emotional abuse, especially through Grant's interpretation of the dialogue.  Rather than delivering his lines with subtlety (a nod to his hidden feelings of affection for his wife), Grant's Percy most often comes across as a high-handed male autocrat who expects Marguerite to submit meekly to his rule.  While this type of husband/wife relationship may have been historically accurate in 18th Century Britain, I do not believe that the Percy of Orczy's book would have handled himself in this way.  Indeed, Percy was supposed to be the consummate gentleman underneath all the frippery.  And he was supposed to be genuinely in love with his wife.  One of the rare, potentially romantic moments in DVD #1 was completely bungled by both leading actors.  Grant's one-liner about Marguerite being his "life" is delivered with such unbelievable dispassion that it borders on mockery.  (And please:  Marguerite's dimwitted mutterings about unrequited love at this crucial point in the plot -- when Percy is accusing her of complicity in a French family's murder -- was INSULTING to every woman of intelligence in the audience! I just wanted to throttle actress McGovern AND the screenwriter.)  Yes, yes, the original book hinged on this ongoing misunderstanding in the Blakeneys' marriage, but the dialogue could have been written and acted much better.  But if you don't consider the lack of plausible romantic elements a good reason to avoid this series, read on.  The problems with this verison of Orczy's Pimpernel go far beyond the love story.  For starters, Percy is often unsympathetic as a human being:  in addition to sniping at his wife and behaving in court like a smart-alecky prig, he shows a dearth of compassion at the death of his loyal lieutenant, Lord Anthony Dewhurst.  When Dewhurst is murdered by Chauvelin (in cold blood, I might add), Grant (and the scriptwriter) devote exactly 3 seconds to grief in DVD #1.  Grant cavalierly delivers the following dialogue: "Well, Tony knew the risks."  (And this Pimpernel is supposed to be a hero whom a nation adores?  Whom 20+ young British hotbloods would give up their LIVES for?! Sorry.  Didn't buy it.)  If Percy's casting was bad, Marguerite's was even worse.  In the book, Orczy's Marguerite was a flamboyant French actress, full of life and passion & hopelessly in love with a husband who, she believes in despair, no longer loves her.    In this DVD collection, Elizabeth McGovern most often appears as a frumpy hausfrau rather than a sparkling coquette.  McGovern played Marguerite without wit or common sense, & Carpenter's script didn't help.  For example:  Marguerite (a bourgeois who should have known better) tries to pass herself off at the gates of Paris as a seamstress.  Five seconds later, her lily-white, uncallused hands are inspected by the captain of the guard, and she is hauled off to prison.  Carpenter didn't even let Marguerite's character -- the consummate actress -- PROTEST this treatment, much less run, struggle, or attempt to bluff her way out of her predicament.  Marguerite simply walks off between her guards!!  (::groan::)  In DVD #2, she sits meekly in a convent, waiting for Madame Guillotine's troops to discover her and drag her away.  In DVD #3, she spies on 2 characters, learning the double-identity of the villain.  The villain leaves, but the sidekick remains; several minutes later, Marguerite returns from a chat with Percy to rummage through the villain's belongings.  At this point, neither the actress nor the screenwriter allow Marguerite the common sense to first SEARCH THE AREA FOR THE SIDEKICK to make sure that her snooping goes unobserved.  Naturally, this plot contrivance leads to Marguerite's capture later.  ::double groan::  I could go on and on about the characterization of Marguerite as a stupid female, but I'm sure you get the point.  And now you're probably wondering if there is ANYTHING to commend you to this series.  Well, yes, to be fair, there is:  Martin Shaw, who was cast as Chauvelin.    Shaw portrayed Chauvelin as a real human being with passions, prejudices, longings and yes, moments of real malice.  He also had occasional moments of nobility.  He gave the only consistent performance of real depth in this series.  Even in the scenes where Percy completely humiliated Chauvelin, either by word or by sword, Chauvelin somehow remained sympathetic, which, by contrast, left Percy either looking over-the-top arrogant or a tad bit cruel.  In general, the worst storyline of this series is on DVD #2.  MADAME GUILLOTINE has enough plot contrivances to gag an ox.  The 3rd DVD, THE KIDNAPPED KING, is by far the best of the series -- but, sadly, that isn't saying much.    If you're a glutton for punishment and you really MUST purchase this series, I recommend that you amuse yourself by watching the REALLY BAD ACTING of the extras in the crowd scenes (especially on DVD #1).  However, if you want to watch a REALLY GOOD version of the Scarlet Pimpernel, one that is faithful to Orczy's novel, view the 1980s version that stars Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour.  Andrews is comical AND heroic -- a man to fall in love with.  Seymour is a spunky, resourceful heroine that will make audiences cheer.  You might also enjoy the Leslie Howard version, with beautiful Merle Oberon as Marguerite, which was released in 1935.  Both actors do a credible job with Orczy's characters, and the script is faithful to her book.    Happy viewing 
 After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try Skeleton Man as my first Hillerman novel.  Unfortunately, I'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it.    I read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before, but I find Hillerman's writing style to be very choppy and awkward.  I find I have to re-read sentences to catch the meaning because it just doesn't flow smoothly.     Here's an example of one paragraph that I opened to randomly:  "Getting this ceremonial procession from Tuve's village on Second Mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings, the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs, and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited.  By the time Tuve had brought them to the Hopi shrine at the tribe's cliff-bottom salt deposits, Joanna Craig had looked at her watch three times that Chee had noticed.  Navajo fashion, he hadn't glanced at his own.  Tuve would finish when he finished."  It's like he talks in short cuts that you're expected to follow. When I'm reading this book, my mind is wandering all over the place because the text doesn't draw me in.  I'm glad he has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them 
 I was very disappointed when I ran across this book - although it looks like it has lots of really great and hard-to-find information, there are no sources credited for where the info came from, where the drawings are from or anything.  Sadly that makes it useless to me in pursuit of replication of authentic medival clothing.  If only the author had annotated it.. 
 Pat Conroy's first literary effort does provide us with far too brief glances of the writer he would become with his future efforts like The Lords of Discipline and Prince of Tides. The Boo is a biography of an Assistant Commandant of The Citadel when Conroy was enrolled at the South Carolina military college. The book does too little in the way of actual factualizations of Lt. Colonel Courvoisie's life, but chooses instead to focus on descriptions of the large amounts of memorabilia and paperwork that The Boo was involved in during his term at The Citadel.     While it is clear that Colonel Courvoisie was a fascinating individual and worthy of the respect Conroy and others have given him, the God-like status he is provided is a bit much to swallow.     I'm glad Conroy left the biogrsphy format behind and focused his future efforts on fiction. His later books are a wonderful and significant contribution to the literary world. This one can be left behind 
 Don't even think about it 
 Got the product. In 2 minutes it wasn't working. Mattel is sending me a new one. The basically tell you to cut the mic so it can't be used and toss it and they send you a new one. I thought it was a sad waste of resources that they don't look to recycle the product 
 cocorosie sucks.  They can't sing.  And they really piss me off using the N word in their Jesus Loves Me song.  
 I was so excited about this bag but it was a huge disappointment.  The description clearly indicates WATERPROOF, but in fact it is mostly water RESISTANT, an 8 on a scale of 1-10 according to the box.  and since our travel coincided with several rain storms, this was a very important differentiation! the straps for the 'net' are extremely unmanageable and there are several key elements missing from the instructions.  having never used a roof top cargo bag before, this presented quite an obstacle for me.  there are loops through which you send the straps for the net that holds the bag down, the instructions make no mention of them, do you loop the strap through before or after you loop it through the luggage rack?  does it make a difference?  it took me 45 minutes just to get the thing attached to my roof due to trial and error (not counting loading time). the clips themselves are very poor construction, one of them broke upon tightening and had to be makeshift tied instead. the straps also do not tighten very easily, you have to feed the straps through the clips and then keep moving the clips back and forth until you get it to the length you want. the stitching also started ripping when trying to close the very stubborn zipper.  the bag was not overstuffed. I cannot recommend this product 
 I was hoping this book would have more to offer. Its a fun read to look at all the various travel locations, but it didn't offer much at all in terms of helpful advice. It's more like a travel book than anything else and it actually caters more to readers in a high income bracket than to the average bride looking to plan a wedding her guests could reasonably attend 
 The author attempts to overwhelm the reader with endless details from anthropology, history, sociology, psychology, political theory, etc. and endless analysis of factors to discuss the relation of gender and war--all in the service of the white male patriarchal academic establishment.    Meanwhile, under "matriarchies," he has two entries:  "lack of evidence...[and] rhesus monkeys."  He conveniently assumes that matriarchies would have been the mirror image of patriarchies, i.e., amazonian matriarchies, which allows him to exclude discussion of actual matriarchies--at least one of which still persists in the United States today--the Iroquois.  The reader never learns that indeed there were such matriarchies as the Iroquois, where the mothers of the tribe were empowered to make the decision about whether the males would conduct war.  See Doug George-Kanentioo, Iroquois Culture & Commentary (New Mexico:  Clear Light Publishers, 2000).  Nor does the reader learn that there are scholars such as Ifi Amadiume, a Professor at Dartmouth College, who has demonstrated the existence of African matriarchies in many works, especially African Matriarchal Foundations (London:  Karnak House, 1987).

 I did not find this book as helpful as I was hoping. First, and most importantly, I needed more examples. There was only one and it was a service organization and I needed to see an example of a manufacturing organization where the target customer was not so geographically limited. Also, I found that the way the book is organized was difficult. I felt the book was more oriented toward helping someone sort out their thoughts and feelings about starting a business than it was focused on actually structuring and writing a business plan. What I actually need are the hard, factual mechanics of writing a business plan and I did not find it to my satisfaction in this book 
 I read this book as a requirement for a class in eschatology in seminary. Pentecost block-quotes other authors for about 60 percent of his text, at which point he could've just provided a bibliography. There is little originality in thought here. Pentecost surveys the narrow world of premillenial dispensationalism and says anyone who disagrees with his viewpoint does not take the text "literally" and ignores the "clear, plain meaning of scripture." But his hermeneutic is a bit inconsistent. He insists that various parts of the apocalyptic imagery presented in Revelation, Daniel and other parts of the Bible must be taken literally.   But he then turns around and says the odd beasts in the Revelation are figurative. Okay...who's not being "literal" here?  Like too many evangelical theologians, Pentecost has no concept of how apocalyptic worked in the Second Temple period. I would imagine that, having translated the Testaments of the XII Patriarchs, I've done more background work than he did in the area (unless reading the notes in the Scofield Bible counts).  Instead, he spends all of his time demonizing those blasted amillenialists. An enormous waste of time and energy.  Then again, the book is almost 600 pages long, and uneducated people are always impressed when they see you reading something large. But for my money, you could learn more about how to live like Christ in the light of his imminent coming (the point of eschatology) by reading an even bigger book you probably already own: the yellow one with restaurant listings 
 I found this magazine to be helpful for an introduction to advanced computing.  That's about it.  This mag seems to be biased towards certain products & manufacturers.  They neglected to open my eyes wider.  The reviews/articles that are published seem to favor big money companies (microsoft, dell, etc). They don't give credit to smaller, better, less-well-known companies and technologies.  All the info is pretty basic for intro users, but if that's what you are interested in... then this is a great non-comlicated publication 
 What a disappointment. Every single character in this film is depressed, mentally ill, and self-absorbed. No one is sane or sympathetic. Therefore, there's no one to identify with or root for. No one gets better or grows as a person. So what's the point? Annette Benning gives a strong performance, but her character is vapid and self-pitying. Not worth two hours of your life 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 Peters can write and the book is mostly readable if you can get past the silliness. In the Amelia Peabody books Peters takes the rediculous and creates fantastic, entertaining and humorous literary concoctions.  Not so in Summer of the Dragon. I'm surprised she would allow these older books to be published under the same name as the Peabody series 
 While this book may be helpful to children who are seen as "special" or "crippled," I would never recommend it, because of the title,  which is bad as "The Nig**er Lamb" would be. Get it?  I'm an advocate for people with disabilities, the preferred term, and can assure you that a book called "crippled" and terms like "special" will have the opposite of the intended result and could cause  children to be perceived even more as "special" instead of different but equal 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 It doesn't fit - I got my size.  I don't know why it doesn't fit but I'm not taking all the time to send it back.  Both bras I got didn't fit.  Sigh 
 This is an utter failure as a romantic comedy. It is not romantic, nor is it a comedy. The fact that anyone would choose a sullen Matt Dillon over the obviously desirable Vincent D'Onofrio is not to be believed. It is only because of Vincent that I gave it 2 stars for the 6 or 8 minutes he appears in the movie and brings it to life. Vince is always excellent and compelling. He could have made something of the title role, but it was not to be. The audience's loss, I fear 
 I ordered this item thinking that it would be useful when on the road in hotel rooms to light up my work area.  WRONG !!  The light is so DIM, the only thing it might be good for is a night light! This lamp is a good idea, but much too weak to be of any help 
 Taken from the premise that this book will likely just be picked up by fans who already know much of the Floyd story, I'm puzzled about what the author was trying to achieve.  There's no real revelations here, nothing that hasn't been said or published before.  In fact, looking at the sources he draws from, it's primarily a collection of previously published works and even a few DVD's!  My - what strenuous research Mr. Harris must have done.  Unless you're completely new to the material, this book will do very little to help further your knowledge of the subject.  It appears the author just cobbled together a bunch of already known facts and anicdotes in an attempt to make a few bucks off a great creative work that has stood the test of time.  Save your money 
 I was drawn to the story because the horse and the family needed healing on many levels.  I wanted to know more about how the horse and teenager were rehabilitated.  Tom Booker, a.k.a. the Horse Whisperer, was an appealing character because he was a very balanced person.  It was his role to be the healer.  He had his wounds, but used them intuitively to help others.  The author portrayed him as a spiritual sort of guy.  Suddenly, we are led to believe that he has an epiphany:  He needs Annie! Unfortunately, their mutual desire was portrayed on a superficial level.  Tom kept remembering her eyes, her smile, etc.  This was teenage crush material; not at all in keeping with his stature or implied integrety.  Furthermore, without giving the ending of the book away, Tom's final decision was totally unbelievable to me, considering the fact that he'd earned the teenage girl's trust.  Just what she needed, more fodder for Post-Traumatic Stress disorder!    The book begins in a promising way, especially when Tom comes on the scene.  However, the ending just didn't live up to my expectations.  I skipped the sex scenes and think the main characters would have been a little better off if they had, too!  
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 This book is ridiculously myopic and ignorant at best, extremely racist at worst.    If you are intelligent enough to realize that word "racism" applies to all races, then you don't need this book.  If, however, you think that the only people who are racist are whites, make sure you pick this book up to for your propaganda horse-blinders.  Simply because the book is well written does not make it true.  If the author states something as fact, don't buy into it.  If the author cites a source, check out the source; it will be, without a doubt, written by someone who shares the exact same mendacious views (Who's parroting now?).  Citing a source that is without any genuinely academic purpose does not create a strong foundation for supporting an already weak hypothesis.  Even the author, within the first 10 pages, admits that what she is trying to prove is "invisible", and therefore that much more insidious.  In other words, the department of "I just pulled these stats, findings, thoughts, citations, and facts out of my rear" is alive and well within this book.    If you read this book with an open-mind, and you haven't already been tainted by one side or the other, you'll see more hypocrisy in this book than a book titled "Why I Love and Practice Democracy" written by Joseph Stalin.  Within the first two chapters you'll find yourself wanting to debate the author, calling her out on her BS, and asking her why there aren't inter-connected footnotes that chronicle her contradictions.  If I could give it zero stars, I would.  The book does nothing but stoke the coals of racial tensions, persuading those who believe in "The Man" and "The System" to dig in their heels with their misguided and misinformed positions 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 If you loved the Back to the Future trilogy and, generally speaking, time traveling extravaganzas on the silver screen... simply forget about buying this DVD. All being well it would make you feel like a total idiot for the first half of the movie, while you try to figure out all the "time-traveling science" you've been taught so far, then space you out close to the end, leaving you totally speechless. This is not good, simply because the producers and the writers probably went crazy themselves trying to emulate the real time-traveling pros, while winding up with some abrubt, nonsense end of the movie, with absolutely no sci-fi logic at all: they simply had to eventually stop shooting, so they just thought any happy ending would have done the trick, no matter the time differences and the numberless loose ends still untied in the plot. Not a sci-fi movie and not a romantic story either: look elsewhere for any of these two types of movie 
 they make bold statements and present theory as fact. very intriguing on the surface, but frankly irritating in the lack of scientific process when examined closely.  its the "prophesy" of their predictions that we are all interested in, i would imagine, and that was sufficiently vague to satisfy all 
 I haven't received the mug yet, but the shipping & handling fee for this coffee mub was $9.00;  nearly half of the cost of the mug itself.  Why was it so high?  If amazon.com's shipping and handling fees are customarily this high, I will not be using your website any further.                                   Joyce Dea 
 It's rare that I don't finish a book.  I realized after getting 1/3 of the way through it that I just couldn't get interested in the characters. Took it back to the library. A friend of mine who also reads a lot had the same experience. Harris' other books were much better 
 I am returning this book. I have not read it, I am angry the book has 81 pages , I am not sure it is an entire book. You had the audacity to charge me $ 4.98 when on the face of this book it is marked $2.99. If that is the way you do business, I don't want to do business with you .I feel cheated and disappointed 
 Not my cup a tea. Poor sound and average picture. Just for Excalibur freaks...?! 
 Didn't meet my needs at all. Badly written and a bit outdated. Actually, I just gave it one star to balance out the so obviously fake reviews given in 2000. What, each reviewer has never reviewed anything else before or since writing a review for this book? Hmmm, I wonder if maybe the author or publisher had something to do with that. 
 We were very disappointed, upon opening the package, to see how small the glasses are.  I was concerned about this when I purchased them, but could find no info on size (and the seller is very careful to not show them near anything else that might give you a hint as to how small they are (2 inches in diameter at the largest point and only 4 1/4 inches tall; I can hide the entire glass in my closed fist) 
 "Saints, Saviors, and Sinners" is another meek attempt by ESPN/Disney to use their brand name in an effort to coerce the buyer into purchasing something, simply because the ESPN name is on it.  I found the book to be lacking in content, and uninteresting overall.  I received the book as a Christmas gift in 2003, and have read about six pages in it.  Certainly not worth the $40.00 cover price.  If you want a decent book profiling sportsmen, pick up one of Sports Illustrated's year-end books. 
 I'm a huge dylan fan - and collector  (I have around 120 or so of his albums, bootlegs, shows etc.). This is one of his worst ever - if not The worst - the only redeeming feature - the singing is not bad - even good on afew tracks. Docendo Discimus is dead right - spot on criticism - I could/t have said it better myself - so I won't try. anyone, IMH, who gives this album more than 3 stars is of his rocker.. 
 This is a relatively short book covering 2500 years of history. Unfortunately, rather than giving us a good overview of the different periods and the main players, the writers fill the book with names and towns that confuse the reader and make it difficult to follow.  I was very disappointed 
 It was simply to frustrating a read, bear in mind that I've read all the 8 other books. Now I didn't mind Mr. Goodkind dabbling with philosophy in Faith of the Fallen, as long as it supported the plot.   Sadly this book is philosophical propaganda disguised as a fantasy book. The universe being used as a vehicle to prove Mr. Goodkind's pseudo intellectual philosophies.   A character like Richard simply disgusts me now. From being a boy with strong beliefs, he has been molded into a righteous tyrant, who enforces his beliefs upon everybody and everything. Its sad to see.   No. I really recommend anyone to stay clear of this book, its not worth the read. Its an insult to the reader, with endless monotonies and weak philosophy 
 Does anyone even care that the "Author" John Miller, formerly of ABC's 20/20 and then the head of counterterrorism for the LAPD, is currently the Assistant Director of Public Affairs for the FBI in the BUSH regime...I mean...Administration.  This book is Propaganda. Period 
 I've heard about this fashion photographer so when I bought his book, I expected models and beautiful pictures. The book was over 100 pages long but half of them were blank! Also, many of the pictures are odd, like a person, naked in blue paint. There was another pictures of a finger in red powder. The best picture is the cover and that's it. If you're expecting models and designer clothes, this is not the book for you.  
 Although an interesting read, it sure as hell wasn't worth the price! This little book should have donated as a side dish. I guess you could say we got screwed, Jack!  I can hear Hunter laughing in hell right now... 
 This book is very light for those who are engaged in Science of the Mind or Louise Hay's readings. It doesn't say anything new to what we already know. I wouldn't recommend buying it. 
 Its a shame when a band changes tact for the worse, but I cant help but give them credit for trying, what do you do when you've released 5 or 6 albums/ep's all along the same line and you start to get a touch bored with the style you've honed to perfection, you go in to the studio with a different producer and you experiment, this one "I think" fizzed and died soon after conception.  you can only hope that the next one rises from the bland ashes of this release 
 I never reveived this book.  The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it.  Who do I need to contact????? 
 $.50 is half a buck too much.  This is not is hindsight.  I read it  long ago and it made no sense then.  Try Odom instead 
 John Dunning's "Booked to Die" was a New York Times best seller, and also won the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award.  It is one in his series of Denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective Cliff Janeway.  Dunning, who lives in Denver, Colorado,owned the Old Algonquin Bookstore in Denver for many years, and "Booked to Die," (duh!) is set in the world of rare and collectible books.  I really found it an interesting world to enter, and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done.  But do I believe the designated villain, a book dealer, really would have killed?  Not on your life.  And do I believe anyone would kill over some valuable books?  Not on your life.  Of course, I realize that in the current world, it must require great imagination to write a mystery that doesn't feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places; still, one of the first requirements of a mystery, for me at least, is at least temporary believability.  Dunning writes well, he does well by Denver, and, as previously noted, the book trade. He's a thorough-going professional, and the story keeps trucking along, rented U-Haul and all.  As, "I drove south, into the coming snowstorm.  I thought about the U-Haul truck and the mileage that Bobby Westfall had racked up.  I thought about Greenwald and the screwed-up Ballards and the turtle-faced man.  Snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield.  The road was getting slick."  Still, the book has a paint by numbers feel to me, or rather it has no feeling, to me.  Supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard. I'd say the book didn't touch my emotions, but that wouldn't be entirely true.  It left me with a bad feeling.  Consider: the first love interest deserts Janeway without a word when he leaves the police force.  A woman who's met up with the book's actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward, keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy.  Suspicion is cast on the book's later love interest, a ploy that's been used untold times by writers better than Dunning.  And a 19-year old female character, introduced only to be killed shortly, is made a Glaswegian Scot, no less, and stuck with the given name of Elspeth Pride, known as"Pinky" by her friends. For heaven's sake, if you're giving a character only 30 pages to live, at least give her a humane name.  My yiddische grandmother, whom I loved, used to say of someone she disliked," he should live and be well."  After that came an unpoken sentence: "But not in my vicinity."  Dunning should write and be well, but not in my vicinity.    
 Ok I started reading. It was pretty interesting. Until the middle. It was kinda confusing. There were too many characters. I read back through and got it. Next, I find out the main character's brother is a killer who never get sin trouble and who's parents don't care. The reason Paul has glasses is because his brother Erik sprayed white paint into his eyes. Nice huh? And of course, his parents keep all of this a secret, telling him he looked up at the sun during an eclipse. Paul is good at soccer, so his parents care? NO. All they care about is Erik's football career. It was depressing. Then Erik steals $1,000s of dollars worth of stuff and is responsible for two murders. Guess what? His parents don't punish him! Paul finally tells the Sheriff the stuff Erik did, and finally, Erik is caught and arrested. I was disappointed, they didn't tell what kind of punishment the jerk got. The parents still don't seem to care. How abusive?! The summary seems to make it seem like a happy and silly type of book. Well, it's not. It's dark, and evil. Don't read this if you hate violence, or are under 9. I could handle it just fine because I'm a mature 11 yr. old. It may deeply disturb and depress some younger children though 
 I loved the original book "The Sherbrooke Bride".  I have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse.  The only reason I have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters.  Otherwise, this book is a complete waste of time.  If you want to be thoroughly entertained I suggest reading the first book which happens to be about Alex and Douglass.  Skip the second for Ryder's story is so-so.  I would then read Sinjun's search for love.  It is very funny and captivating.  Ms. Coulter generally writes really good books.  She should have quit while she was ahead 
 On the surface, this appears to be a strong case for Clinton.  But as you deeply analyze this book,you will find the arugemnt to support Clinton is very weak.  I saw her on the O'Reilly Factor and he also pointed out what I saw.  The author does nothing to explain: Why does she support the war in Iraq?  What would she do differently from Bush?  What will her standing be on illegal immigration?  Will she actually prosecute illegal immigrants?  What is her standing on health care?  In the words of the author, "The Lucky People get it!"  She has no clue!  The author seems more concerned about trying to promote the first woman President of teh United States rather than knowing the facts.  Now, I am not speaking out against Clinton, but I feel that a book written to support her campagin should do more express what Hillary really stands for.  The author seemed very ignorant of that.  And she shouldn't be if she is to write a book on this subject 
 This video/DVD lacks the content it claims it has.  It only covers 5 or so letters, and does not focus on the sounds.  It is pain-stakingly boring, lacks excitement and did not keep my 20 month old daughter's attention.  Even the bonus section that is supposed to teach the letters on the DVD version did not appeal to her.  Needless to say, we returned this one to the store.    I recommend Leapster's Letter Factory which has taught my daughter the sounds of the letters within 2 weeks and has a bonus interactive letter game 
    Reilly fans will probably find his latest novel to be quite a disappointment. For some reason, Reilly forsakes all the things that made his earlier books great.  Instead, this novel is a thinly disguised political statement which reveals Reilly's prejudices against various governments and religions. The plot is obviously borrowed from "The Da Vinci Code" and the characters are one-dimensional pawns whose main purpose is to verbalize Reilly's personal ideology.  For the first time in a Reilly book, I managed to finish the book out of sheer determination rather than out of any interest in the plot or characters. 
 People of all groups, ethnicities, religions, and races commit cons, steal, and such.  To paint a whole ethnic group, Gypsies (Romani folk) with the same broad brush as the few among them who commit crimes is no more valid than to call all whites "oven tenders" because of the Holocaust or call all corporate officers "embezzlers" because of Enron or to call all men as rapists because a few have done so.  These sorry characterizations merely illustrate how twisted the slanderer's own views are.    While the grain of truth is that some people of all groups might con other people, the larger truth is that all groups have their share of criminals and no group has a monopoly on virtue.    Marlock clearly has written a book that is quite racist and wrong in spite of the grain of truth that some few people are indeed criminals.    Marlock tries to cover his tail by saying that he does not mean "all" Romani folk but then he goes on to make it quite clear that means "virtually all" but can't say so, without legal liability issues.  It's pure CYA and then he goes on and on with his racist slanders.    Yes, cons do exist and this book describes many of them.  No, they are not "Gypsy crimes" but just crimes and are committed by people of all ethnicities.  Too bad he doesn't just stick to describing the crimes and never mind discussing his racial hatreds.  Marlock's agenda is clear.  If he only wanted to protect innocents from crimes, he would not focus on a single very-small group of people.  The number of Romani people in this world is miniscule compared to the number of criminals in the world so his focus on Gypsies illustrates his true agenda here is merely to demonize a tiny, relatively-defenseless group of people.  The Furer's Reichspropagandaleiter Minister Dr. Goebbels would be proud of Marlock as one of their own, I am sure.  
 I read about three-quarters of the book and had a nagging feeling that the author was not being truthful.  I then came to Amazon and read the reviews.  After that, I skimmed the rest of the book.    I'm a big fan of true survival stories, and I give the book two stars simply because I believe it took a lot for the author to survive his time in the wilderness.  However, the fact is that he is the lone survivor and the only person who knows what went on before, during and after the accident.  As mentioned in previous reviews, he has omitted the specific finding of the NTSB that found him to be the CAUSE of the accident.  There's also that disturbing discrepancy about the ELT.  Clearly, he did not remove it from under the seat, and even if he did, apparently it would not have been operational. If he's not truthful about these things, can we really believe the rest of his story?  Of course, I do believe it took a lot to survive, but, for example, did he really encounter a bear?  All in all, the major factual omissions that point to his responsibility for the accident overshadow and seriously call into question his credibility on the rest of the story.  
 this sounds terrible. doesn't look too well either. the 2005 version is all one might need,it covers it all with passion and grace. time is fair 
 Just read the previous review (about 'simplifying' the language in Jungle Book). I am reading the ORIGINAL text JB to my eight year old son (for over a week now), and he's not once indicated that the language puzzles him.  He did ask me why Mowgli uses thee and thou and wouldst while talking with the animals, but  accepted my explanation without demur.  Reminds me of the lines from an Elinor Wylie poem "Our mutable tongue is like the sea  Curled wave and shattering thunder-fit;  Dangle in strings of sand shall he  Who smooths the ripples out of it." Say it out loud, and feel what it does to your mouth and face - that's what Kipling's prose does 
 Antzcak's direction is inexplicable and the film is weighed down by a directionless, melodramatic script and technical shortcomings. The ADR (dialog overdubbing) is incompetent and terribly distracting, making the film sound like a radio drama recorded in a basement; all the more odd considering that in all other respects the project seems well-funded and professional -- great sets, superior costuming and impeccable lighting. The gorgeous cinematography is brutalized by a directorial style characterized by long, tedious dialog punctuated by frenetic, fast-cut flashback and dream sequences that contribute neither to our understanding of Chopin's character nor the events driving the plot forward. Non-sequiturs abound; Antzcak seems to have been attempting to create a mood piece to accompany the brilliant musical performances, rather than a sustained narrative. But the only moods sustained are bewilderment and boredom.  Chopin comes off as a selfish boor of a prima dona; perhaps historically acurate, but hardly compelling on screen. What does it say about this movie that, in a crucial scene where a wagon carrying Chopin nearly topples over a precipice, you find yourself rooting for the precipice?  Unlike the vastly superior Amedeus or the merely pedestrian Immortal Beloved, you learn nothing about the connection between the composer's life and his music. Antzack seems singularly uninterested in the historical signifigance of Chopin's acheivement, the nature of his talent's development, his freindship/rivalry with Liszt, or the musical environment of the day. Desire for Love actually has more in common with a film like Jules et Jim, in that it dwells on the inner dynamics of a doomed and disfunctional romance; unfortunately the characters aren't one tenth as compelling or sympathetic.  Desire for Love ends with the composer's protracted death, like Amadeus and Immortal Beloved did with Mozart and Beethoven, respectively. But it fails to evoke the tragic mood of the latter two; the film itself seems infected by a consumptive, cinematic analog of the protagonist's malaise, eating itself from within and finally wheezing to a merciful termination 
 The story was good, but a bit far-fetched.  However, the further I got into the book, the more difficult it was to actually finish it (which I eventually did).  The problem was that as the story progressed it became more and more like a trashy romance novel, making it difficult to enjoy the story itself.    Unless the author can get away from her emphasis on the childish behavior of the heroine, I doubt I would ever pick up another of her books 
 I was extremely disappointed in this "upgrade".  I had Roxio's Easy CD Creator 5 and loved it.  That product allowed you to easily arrange your music on the dics, burn it, then create a lable or insert for the disc with almost no effort.  Almost everything was intuitive.  Creator 7 is a big step back in ease of use and utility.  So they added a few new bells and whistles, so what?  The base use of this product is to make music cd's and to create inserts.  Arranging music is not as easy as it was before.  And the insert creator is so frustrating to use I don't bother.  In fact, I have continued to use Creator 5 and have simply written off the fact I paid $100 for Creator 7 - for nothing!  Now, with a computer upgrade, Creator 5 no longer works.  I don't dare try another Roxio product (just read the reviews for 7.5 and that appears to be a total waste of money).  I'll be taking my chances on ANYTHING else . . . not Roxio 
 The book was put together in an informative and easy to read way.  It's a travel log, for anyone wanting to visit the Nez Perce Trail National Park, plus it gives a summarized overview of that happened.  I loved the author's method of narrating the story of what happened, with easy to read maps and tables of information.  Her list of references was also impressive.    More detail will require further reading, but this is a starter.  What is missing from her story is what this band of renegades really was.  They were outlaws, shunned by their own Nez Perce Nation and what is also missing is the national impact of this unfortunate Indian outbreak had on our Country.  That is why I didn't rate the book higher.  It's a view into history "through rose colored glasses", which is quit in style today, but that gives the starters on history a dangerously biased view.  Real history is often painful to read about.   These Indians were not heroes. Hundreds of innocent people were murdered and the real Nez Perce almost lost their wonderful Idaho Reservation because of this War.  Congress was in a complete uproar.  They were also opposed by other Indian Nations, specifically the Bannock, Shoshone and the Crow to mention a few.  This is the story of a national disaster and tragedy.  The real heroes were often those they attacked and the horse soldiers that had to chase them.  Still, as a travelog and guide to 80% of the historic sites along the Nez Perce Trail, this book is a good starter.  I also loved the historic photographs, some of which I have not found anywhere else 
 This is not a book and I have no idea what a "sourcing fee" is.  Save your money and don't buy this item 
 After owning three other Canon cameras I am through with Canon. All my other cameras were fine. This cameras LCD broke within the first month of normal use. Never dropped! All of my other Digital cameras held up for years. Ive had two powershot s50s 1 lost and 1 stolen. Never had a problem and those were both dropped numbers of times.  This is a product defect/design flaw and Canon will not cover it under warranty. $150.00 to get it repaired and It will happen again, or you may start getting the E18 errors. This is a expensive paperweight!  Poor design. Very dissapointed. I will never buy another Canon product again 
 I would have rated this book with no star if I could. Severin was such a horrific character. Forget about the rape scene, what about the one where Severin punished Hastings for being jealous of Lady Marjorie by tying her to the ground and made her eat on the floor with his dogs in front of everyone in the dining hall????!! Is that supposed to be romantic? This is suppposed to be a romance novel, not strictly historical fiction. As such, there has to be some romantic element to the story, but I found nothing romantic whatsoever between Hastings' and severin's relationship. This is definitely the worst book I've ever read bar none! 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I don't so much mind the money I wasted on this book, it's the time that bothers me. Bill Rancic, you're fired 
 These guys are the worst. I wish they would crawl in a hole & never come out. One of the worst bands of our era 
 After the last Panasonic 4-line debacle....1 key failes in 6 months on ALL handsets YIKES! and with not having a lot of other choices on the market we were forced to buy the new edition of the Panasonic Phone. How bad could it be, we figured.  They have to have figured out how to build a decent handset buy now.  Well, the handset is probably ok, but when we took it 20 feet from the base we lost signa1. WHAT!!?  Called Panasonic and of course customer service probably had never seen the phone suggested to unplug the battery...For Heaven's Sake. Hang up, call back, next person educates me that 5.8 Ghz just means clearer signal, but range is shorter.  WTF??!  We immediately boxed this PIECE OF JUNK up and sent it back!!  Do yourself a favor, buy from a different manufacturer 
 The majority of the information in this large book is already published in this authors EODR:  Essential Oil Desk Reference.  Very little new information and thus it should have been printed in a small volume or pamphlet as an addendum to the EODR.  Much better to spend your money on the origianl and very valuable reference manual (the EODR) for all those using the Young Living Essential Oils.  Only the "true believers" and followers can or will use this current volume 
 Jim Messina has played in a some great bands. He played in the Buffalo Springfield, a group of young legends.  He also played in Poco, probably the most under-appreciated and under-rated band of the era.  With these credentials, you can put Messina's name up there with the likes of Stills, Furay, Young, Nash, Crosby, Frey and Browne.  Then he teams up with Kenny Loggins, and things get bad.  I picked up this album, expecting greatness from these two, and I simply didn't find it.  What I found was two decent tunes surrounded by silly and annoying pop.  Most songs on here have simple lyrics, and are over-produced.  I do like two songs on here.  "Till The Ends Meet" is a nice, easy tune, and Loggins sounds very nice on this one.  The other song I like is "Angry Eyes." The intro is very cool, and the singing interplay between Loggins and Messina is fun and interesting here.  The main point here is that this album does not live up to expectation in the least.  There's no folk, no country rock, no free and easy feeling to this one.  This is blatant pop-music.  If you like bouncy pop, this might be for you.  If you're looking for anything like Poco or Buffalo Springfield, you will experience a huge bummer. 
 An amusing guide to some of the rudest slang in the language.  Useful in a practical sense only if Indonesian speakers are among your closes friends, or if you're happily acquiring a potentially offensive or troublemaking  vocabulary in Bahasa Indonesia.  My Indonesian speaking friends were the  ones who got the biggest laugh out of it, but unless you've already got a  good grasp of the language and the culture, beware utilizing most of the  vocabulary in this book.. 
 Election 2004, works as a good primer to one of the most important presidential campaigns in US history. Yet Newsweek did a less than fair job in its reporting from both camps.  E-04 could have used a bit more editorial help as well as a bias check; it doesn't flow very well and overlooks important things, ignoring some downright. I do think that the criticisms directed against Kerry were slanted; I was so un-happy with Newsweek's coverage that I actually dropped my subscription. It is no coincidence either that most of the books recommended in this website along with this one are favorable to the right. To be fair, this book does report on Kerry's own unfavorable response to Newsweek' coverage; a gesture of intellectual honesty Thomas should be given credit for.   More would have been appreciated about Kerry's ill-conceived campaign and lack of message and Rove's focused, dirty and eventually successful, tricks. The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth; an obvious re-visitation of veterans against McCain in 2000 don't get the right coverage. Neither does Kerry's refusal to go against Bush's personal attacks, and failure to address the plethora of Bush's mistakes in the last two months, which decidedly cost him the election. We get very little on these points from the book. In one of the mildly insightful moments, Thomas reports that the electorate had a hard-time distinguishing Kerry's position on the war from Bush's, and consequently voted for the more stable looking candidate. This I thought was a very accurate point.   As a pet peeve, I always bought the whole Kerry's "Come-Back Kid" attitude, I even heard some of his former opponents on the right praise him for it. This book debunks it, and informs us this was just a campaign myth his people were trying to promote, which looking back on, makes sense.    One of the conclusions in E-04 was that Kerry lost partly as a result of his comments on Mary Cheney on the third debate (this is suggested and not said outright). This is just not true; although Kerry's comment was un-called for and served no purpose (I winced when he said it), I don't think that so much of the electorate was so turned off by it that they ended up voting for Bush, who ran on an anti-gay marriage platform. How much sense does that make? This assessment shows a lack of touch with the real issues on the part of Newsweek. In the following weeks the Republican camp did a lot to discredit Kerry on this point, but it is not pointed out by E-04 that Alan Keyes, a conservative republican running for the senate seat against Obama in Illinois had called Mary Cheney a "selfish hedonist" and received nary a comment from the now -conveniently- outraged Cheneys. This should have been noted in the book. I don't need Newsweek to editorialize, but I do want perspective.   Then there's Ohio. Although I'm not one for conspiracy theories there was obvious foul play in the weeks preceding and on election day; from Secretary of State Blackwell's flip-flapping on voting regulations, to the Rove people calling people in strong democratic precincts by phone and advising them to vote at the wrong places, to the lack of a voting records paper trail. Yes, there are irregularities on every election, but when all the irregularities favor the same candidate, I get a bit skeptical. Alas, this subject seemed too controversial for Newsweek.  Newsweek's coverage fails for one of these counts; they were either so engrossed in the process of reporting that they overlooked what for them, and not the electorate, was obvious, or they got so close to the campaigns they were covering that their judgment was impaired. I felt I was better informed by other sources during the election.  Campaign 2004 is at best an ok primer and at worst, a slightly biased account in need of some editorial cohesion.  
 My husband had only been gone for a handful of days when I ordered this book.  I read all the reviews here and thought that the "religious" aspect would somehow be acceptable, perhaps very helpful.  I was stopped dead in my tracks when I read the following:  "At its very nature death is demonic, and you cannot explain the demonic.  Death happens.  It is not really God's fault, nor yours, nor that of your spouse.  Death is the devil's calling card."  Are you kidding me?  I lost my husband!  He died!  In the context of searching for spiritual understanding, the idea that the devil is responsible for my beloved husband's death is absurd.  Even if the practical, therapy half of this book might be helpful...it is made null and void in my mind by allowing such utterly nonsensical and antiquated thinking to prevail.  I quote further:  "Lazarus will come storming from the tomb.  Death can't hold him back with the power of Christ on his side.  Jesus is weeping because sin has broken this world, and death is a symbol of that brokenness.  Even though he has the power to fix it, Jesus grieves."  Am I to believe that my husband's death is punishment for "original sin"?  The message here is that we, "man", are the cause of the curse of death, through sin we have brought death upon ourselves and only at the second coming of the Messiah will we be "resurrected".    If these ideas bring comfort to those who grieve the loss of a spouse, then this is a good book to read.  I write this only as a warning to those who might have different "religious", spiritual or "Christian" beliefs, or those who may be seeking spiritual guidance.  The opinions set down in this book can be very discomforting and offensive.  
 I admit I didn't have high hopes for this CD. I've had a nasty chronic insomnia for the past several years that has stumped an impressive array of doctors. It would be a mistake to really describe Dr. Thompson's Ambient Music for Sleep as music in the sense that most people think of it, and for some it might be just the thing to send them over the edge into slumber. But with me, it produced only slight drousiness 
 The Media Career Guide, by James Seguin, is unique in its intent - but that's not necessarily a good thing.  Books about résumés and interview strategies are a dime a dozen, but works focusing on making one's self an appealing candidate for a job in the many different forms of media are few and far between, perhaps for good reason.  Whether a person wants to work in TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, public relations or advertising, this book brings to light seemingly obvious tips that one might not come up with on his or her own.  However, many of the ideas in this book are SO obvious, they didn't need to be written in a book.  Strategies are outlined - step-by-step - for becoming more cognizant about improving one's skills.  The 34 preparation suggestions are divided into sections - "get started," "learn all you can learn," develop and attitude for success," "take action" and "know your field."  But just by looking at the section titles, one can see that there aren't any revolutionary ideas being presented here.  I will say that, because this book outlines many obvious things, people who have read the book should not have any excuse for not being prepared to get a media job, aside from being completely lazy.  Suggestions range from actively planning for a career in the media to places to look for more information to make one's self an expert in a specific area.  The tidbits of advice direct you to places to go for more information.  There's no specific help in this book, when there easily could have been; there are only suggestions as what somebody should start looking into, with ideas about how to do that.  The writer seems like he wants to go more in-depth at times but backs off.   Emphasis is placed on developing good habits before one enters the workforce and once a job is secured.  While every point is valid, again, many seem to state the obvious.  Everyone knows that you'll be a better job candidate if you're more qualified that other applicants.  Many of the author's suggestions just restate that idea in slightly more specific ways.  The book also contains an adequate list of resources for finding jobs.  I've seen comparable lists for job banks before.  People who have already searched for jobs probably won't find anything new in this book.  Also listed are publications and organizations to look into that could provide an extra edge to somebody seeking a communications career.  The book also contains a guide to what media jobs are actually out there, something that could be helpful to those who know they want to work in communications but aren't exactly sure what all is available.  People who know what they want to do might also be able to pinpoint their specialty using this section.  Realistically, however, people who are serious about media careers will already know all this information.  I learned nothing from this section 
 Sony botched the 1996 re-master by not preserving the original segue-way that bridged "Lovin Touchin Squeezin" and "City of The Angels".  They have failed to correct this error with this newer, supposedly "re-masterd" version.    On the original vinyl release, "City Of The Angels" kicked in before the final chorus of "Lovin Touchin Squeezin" had completely faded to silence - presenting a similar effect that had been utilized for "Feelin' That Way/Anytime" on Infinity.  At the time, some AOR radio stations even played these two tracks together.  As completely seperate tracks on CD, the famous ending of "Lovin Touchin Squeezin" becomes clumsy as the final tones of reverb are cut off abruptly. Ultimately, it is only a couple seconds cut off (reverb echoing to silence) - But as one of Journey's signature tunes, you'd think that they'd have taken the time to get it right and preserver the original context of the release.  The original ending of 'Lovin Touchin Squeezin" (with final seconds of reverb) can be heard on the two disc collection, Essential Journey - but of course, as the set is a collection of radio songs, it does not segue into "City Of The Angels" as it originally did (and should) on Evolution.  A minor point I know.  BUT - Sony is clearly trying to honor and replicate the original release. They should take the time to check all the details to get it right.  Or - why bother 
 This film is disappointing.  The narration is distracting and tedious.  What there is of the individual stories is interesting, but not worth suffering through endless sex education for the hopelessly ignorant. 
 This was the most boring book I have had the mispleasure of reading. Our book club chose it based on a review one of our members read. Needless to say after every member complained about the book and found nothing positive to say we looked into other reviews and found them to match our opinion. Do not waste your money on this book 
 Even though the pan is pre-seasoned and using baking spray, cornbread frequently sticks, resulting in a non-cactus shaped lump of food. Then it is difficult to clean the small crevices. Not recommended 
 I was really excited about this book before I opened it.  I was very disappointed to see that it really only covers larger houses which already have space available.  All the pictures show rooms with high to very high ceilings, entrance ways, and alot of open space.  Unfortunately, I think, that the average house is much smaller, with less room to work with & lower ceilings, not every place has utility rooms, verandas or entrance ways to utilize.  Even the bathrooms were larger than most I've seen.  Also, many houses do not even have very much extra wall space due to small room dimensions, windows, doorways & possibly a fireplace.  Try to work around that - that's what I was expecting to see, I guess, more variety in the types of homes.  If you do get this book, be prepared to renovate 
 I remember my brother reviewing R. Kelly's latest album TP.3 Reloaded and giving it a one-and-a-half-star rating, and I asked him, "R. Kelly's album is really that bad?" He said yes, but I still listened to the album for myself and, well, he was right.  Not only is this album too long (75 minutes), but you can tell that there is only one thing on Kelly's mind: sex. This album gets so sexual that even the guys in Silk would say, "Okay, we get the point, man!" But the bad thing isn't merely the sexuality of the songs; it's how stupid the songs are. This is obvious when Kells shoots for sexual metaphors like "Sex Weed" and what is probably the worst song of his career, "Remote Control". Here, I guess since Ron Isley wasn't available, Rrah does his best Mr. Biggs impression himself, and he kicks the entire song in falsetto, making the song painful on the ears. In fact, that song is so bad that I had to stop in the middle of it.  Things aren't any better when Kells makes songs for the club, because they all sound like reheated "Fiesta" remixes. Not only that, but he's RAPPING again on "Girls Go Crazy" (featuring Baby). "Burn It Up" kind of sounds like Akon's "Bananza" (which is a bad song in itself), and "Hit It Til the Mornin'" is a bad song made worse by a guest spot by Do Or Die, of all people.  Other travesties include "In the Kitchen" and "Put My T-Shirt On". And I can't even say that the five-part epic "Trapped In the Closet" saves the album because I never even liked Chapter 1; plus the chapters get stupider as they go on. The only song out of this whole disc that I can even stand is "Touchin'". Although I have no idea how Nivea got on this album, she and R. have good chemistry on the song.  There's another song, the confessional "Kickin' It With Your Girlfriend", where the first verse begins with: "Go on and slap me again." And that's exactly what I want to do to Kells for even letting this album see the light of day. If you were unfortunate enough to buy this, just bury it somewhere and forget it ever happened.

 Too large - they obscure tabs beneath. They are so wide they make 4 rows instead of 2. 
 Cook's Illustrated is the first cooking magazine that I'd found myself truly motivated to read cover-to-cover, even though they DO insert advertisements for their own products, which I suppose, to them, makes this an "ad-free" magazine, but I'm not surprised they've bent the rules with that claim. The one time I found it necessary to contact Cook's Illustrated about a customer service issue, I was simply floored by the treatment that I received... I'll simply leave it at that.  I personally don't intend on re-subscribing ("Fine Cooking", here I come!). You, however, may find that this is the cooking magazine for you. And, as far as what they do goes, Cook's Illustrated IS good at what they do - I'll give them that.    If you have not found this review to be helpful, I'm sorry if I haven't made the value in my warning apparent. Just know that there are those of us out there who HAVE had bad experiences, and are simply trying to prevent others from experiencing the same. 
 First time I write a review, but I thought I would take the bother. I did not like this book. Although the title is accurate, it is about conversations with millionares, the conversations are not very enriching. I would have prefered to have spent my money on something else.     BE WARNED!!! In the book there is a web page address were two free gift are promised, this is not true a you are requested to sign up with your e-mail, only to be bombarded with SPAM, and end up with no gift 
 The opening 30 minutes of this movie is pretty interesting. It reveals the Nazi struggle to launch the V-1 rocket and the British effort to figure out what the Germans are up to. The story of Hanna Reitsch, a top FEMALE Nazi test pilot is a movie in of itself. Her scenes are very good. Also Paul Henreid of 'Casablanca' fame (Victor Lazlo)  plays a Nazi General. It is interesting to see him 23 years after Casablanca. But then, the great wooden actor George Peppard makes his appearance. You talk about a movie losing steam, it loses steam quicker than a tea kettle taken off a hot stove. The plot then becomes dreary and dreadful and predictable, and it becomes for me a '0' star film. The incredibly sexy Sophia Loren is in the movie, but they have her dressed in a dark blue TURTLENECK sweater!! You can't even see her beautiful body. What a waste. She was married to the Producer so I guess she worked cheap. At several points in this epic they use black & white WWII STOCK footage (its a color movie), its laughable, as is most of the acting. 
 I can understand the enthusiasm behind this little tract (it's not a book, though it costs a book's ransom).  I can understand Timothy Freke wanting to reach out and offer his insights into the true nature of reality.  But this just doesn't give us enough.  Wake up?  Yes, he's right.  Most of us are sound asleep.  But yelling wake up! is no more helpful than telling someone in crisis to "pull their socks up."  Meanwhile, there's so much out there that offers truly stunning glimpses into the nature of consciousness...and I don't mean the desperate brain scientists who keep trying to convince themselves and us that all things wild and wonderful are abberant chemicals gone awry in the brain, very much including after-death experiences.  I noticed one reviewer mentioned Seth.  If you can get past the fact that it's "channeled," a real voice that will turn your world inside out is Seth.  Jane Robert's Seth.  I was a Catholic, but I'm still a philosophy freak.  Read it all my life.  And no one and nothing touches Seth for a cohesive and utterly convincing glimpse into reality as it is/isn't...not Plato, not Socrates, not Plotinus, not the Epicurians, and certainly not the later Gnostics.  As for Lucid Living, well...nope.  Not enough for serious, or even not so serious, seekers 
 I've seen ethan hawk's best performance ever in this movie. it was great. Wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie. it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, this movie does not worth to buy. does not even worth to rent. but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally. It's worth to be watch once at TV! By the way, I forgot to mention that this movie has a great CD soundtrack, really great. worth to buy 
 I adored Walker's The Color Purple, so when I pulled her book The Temple of My Familiar off a friend's shelf, I looked forward to an entertaining and elucidating time.  Unfortunately, the book was disappointing.  Most readers - and certainly all writers - are familiar with the maxim, "Show, don't tell."  Walker breaks this fundamental rule and has characters telling for the entire book.  For the most part, the characters sound like each other.  For the most part, the listeners sit by, accepting, unquestioning, drinking in the words and stories as if they are the most profound wisdom, their mouths as wide open as if they were baby birds, never disagreeing with or challenging what is told them.  Perhaps this is how Walker intends these views to be taken, however, remaining in a state of awe for more than 400 pages is difficult for a reader.  Besides - although I find her viewpoint interesting, which emphasizes the importance of the Goddess and the idea that all would be much better if black women ruled the world - I can't agree with it. I think that the majority of whites - admittedly, not all - don't spend their time these days thinking about how to keep black people down.  Many of us cheer when blacks do well - a successful black person is much better for society than a black who is poor and unhappy - just as we cheer when other the people of other races do well.  Perhaps I would have appreciated the story more if I could have sighed and said, "how true" - but I could not.  However, the real problem in The Temple of My Familiar is not what Walker is saying, but how she is saying it.  Furthermore, the book itself is complicated and convoluted, with tangled relationships between the characters.  And I don't mean that the relationships are emotionally complex, just that there are lots of aunts and uncles and difficult-to-diagram genealogical charts, as well as some confusion as to who is sleeping with whom.  Furthermore, the characters never seem to touch each other, again, because Walker tells instead of shows.  We are told that they are happy or that they are sad or that they are moved - but we don't feel it, because we are told instead of shown.  There are glimmers of brilliance.  The opening is wonderful - possibly because Walker was showing instead of telling at this point, and because at this point the cast of characters is small and manageable.    
 There is essentially no sound amplification.  The sound levels are barely different with the thing on as opposed to having it off.  Sort of a "what were they thinking" product 
 This book gives the most childish facts. I guess to a young child who only began his/her interest in Titanic might find this book as a good start, otherwise it is pointless buying this book, since it gives nothing new and  gives inaccurate drawings. To a more interested person, I really would not  recomend this book 
 If I could have given this book no stars I would have.  It was a complete waste of money and time.  Ms. Bacall comes across as a sour, shrewish old woman.  I don't know why actors think their political opinions are the ones we should all have.  Her disdain for her fellow Americans and our President lost her this former fan.  I've read my last book by Bacall 
 I got this as a present for my fiance,thinking it would be a cute funny gift during our pregnancy.However,it got here and neither of us were amused.It's a HORRIBLE book 
 I'm sorry but I must agree with others here that this was a very slow, confusing BORING book! I've heard about Linda Barnes and was told she's a good writer - not in this book! I think maybe it could have possibly been better by cutting at least 100 pages! (Yes, I put all those extra words in on purpose!) I really do NOT have to know every stupid detail about how she gets from point A to point B! Really! I haven't read (nor will I ever read) any of her previous books so the whole thread with her Little Sister was confusing and ... no necessary. I only gave the book two stars for a great premise. Too bad it was wasted 
 Anyone who has ever taught in a college or university needs to get this book, read it five or six times, and put it under his/her pillow at night.  Higher Education in this country is dying of three metastazing cancers: (1) Heavy emphasis on "retention schemes" that amount to little more than making a university a day-care center for 18-19 year-olds.  (2) Distance Learning, which will kill Higher Education within twenty years if scholars across the country don't stand up for academic rigor instead of mouse clicks.  (3) The marketing of education as a product to be bought and sold, rather than a service offered.  University students are not customers.  They are clients.  But increasingly, universities have ceased to be places where wisdom is taught and learned, and have become businesses to whom nothing matters except the financial bottom line.  Who cares if students learn anything?  All we want to do is to keep them around as long as possible, cater to their immature whims, and drain their parents' checkbooks or kite their student loans.  This book offers a way out of this morass.  Each university or college must assemble its own cadre of "monks" who see that Higher Education's emperor has no clothes, and who are not afraid to say so.  Higher Education today is like a runaway bullet train going 200 mph.  The problem is this: there is no station at the end of the track.  There is only a swamp,filled with trendy ideas, inflated grades, dumbed-down classes, and the rotting corpses of those brave souls who tried to warn the engineers what really lay at the end of the line.  To paraphrase Carl Perkins, universities today are saying, "You can do anything, but stay off of my bottom line."  As for me, I intend to be one of Berman's "monks," and spend my last few years in this profession trying to summon it again to excellence rather than expedience.  If you're an academic, this might well be the best book you'll ever read.  I opened it yesterday afternoon about 4:00 and finished it this morning at 3:30 a.m.  I've spent most of today sharpening my lance, preparing to sally forth and slay some dragons. The vandals are already inside the gates: our only choices are to fight or to surrender 
 This book is indeed scholarly but to whom?  Much of the data is concerning useless facts.  It is not intended to inform of the Black Death as I thought it would.  There are no scientific facts written; only boring useless facts of land ownerships and church renovations and construction.  I have gained nothing from this book 
 We all know that there is a difference between gym science and lab science.  Some of us also feel like we have an edge, or a leg up by doing these "rudimentary" exercises.  In Pavel's book "The Naked Warrior" he follows this mantra.  He touts that somehow, the Russians are far more superior in every aspect of fitness.  Although he is knowledgeable in many areas, he shluffs off a lot of safety guidlines in all of his books.  I have read all but one of his books, and they leave a lot to be desired.  What really makes me believe this even more is that he tries to suck you into buying other products and books.  If you buy "Relax Into Stretch," you'll feel like you're not getting enough info because he's constantly plugging "Super Joints".  If you buy all of his books, you'll feel incomplete unless you subscribe to the website.  If you subscribe to the website, you'll feel incomplete unless you go to his certification course for his kettlebells.  He's a shrewd businessman, and deserves credit for that, however don't rely on his books for too much credible info.  Take what you can from them and bounce them off of other credible sources.  You'll find a lot of conflicting information.  
 I believe this book is a good technical study in the bits and bytes of how payment systems work, yet lacks the real-world applications, value propositions, and financial information on why some payment systems work, and many others are complete failures in the real world.  Technology is only one segment of the payment arena 
 Sorry SleepMD - we are not impressed.  Not only did SleepMD not work for me - but my husband took it as well and was restless and up all night too.  Today we feel worse for the wear - and a bit ripped off.  No - I did not sleep through the night and wake up feeling alert and refreshed. More like we were run over during the night. I wanted to inquire to the company in person - but can't find a website to do so.  So I plan to write. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  It's a waste of money 
 How people can read and be fooled by the nonsense sprouted in ths rag is beyond me. All the usual suspects are found through out it's pages. This rag represents all those things that leftists are now notorious for: Polictal correctness, anti-capitalists, anti-gobalisers etc With all these -isms and ologies your in for a pain in the head. What's more the 'ideas' you'll find here have been tried, tested and more importantly failed. Ah well... some people are just too easy to fool 
 Well the title kind of says it all. Dull,ugly,boring men in a dull,ugly boring movie. Also the most unreallistic sexual pairing in the world. Stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Hurley with ugly, skinny, beaked nosed  Denis Leary.Steve Buscemi is comical as usual and adds the only bright spot to the film. 
 Don't let the title fool you as it did me.  For whatever reason, I led myself to believe the whole movie took place on a train in the same fashion Rear Window takes place all within one location.  It doesn't, but part of me wished it had.  As far as the plot goes, two strangers meet on a train.  Guy, a pro tennis star, and Bruno, a psychotic socialite.  He proposes to Guy that they both help each other, with Bruno murdering Guy's cheating wife, and in return Guy killing Bruno's father.  Part of this felt very Throw Mama From the Train to me, but more funny.  Anyway, I have come to expect great things, and high tension from Hitchcock, and sorry to say, he didn't deliver this time around.  The best part of this movie is Robert Walker's portrayal of Bruno, who seems friendly and normal, but just by listening to him talk for more than a couple minutes, you get the feeling he is as far from normal as you can get.  His performance reminded me eerily of Kevin Spacey.  If they were to remake this movie (and as much as I despise remakes, I believe they are planning one), they'd be foolish not to offer it to him.  So for what it's worth, Hitchcock is still the master, but don't let this be your introduction to him if you're new to his body of work, there are many superior choices 
 The tracks are great.  Much better than the original versions.  But I can't (easily) rip this CD so that I can listen to it in my house.  Thus the product itself is useless.  I'd give this product a negative if I could 
 Full of holes and alot of overbearing personal philosophy.  I found myself crossing out lines of this text, as so much of this is conjecture and hyperbole.  The chapter on Violence is worth the cost of the book, however, I would recommend going to the library and saving your money.  Some directors swear by this text, thusly it is a potent force in the contemporary theatre.  However, many of these ideas have been chewed up and misused by so many inexperienced Bogart groupies that it has little more validity than, say, a Richard Foreman text in its extremely self-referential nature.  
    I have read this book several times. Each time, I grew more and more puzzled. I thought...I thought this was supposed to be about writing!  It isn't. If you're looking for Brenda's personal philosophy, this is The Book. If you want advice on how to write, this is a terrible book. The only good side could be that she encourages writers who don't see themselves as good writers, or writers at all.   Other than that, the book is so many murdered trees. Brenda spouts the whole garbage about truth being truth if you think it is true. Her school is the type that shrinks from approaching the technical aspects of writing. Or telling some people that their piece of writing is junk.    Basically, she tells you what you want to hear. All is good and nice, a few mildly interesting stories, and no relevant advice on writing. I kept getting this nauseated feeling while reading it.   Snore.. 
 Unfortunately, just like most books of its kind (histories of specific firms written with full cooperation from the firm involved), "The Perfect Store" is way too obsequious to eBay's official "party line", and doesn't engage in real, hard-hitting, investigative journalism.  Moreover, the book is severely out of date -- it tells you nothing about the last several years of eBay, and in a sector that changes as fast as internet commerce, this is a serious problem.  The book is well-written and competently organized, but that doesn't make up for the substantial problems with the quality and timeliness of its conents 
 This book is not what I expected. Many of the cakes are ice cream cakes, which I wasn't interested in and I wasn't forewarned about. I was looking for a book that would give me easy to follow instructions, on easy to make cakes, in cute themes.  There are maybe 3 cakes I would consider using and they won't be easy.  So overall this book was a big waste of money.  I think I'll be better off using my own creativity. 
 A former British Intelligence officer, Lewis was one of those postwar travel writers whose books sold like gangbusters but have since largely faded into obscurity. Having recently traveled to Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia, and being a fan of the travelogue genre, I thought this might be a fitting introduction to his work. Originally published in 1951, the book documents his trip of the previous year to French Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) -- an era when the French colonial rule was in decline and the Viet Minh had already taken up arms to drive them out. The majority of the book is spent in Vietnam, although certain spots on the modern tourist routes are given their due, such as Siem Reap (Angkor) and Luang Prabang.  Lewis writes clean, crisp, one might say "British" prose, which is easily digested -- so much so, in fact, that it takes a while to realize that the book is actually quite boring. His trip is somewhat of a litany of banal travel clichés: descriptions of bad roads, worse bus drivers, decrepit vehicles, inscrutable natives, "exotic" food, and so forth. Despite his evident interest in various small rural tribes, he doesn't seem to know very much about them, and thus, isn't able to tell the reader much of anything useful about them either. The most interesting parts of the book are his interactions with other Westerners, especially the missionaries, plantation lords, and various French civil and military administrators who are eager to show him around.  The missionaries and plantation bosses come in for pretty heavy scorn from Lewis, and anyone interested in the roots of the Vietnam War would be well advised to read the chapter where Lewis witnesses firsthand how the French system in Vietnam operated along feudal relationships of power and local villagers were forced to labor on plantations. Alas, there's also plenty of scorn (albeit less direct) for the natives of the places he visits. There are no end of terms such as "squalid", "barbaric", "indolent", "immoral", "sinful" and the like applied to various tribespeople along the way. The levels of condescension are rather disappointing from someone eulogized by the Telegraph after his death as "perhaps the best, and certainly the most underrated, English travel writer of the 20th century."This is the book that allegedly inspired Graham Greene to go to Vietnam and then produce The Quiet American, but most contemporary readers will find Greene's book to be far more engaging than this dated work. 
 I can not believe that Nora Robert cheapens herself by writing such drivel. This is the first and last J.D. Robb book I will chance reading. I only read it half way through. It was so unclear, seemingly written with the pretense of intelligence. I thought the constant empty dialogues were wasted breath. I have read seven books by Nora Roberts and I will have to wonder if she has a twin sister living insider her mind who must be writing the J.D. Robb stories. She seems to me to be wandering from realism in her Roberts books to total abstract in her Robb books. I think in her Robb stories she must be letting her hair down with all of the unnecessary swearing and attitude the female characters have. There is a lot of rage there. I will take Nora Roberts over Robb any day. Sorry Robb fans, I just think it is all to shallow to waste my time going there again. Just like paintings from abstract to real, different strokes for different folks 
 I ordered the large turtle dock and did not receive the suction cups or the support bracket.  I have emailed the company twice with no response.  I have tried to call and I get no where.  So for three weeks now, my turles have a raft and float away from the lamp.  
 This is my third Vince Flynn book, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  "Executive Power" incorporates two stories, neither of which have anything to do with each other.  It's as if Flynn had enough for two half stories and then squished them together.  The first is a story about an American family kidnapped in the Philippines. Lurking in the background is another story set in the Middle East.  I thought Flynn was going to bring the two stories together.  But he never did.  He resolved one in sweeping fashion and then focused on the other.  If you only read one Vince Flynn book, I recommend that you read "Transfer of Power."  THAT is an exciting book.  But stay away from "Executive Power."  You'll be thoroughly disappointed 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 Boney used to be the man, but now he has 2 crappy releases behind him. Anyone who thinks this CD is good should listen to his older stuff like Seduction, Trust, or Backbone. You will quickly realize that he has not been living up to his full potential. Cmon'Boney lets get back to multi-dimentional stuff that you used to be the master of. Peace 
 I bought this book to learn about nutrition.  Not be inundated by your beliefs (not FACTS).  I will not recommend this book.  
 I thought I was going to get a thriller when I first heard of this.  Instead I got a pseudo-sequel to COLD MOUNTAIN set in 1980 Texas, and I have rather low opinions of COLD MOUNTAIN.  It was difficult to follow the story due to McCarthy's decision to not only avoid using quotation marks to identify dialogue (a move I've always considered to be a pretentious affectation), but also commas, apostrophes, and proper spelling, such as not capitalizing "English" or using "livingroom" instead of "living room" and "mam" instead of "ma'am."  I don't know if this is something McCarthy does in all his books or this was a one-time deal, but it was a major turnoff and made the experience grueling rather than enjoyable.  I also didn't see the relevance of the italicized monologues of Sheriff Bell at the beginning of each chapter/section, as he tended to ramble on about life after  World War Two and how it wasn't uncommon to see 22-year-olds as ordained ministers or 25-year-olds as sheriffs of counties the size of Delaware.  Hopefully its movie adaptation (which I legitimately pity the Coen Brothers for having to wade through) is more accessible 
 The book is made to sound as if it would be all you need to become a Medical Billing/Health Insurance specialist.  Not a chance.  You will need the most current coding manuals to even attempt to complete this course.  And even then without the answers you have no way to check your progress.  There must be better books, Keep Searching 
 The Microsoft Wireless Optical Elite has been a less than satisfactory purchase for me.  Although I like the feel of the keyboard, I am still having trouble getting used to the layout, and have found that it is easy to hit the thumbwheel on the left side, causing the screen to scroll unexpectedly.  I've found the placement and layout of the group of buttons to the right of the main keys, and containing the Delete, PageUp and PageDown buttons, to be particularly troublesome: I always seem to be hitting the wrong key, and have sometmes brushed the Delete key while typing, with the usual unhappy results.  The driver is constantly telling me that I have low signal strength, even though the wireless receiver is within 2 inches of the keyboard.  Replacing the batteries has not helped.  I've also found that it tends to skip characters while typing.  The mouse is a bit better: it feels comfortable and works as expected, with no surprises.  All in all, although better than the keyboard on my laptop, this is not a product I can recommend, particularly given the price.  Some of the lower priced wireless Microsoft keyboards used by friends and family seem to work better, and are laid-out better, than this "top of the line" model. 
 Of the many books and periodical articles that I have read concerning the Spanish Inquisition, this is the most biased and speculative and opinionated.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It is extremely long and tedious. We realize that the Inquisition was shameful. However, this work substitutes one prejudice for another 
 When I read Michael Cunningham's A Home at the End of the World, I was so dazzled by his prose that I found myself stopping again and again to reread and admire his sentences. In The Hours, he combined the same stylistic virtuosity (paragraph after paragraph imitating Virginia Woolf's style, for example) with a novelistic structure that took three separate narratives set in different times and slowly wound them together to devastating effect. Specimen Days also presents three linked narratives, but everything that we admired about Cunningham's earlier books is missing here. The prose is utterly pedestrian, the plotting ranges from the unlikely to the preposterous, and the links between the three narratives are disappointingly mechanical and superficial.  The three narratives of Specimen Days are set in New York in different eras--the late nineteenth century, the present, and some time a century or so from now. To be fair, there's a thematic connection between them: in each case, one character sacrifices everything for the good of another character whom he or she knows only superficially. But the sad difference between Specimen Days and The Hours is this: in The Hours the three narratives merge to create something larger than each one is by itself, but in Specimen Days the three stories, presented sequentially, fail to illuminate--or even to relate to--one another. Instead, they're connected merely by a quirk (in each, there's a character who recites lines from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass), a prop (a white porcelain bowl), and the characters' similar names. One thinks longingly of the subtly with which Cunningham evolved the stories in The Hours and wonders what went wrong here.  Each of the stories in Specimen Days is more improbable than the last. The most successful is the first, about a boy who gives up everything to save another character from a disaster he only imagines and ends up saving her from an actual unimagined real disaster. (Since this story is the one most worth reading, I won't give away more of the plot.)  In the second story, a police hotline operator/psychologist unaccountably walks away from her career and her boyfriend to go on the lam with a child bomber whom the police are seeking and who, she thinks, will eventually kill her anyway. Sure. The third story is set in a United States that has been visited by a new species (think large versions of the Geico gecko, but without the engaging British accent) and that has been largely laid waste by some kind of unspecified nuclear or ecological disaster. The story has to do with a lizard character who helps a near-human android get from New York to Denver so that the android can contact his creator. The android suffers from an inability to experience human emotions, but through a turn of events when they reach Denver, he discovers that he can experience beauty and compassion like a full human being after all. "It seems I did a better job with you than I'd realized," says the android maker approvingly. That's right: think Star Trek's Mr. Data meets the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz. How amazing, how disappointing, that such derivative dreck is coming from the pen of Michael Cunningham.   
 I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.  Just on a side note, "The Bad Place" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining. 
 My best friend advised me not to read this book. But, she's a bit of an elitist, so I figured, what the heck? I mean, I like plenty of things she finds annoying or stupid. I was wrong. Here is my honest impression of the book:  First chapter: This isn't so bad.. a bit melodramatic.. but not bad Quarter of the way through the book: He is not going there, is he? Third of the way through: OH GOD!!!! He went there!!! Halfway: Please, please stop this... oh no, he's borrowing from everything I hold dear! Three quarters: *Mouth open in disbelief* This is TERRIBLE!!! End of book: Why, why didn't I listen?   I recently saw the trailer and thought "Wow, that really reminds me of A New Hope.You know, the scene where Luke is looking off into the sunset.." It isn't the unoriginality that made me hate the book, or the bloody mess Young Sky - I mean, Paolini made of the archetypes in the book, it was the tone the author used. That smug, smug tone.   This fills me with sadness for all the good writers out there who don't have the rich, influential parents to push their work to the top of the stack 
 Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less 
 Not up to her usual standard.  Somewhat unbelieveable even by Mafia standards. Rather sensationalistic 
 James Jones's biography of Alfred c Kinsey is a valuable antidote to the hagiographies and demonologies published so far. Jones presents the nastier sides of his subject's personality and exposes his strategically concealed  sexual practices. However, Jones presents Kinsey as a pervert and  charlatan, failing to understand the moral and scientific rationales for  Kinsey's approach to sex research and thus totally misrepresents both the  man and his achievement. Jones's last-page sop to Kinsey's greatness seems  to be a cowardly after-thought to a bilious, splenetic and angry book 
 I heard this author was a teenage prodigy in China, who was exposed to media from early on and renowned. If the reputation was based on her writings, and if the whole point of this publication was to introduce the Chinese teenage sensation to the US context, she might as well write in Chinese and gets it translated rather than publishing whatever she barelo got to write. I really wansted my time on this barely readable work, which was mostly attributed to her telegram like sentences that had no style. Some authors write brilliantly regardless they are using English as their second language or as first one. So it might be unfair to say that. I think that it is not only her linguistic limitation caused the fatal damage on the text;she does not simply seem to have good enough insights or views to attract and guide readers through, or to be precise, she has nothing to say expecpt her huge ego to cry out that 'I represent China!', where she has nothing but complaint about. It was hell of an experience to go over this immature and embarrasing read cover to cover. Given this text came out, the standard demand to be met in the world literature China section was to feed readers with exotism and some superficial infos on how evil Chinese government was. The market was extremely little competitive given how big the pupulation is in China. So she follow the easy formula just to publish one book without nothing she really did seem to convey through it. But how boring and immature this book read to me. Wang's half way through political observation might go well with people who do not know much about what was going on in China, who were dominant population in US market. But someone who is familiar with the literary cliche prevalent as it is eaiser to employ the affirmative action in the marketing theory, it is really questionable to keep on acceptiong this type of publication.  
 I picked up this book expecting a mystery, and I was sorely disappointed.  While I enjoyed the characters and the setting, and even the body of the plot, the ending was terrible!  It felt like the author got tired of writing the book and just... stopped.  It makes me wonder if the author knew the answer to any of the mysteries at all 
 I (...)like the previous person, was assigned this book for required reading. The SAT vocabulary used in the story is simple, 5th graders should be able to comprehend what these words mean. The plot is dull and insipid, and the author strains to use the SAT vocabulary, making the dialogue seem too unreal (no one that age uses those words in their daily vocabulary) and eventually taking away from the story, making it a hard and unhelpful read 
 I bought this book hoping to learn about basic principles of genetics in an easy-to-understand format.  What I found was that the material was written many years ago.  All you need to do is to check the copyright year.  I knew that the one glaring error was the belief that there are 200,000 genes.  We now know there are about 30,000.  But it left me wondering what other information was outdated.  Not wanting to learn incorrect information, I sent it back.  If the authors update the content, then buy it because it's an enjoyable book.  
 It usually takes me about a week or two to get through a paperback. I've been  struggling to read this every night in bed for two months. It's boring and uninteresting. I quit 
 Strange Candy is a collection of 14 short stories by Laurell K. Hamilton, author of the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter and Merry Gentry novels.  The first story in the book, "Those Who Seek Forgiveness" is, as Laurell puts it, "the first time Anita ever walked on paper for me." I hate to say it, but it's not that great a story. This is obviously Anita Blake Mark I. The character traits that would make Anita something special, the wit, the vicious sense of humor, the repressed sexuality, are nowhere in evidence - because they didn't yet exist in the author's mind.  Many readers will be shocked to discover "Those Who Seek Forgiveness" was the template for much of Laurell's short novel Micah. I said good things about Micah upon its release. I would have been less impressed had I known how much of it was a retread. The basic plot of Anita being hired by a murderer to raise the zombie of their victim, the zombie breaking free of Anita's control to attack their killer, Anita flung through the air to crack her head on a gravestone, being knocked unconscious, waking up at the end of the story in a hospital bed after her client's death, all were lifted from "Those Who Seek Forgiveness".  The rest of the stories are mostly forgettable, about half-and-half not-very-fantastic fantasy and not-very-horrible horror. There's a reason Laurell K. Hamilton is not known as a great short story writer: she isn't. Overall her characters are cardboard, she hasn't the gift of sketching a believable, sympathetic personality in the few strokes allowed within a short story's limited word count. There's rarely a sense of real peril involved in the problems her characters face. The stories come across as unsatisfying, by-the-numbers exercises in which "people" you don't care about go through the motions of adventures that don't involve.  One irritating thing about the stories in Strange Candy, there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the order in which they're presented. For instance, there are two stories starring Sidra Ironfist set in Laurell's Nightseer universe. But why the hell is Sidra's first-ever appearance presented **after** the follow-on story?  We're almost through the book before we hit a real winner, "Here Be Dragons". And Here Be One Hell of a Story. It's shocking, after wading through so much dreck, to suddenly hit one of the neatest, most vicious little psychological horror pieces I've ever experienced. It's like reading the work of a completely different writer. If every story in Strange Candy was of the quality of "Here Be Dragons" this would be a 5 star collection.  "Winterkill" which is also set in the Nightseer world, is, surprisingly, pretty darn good. Other than "Here Be Dragons" it's the only decent story in the collection, in my opinion. I found myself liking and rooting for main character Jessa - which, considering she's basically a killer-for-hire is a great accomplishment on the writer's part.  Strange Candy is bookended by two Anita Blake tales. It begins ith "Those Who Seek Forgiveness" and ends with "The Girl Who Was Infatuated With Death" which takes place within continuity just before the novel Narcissus in Chains. As with so many recent Laurell K. Hamilton tales, "TGWWIWD" has a great set-up. Anita is hired to find a girl who is (a) dying of bone cancer and will in fact have her leg cut off in a few days, (b) about to be "turned" by a vampire, that very night, mostly so she can avoid the mutilation and painful death by cancer awaiting her otherwise. Problem: she's underage to legally make that choice. If the vampire turns her, he'll be up for execution. Does Anita "save" the girl from being turned - which legally is what she should do - knowing that by doing so she's condemning her to mutilation and, in short order, real death, or should she let it happen, knowing she's condemning the vampire? This presents Anita with a no-good-choices serious moral dilemma.  Unfortunately the great set-up soon gives way to zero forward momentum as the focus turns to - you guessed it - Anita's sex life. An over-emphasis on this one facet of Anita's life to the exclusion of plot has ruined every recent Anita Blake story, and it's no exception here. Thus, instead of bending all her efforts to finding the girl and the vampire in the few hours she has left, instead Anita spends the time playing footsy with Jean-Claude in his office at Guilty Pleasures while the police and other vampires do the job for her. Even Jean-Claude comments, "There was a time, ma petite, that you would have insisted on riding to the rescue yourself, questioning the girl's friend, and refusing to bring in the police at all." At which point I could not help but think, "Yeah, and wouldn't that be fun to read? There was a time this story would actually have been good."  Recommended for Anita Blake completists who absolutely need to own every word ever written about the character. Recommended for "Here Be Dragons" and "Winterkill". For myself this is a library rental, nothing more - a collection of mediocre short stories that just happens to contain one absolutely killer piece and one pretty good 
 Tom Clancy is at his best when describing military weapons systems and tactics. He does less well with his human characters who seem real enough during their missions, but become two dimensional when the action stops. The magic of a good book is that the characters come to life. Unfortunately, in Rainbow Six they never really do, and so I never really cared what happened to them. More disturbing is the amoral tone of the book. Tom Clancy takes the position that counter-terrorism teams have to crossover to the dark side in the service of the good.  This seemed supportable until the final mission where I felt the "good guys" lost their humanity.  If you give up the moral high ground and sink to the level of terrorists are you really any better then they are 
 Well I got these headphones and connected them and realized when it played the front center channel i only got sound from the front left speaker. Then the rear right channel didn't work at all. After calling tigerdirect to see about a refund. The first customer service rep was Rude and unwilling to help. Said we had to ship it back to them in the orginal big brown UPS box with all the extra millions of packing peanuts. After getting the management on the phone they were more willing to help but its not enough.  The headphones feel cheap and the wires are not color coded like everyone else uses. the instructions are lacking and the speakers that did work in them didn't sound that good at all 
 The whole premise and ultimate execution of this tacky and ridiculous fictional story line was an exercise in frustration and dissapointment for this viewer.  In short, the disjointed story line goes like this: troubled angst-ridden teen sees a person in a scary looking imaginary bunny suit (whose face resembled Iron Maiden's Eddie!) who gives him advice/messages; he escapes death (a jet engine crashing through his roof) because he listened to this fugly bunny and left his house; he gets instructions to conduct vandalism against those places and people he dislikes from said stuffed bunny; he discovers some old hag named Roberta Sparrow he knew was an ex. teacher at his high school who wrote a terrible version of a 'Hitchikers guide to time travel and worm holes'; same falling jet engine he escaped the first time around finally falls from the sky and kills him, but his girlfriend who died gets 'resurrected'.  Are you still with me??!!!  I love sci-fi and fiction, but all this is beyond ridiculous!  That, my friends, is essentially what this super cheesy 'made for mallrat teens' film is about!  I mean, 'Gigli' was a better film for chrissakes!  Even the made-up time travel rules and tenets from the various chapters of this stupid time travel book that they flashed onscreen from time to time was laughable.  In the end, the ONLY redeeming moments in the movie was when they used some great songs in the soundtrack from great alternative timeless rock bands like The Church, Duran Duran, Joy Division, and Tears For Fears.  Hardly enough to save the film though.  If you must, rent 'DD' if your curiosity is piqued, but to pay full retail for this movie is a certain waste of your (or your parents') money 
 I am such a huge fan of the Philosophy Grace line that I thought I would really love this, too.  I find that it is much too light for me.  It does smell exactly like cotton candy which is nice, but it doesn't last long at all.  I guess I'll have to really spray a lot for anyone to even notice I'm wearing it.  Nobody has said anything so far.  The shower gel is a waste as far as scent goes...wonderful lather, but no smell to speak of.  I will stick with Amazing Grace, Baby Grace and Pure Grace.  Those are wonderful 
 Ted and Elinor have been married and experiencing fertility problems.  Like most couples that are trying to have a child of their own, there are alot of emotions that both partners cannot understand.  Elinor is feeling completely useless and wonders why this is happening to her- and becomes ( understandably) wrapped up in her feelings, and well as her disappointment with her body that she is unable to conceive a child with her husband.  After failed attempts for IVF and other complicated fertility tries- she becomes very emotional and sad.   Ted- just withdraws from his wife and meets a woman- Gina and starts an affair.  Gina has a son that "falls in love" with Ted and he mentors him. Elinor finds out about both Gina and her son and Ted's extreme interest and sort of "completely distances" herself from Ted and everyone.  Now my problem with this story is this- yes, going thru something in a marriage such as infertility is terrible- The woman who goes thru 98% of all the tests, drugs- hormones- feelings on an extended level needs to be comforted more than her husband.  We know he loves her- but................. to have the author then have Ted have and affair and she has a child- I thought just would "stab" Elinor in the heart- then to make matters sadder...........Elinor becomes pregnant and again looses the baby.......  Well at that point- I just lost all hope for a possible happy ending and I finished the book- but wow- I think I needed some chocolate to something that would brighten up my day and my mood.  Talk about SAD  :  
 There is some good information to glean from this book, however, especially in the latter chapters, there is much that is contrary to my Christian world view.  The author may be more in tune to the spiritual realm than the medical/scientific community, as a whole, but his solutions go against the One who wrote the instruction manual and has the Ultimate Solution.  I found a couple of the latter chapters interesting and informative of another's beliefs, and the author brings awareness that there is more to human beings than just the physical/scientific realm, but we differ in how it is to be addressed.    
 The first day I took them out to hunt with them they fogged over.  I brought them home and there is fog INSIDE.  Also inside is some dark crap that you cannot get to...and it is on the lens.  I called Bushnell's help line and they told me..."Well, it isn't internally fog proof, just externally"  When asked about the stuff on the inside.  "That is probably fungus, that sometimes happens"  I JUST BOUGHT THE BINOCULARS!!!  He stated I could send them in and miss my entire hunting season and they would take the fungus out.  AVOID THESE AT ALL COSTS!!!  They are a shoddy product with an even worse strap that is plastic and cuts into your neck 
 I thought this would be a good product for my computer.  I didn't know that the only way to receive this product is over the internet via download.  During the process the prompts for the internet download ask you to remove (uninstall/delete) all of your known antivirus, spyware, and firewalls from your computer prior to install.  This leaves your computer susceptible when you receive an error message.  I received an error message that prevented me from completing the download.   I purchased the software on Aug 3 and called customer support, they researched the problem and even took remote access of my computer to try and fix the issue.  They were unable to do so and then passed me to the second level of computer technicans.  Microsoft guards its secrets well and has varying levels of technical support, those that know the basics and those that know more. they asked me to set up a time span when I would like to receive a call from the "teir II" agents, I chose 6-9pm.  I received several calls over the next two weeks, all of them were outside of the specified time.  I missed several of them because I have a career and a life.   When I finally spoke with an agent they again took over remote access of my computer and were also unable to solve the issue.  Here it was, two weeks after I purchased the software, I still did not have what I needed.  I was also unable to surf the web because the download process requires you to delete all antivirus and firewall software.  I called in several times druing the ordeal and the "teir I" agents just told me that I have to wait for the call, "they'll get to it when they get to it."  I was very upset with the customer support, I have no idea how the product is, but the customer support is just horrible.  Go to the windows live onecare home page and search for the "post your own thoughts" page through member accounts, you'll see that I'm not alone in this issue.  I have since purchased other software that cover what Microsoft says it will with onecare.  I did not have one problem with these installs.    Please be aware that you might have to purchase technical support if you cannot download due to a problem with your operating system (seperate from onecare).  This costs an additional $35 ontop of the cost for onecare 
 Mars and Venus Together Forever is one of the most ridiculous, stupid books that I have ever had the gross misfortune to read.  I probably should have expected what I got, considering that Mars and Venus on a Date left me cold, but I read this one anyway because the original Mars and Venus book had SOME interesting insights and I'm a sucker for a cheap book.  Anyone who buys into the stereotypes promoted by John Gray must be barmy.  He exaggerates, overemphasises and blusters his way through the 200+ pages - probably with the best motives in his mind - but in the end the stuff he writes is uninspiring and insipid.  According to him men and women are still ruled by `ancient' traditions which dictate that women are all do-gooder types who only desire to stay at home, chatting with other women and looking at flowers whilst men are all aggressive cavemen, grunting their way through their lives with zero finesse, a beer in one hand and the TV remote in the other.  I don't see how anyone, man or woman, could read this book without being annoyed.  For women, the book is terribly unempowering.  If you don't fit in with any of Gray's ideas about what a woman should be then you are labelled as masculine.  I don't want to read a book which tells me that when I am at work I am moving towards my masculine side because being goal-oriented, competitive and efficient are male traits.  It's all phooey!  For men, the book is also offensive.  John Gray says that men shouldn't express their feelings because it will cause a woman to lose her attraction for him.  No, I don't believe that men and women are the same in all respects - there are gender differences - but in Mars and Venus these are distorted.  Overall this book is not worth your time.  Underneath the waffle there may be some good points, but all of these are outweighed by the stereotypes.  JoAnn 
 I have never enjoyed reading the novels of one historical romance author so much. But this was a dissapointment Ms. Small! Altough she always has bored me a trifle with her details, the plots are usually well thought out and intriguing. But in this novel, after finding the love of her life, Patrick has dementia and they cancel their wedding plans. After two years she lets Logan who pursues her constantly throughout the novel take her body and her hand in matrimony after she refuses him so long! When it says: "Rosamund sat up. What was she doing? She jumped from her bed, lokking to gather up her other garments. "You shall not have me you monster!" I thought she was coming to her senses and would finally wait on her true love to regain his memory , but alas twas not to be. She should not have married again. It was tantamount to a betrayal! I am so mad atMs. Small for ending this book this way! I give the book two stars for the romance of a lifetime she allowed us to see between Rosamund and Patrick 
 I'm normally a fan of Warren Ellis' writing, but did not enjoy this series. It went on far too long and could have ended in half the time. Intereaction between the Ultimates and the X-Men was odd. Apparently, they now want to kill each other.  I know it's part of a trilogy, but the other parts aren't very good either.  Hey, at least Falcon makes his first appearance 
 First of all, I need to be honest, and say that I did not finish this book.  I read the first two parts about Lily and the other one was about Sandra, and that was it.  I could not take it any more.  The chapters were way longer than they had to be to get what the author was trying to get over to her audience.  It seem to go over and over the same things way to many times before it actually got to the point.  I do not recommend reading this book at all 
 Nash, Gary, History on Trial, Culture War and The Teachings of the Past.  Nash, obsessed with race, class, and gender concerns and grieving over the severe beating taken by the National History Standards writes this book telling why the critics, he stigmatizes as "right wing extremists", were wrong. We are not told how this is squared with the acknowledged fact that the Standards were sufficiently deficient to require revision. The book is slow reading and the constant application of the thumb screw, the rack , and the carving knife to the facts is distracting as well as embarrassing. Omissions are revealing, e.g., Nash neglects to tell us that the Council for Basic Education (CBE), which was formed to review the original version of the Standards, was not exactly an impartial "referee." Nash, the primary director of the Standards project, was given veto power over the composition of the two CBE review panels, and he used it to keep serious critics, such as John Patrick Diggins of CUNY, off the panel.  In this book Nash continually displays his animosity to the Great Satans of America, i.e. patriotic organizations such as the DAR, SAR, VFW, and the American Legion.  It is an anti-intellectual book written by a leading postmodern who follows an "off with their heads" approach to anyone not who does not pay homage to his rigid orthodoxy of politically correct views on race, class, and gender matters.

 I have been in the antiques business for 35 years.  I have NEVER found an unusual mark in this book.  It resides at the back of my closet, I never use it and probably never will.  Problem is, I can't find any book on pottery marks that does do the job.  The Kovels annual price guides are also a fat waste of money, don't bother.  
 I bought this E&A after Glannon's E&A saved me in Civil Procedure.  Unfortunately, this topic just is not well suited to the E&A format.  For anyone looking for a little help in Con Law, I highly recommend Erwin Chemerinsky's horn book--Constitutional Law (not a terribly inventive title, but it is a great supplement) 
 If Mr. Alterman just watched a nightly news cast of CNN, which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality, then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web, tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality. Uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like McDonalds fast food, however those who know better, avoid it because it can be damaging to one's mental health, but then again Mr. Alterman just wrote this book for the money, even if he makes a fool of himself doing it 
 I found this book embarrassing to read - not because it's risque, but because it so clearly illustrates how the French & Italians got their reputations as great lovers. Is this the best that English literature can give us? This fellow clearly understands little of female anatomy, let alone female sexuality.   It's also mean-spirited. Lawrence proves his points by setting up his version of idealized man and even more idealized woman, and then spends most of the book trying to knock down every other character and concept. This is his only real method of proving the superiority of his ideal. He drips way too much contempt.  Everything outside of sex is dumb, meaningless, ridiculous. Attempting to derive enjoyment from the "mental life" makes one ridiculous; being paralyzed makes one ridiculous; trying to have sex in any way outside Lawrence's own true and correct way makes one pathetic, or defective, or spiteful; not being able to enjoy the sort of lovemaking Lawrence proposes makes one undeserving of the title of "woman" or "man"; and so on.   Looking at Italian art is stupid. Everything in Paris is stupid. Constance can apparently tell from a glance that nobody in France knows how to have sex properly.  Reading the book without his openly contemptuous commentary on what's "wrong" with everyone except C. and M., one might easily conclude that Constance doesn't really seem happier now that she's sleeping with the gamekeeper, and Hilda does seem happier in Venice - the author counters this by ridiculing "that kind" of happiness as delusional and druglike. He even seems to imply that her being so pleased with her life is yet more proof that there's something wrong with her. Of course Constance is wretched, because she does not have that one thing that, in Lawrence's view, really matters in life - not Mellors, but Mellors' equipment. This book does degenerate into phallus-worship, which makes the author's hostility toward "druglike" pleasures seem sort of ironically comical.  Hilda is pathetic precisely because she can derive enjoyment from sensual pleasures: from Venice, from the feel of the sun, from jazz, from dancing. This seems weird to me - as if Lawrence is punishing the uppity woman. Hilda is also described as worse than pathetic - she is a "user", with strong suggestions that she is cold and immoral - because she enjoys that part of dancing which allows her to press up against a strange man, only to walk away when the dance is over. (This may be why at least one reviewer called the book sexist, since obviously Lawrence doesn't mind if Mellors is callous and behaves as a "user".)   It's actually sort of creepy how an author who seems to be claiming that sensuality is good consistently knocks sensual pleasures like the feel of sunshine on one's body. Everything is stupid except sex - and not just any sex, but his notion of real sex.   This is where astute readers will have the most trouble. Lawrence clearly defines a "real" woman - Constance Chatterly - by contrasting her with bad examples.   A woman who lays there "unfeeling" is clearly an example. Such a woman is described in terms suggesting she lacks warmth/decency/heart/womanhood/etc. Lawrence doesn't even seem to have considered the possibility that maybe what the man is or isn't doing could even be related; it's presented quite clearly as a difference between good/desireable women vs. women who are defective not only physically, but in character.  On the other hand, a woman with an unfeminine urge to be In Control - that is, one who insists on moving herself, rather than sitting passive and letting the man do what he will - is forgivable when Michaelis is the male (because he's premature, and meant to be pathetic), but it turns unforgiveable when it's women in general and especially Mellor's Bertha, who just refused to come when she should out of spite. Bertha just had a sick (!) urge to be In Control, demonstrating her essentially vicious and pathological nature. The only thing Mellors did wrong was to not put her in her place promptly - he "spoilt" her.   As for all those touchy-feely things that women so frequently enjoy? Forget it. Lawrence suggests that Mellors does at least sometimes kiss and touch, but if it happens at all it appears to be mostly incidental, nothing important. A Real Woman doesn't need foreplay. Just hop on and go, and if she's what she ought to be, she'll feel crashing waves and dark tides sooner or later.  These were what I found the most embarrassingly inaccurate - that a woman's duty is to lie there, not too passive, but not too active, and come when she's supposed to (and if she doesn't, it's her own fault); while a man's job is to climb on top and "perform". All of this is based on what ought to be a perfectly logical set of assumptions that are, unfortunately, not true. The truth is that a woman's vagina is not the equal-but-opposite inverse of a male penis; there's a thing that both males and females start out with, which in a man becomes the penis, and in the woman becomes (or remains) a clitoris. Lawrence seems to assume that what a woman feels is similar to what a man feels - but he assigns this feeling to the wrong body part.   Women have always known about their own bodies; surely a man so dedicated to the advancement of sexuality could have and should have taken more time to research how women really feel about things, preferably apart from what women think men "want to hear". This, too, is no doubt why it has been accused of being "sexist". The author (or at least Mellors) openly blames women who cannot or will not "come to the crisis" when she ought, as if it were entirely of the woman's doing and had nothing at all to do with the man.   It's also likely that science will eventually prove (if it hasn't already) that women like Constance Chatterly are not the norm or 'what a woman ought to be' emotionally as well as physically. For all that Lawrence spends an awful lot of energy ripping apart what he sees as silly, even noxious emotions and desires - such as "intimacy" and "connection", both of which he has Constance openly ridicule - biologists are increasingly finding that not only do men and women tend to have different feelings and expectations when it comes to the sex act, but that there is believed to be an evolutionary advantage in these differences, based on the notion that a man's biological job is to get his DNA out there, while reproduction for a woman involves a heavy emotional and physical commitment. If this is true, it would be the woman who takes such a cavalier and reckless attitude toward sex who is the deviant, not the one who wants to connect emotionally with the future sire of her child.   So - while there may or may not be women who feel as Constance does, at the same time it's not so clearly obvious that a woman "should" feel that way, as to justify Lawrence's open belittling of women whose emotional states don't match masculine emotional detachment and distance.  There's a lot of talk of "tenderness" - in fact, Constance keeps mentally accusing everyone in Venice of somehow "lacking tenderness" - but quite frankly I am unclear on what exactly is supposed to be so tender. The only thing he values about her is that he quite clearly likes having sex with her, but even there she only stands out particularly because a good sex partner is so difficult to find.   I can imagine a woman putting up with - but I cannot imagine a woman particularly treasuring - a man who rebuffs her when she wishes to talk, who is rude to her instead of treating her as equal (remembering she's a Lady) when she asks him questions, who calls her c--t as if that were her name, and generally treats her as if she were a whore. I could imagine a woman finding this fun if it were a game they jumped into and out of, but this is how their relationship really is; she spends far too much time begging or wanting to beg him for reassurance - for the things he won't say and the questions he won't answer - for me to find her undiluted enjoyment in their relationship particularly credible.  For what it's worth, I think life will be better when this book has become obsolete. It is exactly this sort of schlock that had women feeling pressured to fake their sexual responses - at great cost to their marriages, if not their selves. Those who agree that heppiness is linked to sexual satisfaction should be in favor of replacing this book with something that deals with sex in a way that reflects female sexuality in an honest and realistic fashion. As for those who just want a good read - I'd call it a matter of personal taste. Obviously some people enjoy this book. (Equally obviously, I did not. 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 This is a terrible book.  The translation juxtaposes English words that are presumably equivalents of the original Chinese ideograms.  The result is incomprehensible.  The English words appear to flow in gramatically  correct sentences but they make no sense.  The translator appears to have  no idea of what the I Ching is about or how it was used in Chinese culture.  Unfortunately, I bought this book and wasted my money 
 Honestly, very few of the agents in this book will even read your work. Thanks to this book, they each receive tons of submissions and can't possibly read them. If you must try it anyway, check your library first. If Writers Digest is so confident in these directories, how come they're not listed in the index? Nor is Brogan.  
 I bought this on the recommendation from Amazon because I've got some Los Lobos CDs I love and it sounded like I would enjoy Latin Playboys.  Wrong!  There are some weird tracks on this where the guys are just experimenting  with their instruments.  I'm not into that at all.  I can go listen to some  buddies messing around in their basement if I want to hear that 
 This brainless, low-budget attempt to cash in on the success of John Carpenter's Vampires was so foul and lame that the studios couldn't even bribe one of their lap-dog "reviewers" to crank out a glowing review for the DVD cover. Or maybe they couldn't afford the kickback--who knows? In any case, the bad casting and inept acting had a kind of narcotic quality like an over-the-counter sleeping pill and the movie had so many plot holes that I used the DVD later to drain my spaghetti. "John Carpenter Presents"--a piece of incredible crap!! Its general level of radioactive badness probably made me sterile 
 According to evidence, astronomy in India, China, and several other cultures developed independently. Indian astronomy wasn't influenced by Greek astronomy until Alexander came to the area. Chinese astronomy has at least an 8,000-year history; later developments suggest collaboration with Iranian cultures, but the oldest stuff is homegrown. So how did this writer determine that this astronomy came from the same source? Where is the archeological and literary provenance?  There isn't any. You have to accept on faith that this person is telling the truth. They aren't, and they didn't check to see whether any of the nonsense they spouted had any relation to evidence 
 I'm sorry, I love Gina Gershon and I was looking forward to watching this movie since I do like action films. But this is such a run of the mill martial arts flick. I wasn't even intrigued to watch the whole thing without hitting the fast forward button through most of the show.  The basis of this movie - the main character is an expert martial artist who comes to town just as a rising of an Aryan militia becomes prominent nearby. It starts with them killing the black preacher everyone loves who promotes people to stop hate, and the white boys in the militia don't like that. *gasp, I never would have guessed*  Main character kicks everyone's behind, gets the girl, acting is horrible and the plot could be pasted to any B flick action film.   Your time could be better spent watching paint dry. Or if you're desperate for something like this then watch Universal Soldier, at least it was funny 
 The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief.  I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz.  This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12.  This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I.  It is a fairytale.  Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.  This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time 
 Although I agree with Mr. Arnold's ultimate conclusion and found his demographic research useful, it should be apparent now that the increase in the DJIA, which the author asserted "must happen," has not materialized.  Where has all the money gone?  Another new bubble has been created- this time in real estate.  I suggest digging your financial foxhole now 
 The authors spend so much space on extended examples that they make the basics difficult to find.  The odd appearance of conditionals is, for instance, the most surprising thing about bash, at least for csh users; their explanation of it is separated by several pages from the main discussion 
 While the Margaret Rutherford portrayals as Miss Marple were highly enjoyable, with welcome splashes of humor, the Geraldine McEwan portrayals are better compared with those by Joan Hickson.  It would be difficult to top Joan Hickson as Miss Marple, and Geraldine McEwan's performances, while credible and enjoyable, aren't nearly as good.  The best aspects of the Acorn Media versions of Miss Marple mysteries are the careful attention to detail in scenery, props, etc.  The interiors of the rooms, seem to be nearly perfection for the period.  The casting was well done as well, and the characters are realistic.  To me, the greatest disappointments in the Acorn Media films are the unnecessary and offensive inclusion of lesbiansism.  The ending of one of the mysteries was even inexcusably changed such that the two people involved with the crimes are lesbians instead of man and a woman.  Without the morally offensive aspects of these films, I would have rated them with at least three, possibly four stars.  Without the wonderful attention to detail in the settings, my rating would have been one star.  Geraldine McEwan is a fine actress.  I'm disappointed that she lowered herself to appear in these versions of Miss Marple mysteries 
 Nothing you can't find on the internet for free.  I have noticed that most of the five star reviews below of this book come from people who have _only_ reviewed other books by Debra Fulghum Bruce.  And oddly enough, each of them have been given five stars too.   Shameful 
 I wanted to order the puzzle sports mats but they do not tell you how many you get with your order.  I also tried the company web site and could not fine info there. 
 Stay away from this translation - it's the pits! The vocabulary is very contemporary and there is no lyricism. The more poetic passages come off as...florid, overheated. There has to be a better translation 
 While this is a good quick reference guide, I have found that I have needed another book for most things.  This would probably be good for kids as long as parents have another source for more detailed reference 
 These books have the most misleading titles! Unless you are teaching Sunday school bible classes, this book is mostly useless, because the only examples it gives you are about how to better teach the bible. The title says 'teach almost anything to pratically anyone'. That is so NOT TRUE. Sure, it gives you some pointers, but I feel I have to squeeze the text really hard to get some juice. I bought this book and 'Almost Every Answer for Practically Any Teacher' hoping to learn how to teach better, and to get in touch with modern teaching skills. What a disappointment and a waste of money! The other book went straight to the garbage can. Another thing: if all the examples of bible teaching were stripped out of the book, it would be half the size and, perhaps, a much more pleasurable read. Maybe it would even earn another star! 
 I've subscribed to Self on-and-off for about 15 years, but have recently been feeling like I've outgrown the magazine. The articles seem to focus on issues facing single women who are just starting their careers.  Fine, but not for me anymore!  Also, their subscription department is terrible!  My most recent subscription has been plagued with missed issues, double issues and late issues -- and a customer service department that can't quite pull themselves together.  
 Despite the fact that this book has been thoroughly dismissed as the pinacle of victimhood mentality and describes a backlash which never happened, despite many of its observations being demonstratedly shown to be baseless and flat out wrong, it still gets reprinted to produce more angry feminist graduates  whose only skill in life is to whine about their systematic oppression while everyone else gets on with their lives making individual choices about their work and family life.  Will somebody please tell them that their convulted oppressive patriarchy disappeared a long time ago and it is only their own victimhood mentality that prevents them from getting ahead in life.       A book only for the true believers and those taking women's studies.  Totally irrelevant to everyone else who takes personal responsibilty for their own choices in life 
 The subtitle of this book is "A Powerful One-Step Plan to Live and Finish Rich." That's a bold statement. Instead of a 9-step plan from Suzie Orman, here we have a one-step plan. So it goes, just do this one thing and you are golden. It turns out there is more than just one step, but the gist of the book is that you should pay yourself first, i.e. setting up automatic payroll deduction and electronic fund transfers for saving, investing, and debt reduction. I'm all for that, even though that idea is nothing new. All 401k plans work this way. There's not much secret in personal finance. So don't expect a magic wand that fixes everything without any sacrifice.  The book says his plan requires "no budget, no discipline, less than ten dollars a day of investment." If only it were that easy! It still requires commitment and re-prioritization. When you want to buy a plasma TV and you don't have money, do you stop your automatic savings or do you forego that TV? Paying yourself first requires commitment. It means you won't be able to have as many nice dinners as you want or do today. It means you won't have leather seats in your car but settle for regular cloth seats. There's no way around that. Automate however you want. At the end of the day, you have to cut your spending. If your spending doesn't come down, you won't be able to continue on your auto-pilot for too long.  The book also gives the illusion that you don't have to save much in order to retire rich. The "less than ten dollars a day" part is totally misleading. Investing $10 a day at 5% after inflation for 40 years gets you about $18,500 a year in retirement income before tax. Not bad, but I don't think anybody can call it Finish Rich if you retire on $18,500 a year. If someone is not saving any money at all, saving $10 a day is better than nothing and we all have to start somewhere. If you really want to Finish Rich, $10/day is not going to cut it. Later in the book the author said you should save 10-15% of your income for retirement. That's a lot better. Saving and investing $7,500 a year on a $50k income at 5% after inflation for 40 years will generate $38,000 a year in retirement income. But that's 40 years. If you want to retire in 30 years, your investments can only generate $21,000 a year. Don't expect that you will be like Jim and Sue McIntyres in the book, at age 52 having two homes paid off free and clear, two kids in college, and a $1 million investment portfolio. I'm sorry to burst the dream, but saving 15% on $50,000 income for 30 years is not going to get you there. It will get you somewhere, a lot farther than where you otherwise would be, but Finishing Rich will require more sacrifice than that.  This book is more on the inspirational side than on the information side, for example his suggestion on bi-weekly mortgage payments is plain bad advice. You should pay off all high rate credit cards and car loans and contribute the maximum allowed to your 401k and Roth IRA before you even consider paying extra on your mortgage. For people who are spending everything they earn and then some, it motivates people toward saving and investing in their 401k plans and Roth IRAs. That's great, even if the numbers don't necessarily add up. If that gets people started on saving for retirement, more power to David Bach! If you are reading other Personal Finance books or blogs, you are probably already contributing to your 401k and Roth IRA. You are not going to gain much insight from this book. David Bach is living proof that a motivational seminar host can package anything into warm and fuzzy book series, workbooks, audio tapes, and live seminars with heavy marketing. People don't want to hear that saving for retirement requires real sacrifices. This book gives them exactly that.  Final verdict: 2-stars, Fair, skip, you won't miss anything 
 Using the borrowed style of Ann Coulter (who he thinks is witty and smart and funny), Bernie has written a clunker. Let's not mistake this book for anything less than what it is - a smear book. The kind Bill O'Reilly was rallying against when written by a lefty, but brings the author on to rave about when written by a conservative. Here - the title makes it seem like he will have an honest debate. Instead it is all about the left, and how the right will not take it anymore.  The targets are the usual suspects, but the main target no longer is Michael Moore (your remember the 100 people screwing up America book where all but a handful were liberals - and included television hosts of info-mercials!), but is Rosie O'Donnell. Somewhere along the lines, she became public enemy number one. There is nothing new in this book that you cannot read online, or hear on any conservative radio program. You know the drill. 1) There is a liberal bias in the media. 2) Rosie and others work for the Democratic party. 3) Liberals get together and go over talking points (must be since they cannot have a thought of their own according to Bernie). 4) We hate Rush because he is successful. It has nothing to do with him being a racist, sexist, or overall piece of trash drug user. I read these books, and usually my blood boils. This one could not get any reaction like that. Take it for what it is - a political book that tries to be funny, and fails. 
 I was quite disappointed with this film.  The director used some non-actors to play some of the parts, and it shows.  Also, the editing and camera work is shoddy.  In one particular scene, you see Mouchette turning her body, which causes a coffee cup to move toward the edge of the table.  In the next shot, the cup falls to the floor.  The effect is very self-conscious and clumsy.  Finally, the actress playing the girl fails to convince us of her state of mind that occurs at the fim's end.  Perhaps other viewers may like it 
 This film is disappointing, considering the acting talent used in it.  The story is about a cop whose son gets into some trouble, and is supposedley framed.  His father, the cop (DeNiro) must try to stay within the boundaries of his job while at the same time clear his troubled sons name of the crime.  It is not very suspenseful and the end result, regardless what avenue they take, is dull.  There is no wonder for who really committed the crime, who framed who, or who will come out the victor in the end of the movie.  It just falls flat and it's to bad that DeNiro wasted his time and talents being in this film.  If you want some great crime drama films that push this to shame, try recent movies like Along came a spider, Man on Fire, or Collateral.  Deeper plots without the predictable outcomes 
 I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.   Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie.  This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch 
 First I will say that JAK was not previously on my must buy list and judging from this book she will not be there any time in the near future.  For me, the characters were undeveloped and uninteresting and at many times annoying.  I didn't even like the dog and I have now been informed over and over that jogging will ruin my knees.  The mystery part of the book seemed almost like it was thrown in as a second thought and made absolutely no sense.  I thoroughly enjoy a well-developed romantic mystery but this is certainly not one.  I might give JAK another chance sometime but hopefully I have helped save someone's time with this title. 
 I listened first to the Power of Intention, which was the reason I purchased the Secrets of the Power of Intention.  I found the Secrets of the Power of Intention to be a long version of the Power of Intention, by far the Power of Intention is a disc that will fire up ones sense and the drive to learn more and more.  The Secrets of the Power of Intention is BORING and makes you upset that you even purchased the set, it bring little to lite over the first disc.  I would love to return the disc's, not worth the money 
 Here are some words from the Big Printer in the Sky:  "The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak." -Hans Hoffman  By the time I got to the dynamite the gun powder was wet and soggy 
 This guy is pretty much in the same league as Jack Kirby. Whereas Kirby's all soft lines and images pancaked on the page, Dore looks like he's carving his cartoons into a tree. And all these scary demons and things look tired, like they've been running marathons all day. The victims kind of look like they're enjoying it, so I guess if you're into S&M, I could recommend it. Me, I prefer "Spawn" by Todd McFarlane. The Violator? Now that's a monster you can sink your eyeballs into. And I know it's like super-uber hip, but I don't know why these illustrators feel they are so special when they work exclusively in shades of black. Like my momma used to say, "A little rouge really accents the cheekbones. 
 This book does not give answers or examples to do most of the activities.  For example, on the descriptive writing chapter, it does not provide sample vocabulary to describe smell or taste.  Instead, it tells the learner to consult a dictionary 
 The clock lost time from the minute I plugged it in. It progressively lost minutes everyday. When it was 30 minutes slow I sent it back and received a new one that also lost time immediately after being plugged in. I waited a week and it was now 45 minutes slow. Contacted DeLonghi directly and they offered to send me the same model but a different serial number. That one also lost time. Contacted DeLonghi again, they then replaced the unit with a different model DC55TCB. this one the water does not drip through the grinds. They are now sending us a new basket to hopefully solve the problem. Well, we received the new basket unit and the water with coffee still does not drip through. Contacted DeLonghi and was asked to cut the cord and send it in and they would sent another replacement unit in 3 to 6 weeks. This will be our 5th unit. We aksed for a refund but were told they cannot do that!!!!!!Meanwhile we have purchased a unit through Gevalia and will keep getting replacements til they get it right!!!!!! This will be our 5th. Received a new unit on 1/4/07 and yet again the water failed to drip through the filter, contacted DeLonghi was told we weren't positionung the carafe correctly???? I am not a Harvard graduate however I do kn ow how to place a carafe into the unit. They said they will send out yet another basket unit. We received the basket and still the same problem. I finally contacted Amazon and pled my case to them, so much for dealing with the manufacturer directly. They authorized a return even though this unit is a replacement for the original defective one. I know who reads this must be tired by now and has given up, as have I 
 I first heard word of the track "Fly" in a review of Arf! Arf! Records' "A Heavy Dose of Lite Psych" compilation in Mojo magazine. The reviewer vowed that this track was worth the price of admission by itself, everything else was bonus. I was intrigued by the description of "what Radiohead may have sounded like in the Summer of Love". Receiving the compilation CD, I immediately listened to this track and completely fell in love with it. When I heard the album had been re-released, I jumped at the chance to buy it. I have to admit I set myself up for disappointment. The only other tracks that come close to comparing are "Land of Sensations and Delights" (little more than two minutes), "Christine" and "The Times". None of these tracks can match "Fly", however, and many of the others sound like Jay forgot to write the rest of the song (like the last track on side 1, "Nobody", if I remember correctly). It's still interesting, but I would not rate it as five stars. I'm hoping I'm not misled with Aerovons and Gandalf (both of which I'm getting ready to buy, and comparisons to the Beatles and the Zombies are enjolling me to buy these) 
 Is it just me, or does this CD sound horrible in comparison to the release on actual audio tape? It sounds very tinny on CD. Furthermore, they removed the most interesting, hilarious track, the one where Danzig improvs his "Bobby Steele's an a-hole" lyrics during Teenagers from Mars. That was half the reason I bought this, and was very annoyed to find it missing. 
 Perhaps I might have a high expectation, but correct me if I am wrong, this movie is quite bad. Besides the poor low-tech special effect, those actors and actresses really seem not knowing how to act. The plot doesn't make sense and never explains the cause and effect of the flies. This is a movie will make you shake your head at the end 
 Okay so this review is a bit premature being that I've read up to the 16th page so far but I am highly irritated by all the complex words the author is using---especially for a story of BASKETBALL. The wording is making it difficult for the story to flow 
 Please do not be put off from reading other John Irving novels because of the negative reviews, including mine, of "Until I Find You." Absolutely check out "The World According to Garp, "A Prayer For Owen Meany, or "Cider House Rules." Irving is masterful at creating unique, quirky, endearing characters. But not in this one. Any likable character in this novel is miniscule and rare. In addition, I am still pondering Irving's eerily light treatment of the overwhelming amount of child abuse his main character Jack has to sustain. Sexual abuse is dished out by practically every girl or woman Jack encounters.  This makes for a depressing book that also seemed to go on far too long. That said, I strongly recommend this author as one of the best at walking the thin line between comedy and tragedy 
   I watched the film in the theater when it came out, was very disappointed in all the inaccuracies. Trying to "entertain"/ educate people on a subject matter so serious with a plot so ludicrous is irresponsible at best. The Pet Dog was cute but also unrealistic. The book "The Gold Crew" had a more believable plot.    Having served on a few Ballistic Missile Submarines, I find it an insult to the Crews of the Boats Especially to the Captains and officers.   It's Understandable why the Navy Refused to Bless this. By placing there seal of approval on this film they would be saying it could happen, which it couldn't as depicted. Too much control and too many people in the loop to allow it.   From November 15, 1960-May 25, 2001. The Navy completed 3500 Deterrent Patrols which roughly equates to 671 years of combined ship service on alert ready to launch. And there Still out there boring holes in the water  
 I was going to buy this, but I was reading the reviews and I would have been LIVID.  I grew up with this music and in MY opinion, I like the MONO sound better than the stereo mixes because sometimes they can ruin the sound.  Like for instance. On the Temptations "Get Ready" cd.  Did you notice that "Say You" is in MONO but the rest of the stuff is in stereo.  And who ever mixed "Fading Away" killed it.  They brought the violins up way too high during the instrumental part. I will have to admit, the stereo of "This old heart of mines" (on the album by the Isley Bros" is a much crisper cleaner sound than the MONO version.   Man, i was going to buy this but the more reviews I read, the more i did not want it. So I'll stick to Motown's Ultimate Collection.       Thank you all for your realness and honesty about this 
 This author understands absolutely nothing about Russian or Soviet history.  If you wish to worship Ronald Reagan, this is the book for you!  If you want to understand Russian and Soviet politics, history (warts and all) don't waste your time, you will find almost total propaganda.    His comments and quotes from Gorbachev, however, are appreciated. It is about time Americans got over their "gorby love".  I saw this author on BookTV -- he cannot even pronounce Russian names correctly, let alone get very much right about Russian people and Soviet life (one example:  Russian churches were open to the public and widely attended during the Soviet period, even if Lenin and Marx were absolutely right about religion!)  Finally, this author fails to discuss how that sick triumvarate of Thatcher, Reagan and Gorbachev are very much responsible for a terrible upsetting of the power balance in the world, which has got us the mess we have today.  Russia and the former republics are in a pathetic state of ruin. Regions formerly controlled by the Soviets (including Afghanistan)are overrun with terrorists, resulting already in great tragedy, and who knows what will come next.  And this author waxes *poetic'* about how much "credit" should be given to such insanity.  The author is either utterly deluded or supremely stupid. 
 I wanted to purchase a lot of postcards and with this item, it seemed to me that I could get a lot for a little. But, in actuality, these aren't even real postcards!!! THIS BOOK IS MADE OF "PICTURES OF POSTCARDS". It even says 'reproduced in actual size' as if I was getting a postcard book of boring postcards. Don't buy this unless you like looking at pictures of postcards and not actually using them 
 While the book is funny and drew my interest in what would happpen, it was ultimately sterile and uninvolving. Quite a disappointment from the author of two of my favorites, "Julian" and "Creation". I get that it is (among other things) a satire on the dry, lifeless, oh too clever world of Post-Modernism. This still does not redeem it from being dry, lifeless, or oh too clever. Granted it archly satirizes much of what is wrong in modern American life, but that only gets you so much credit 
 In a true window into the workings of Amazon, I can't rate this volume because it hasn't been released by the publisher yet.  Amazon knows this but is so highly automated that one hand doesn't know what the other is doing.     Bravo! Amazon : 
 Juvenile has been at the bottom and the top in his career.  He marinated on the underground until Cash Money exploded into the rap arena as well as mainstream radio in the mid-to-late 90s.  But then people got tired of hearing the same ole product that the label had to offer.  Even labelmates were getting sick of each other and the politics that was going down, leaving some to either depart or find other ways of getting their name out there.  B.G. went the independent route, holding on to a small fraction of the fans he had when he was a Hot Boy.  Turk followed suit, but soon found himself behind bars instead of spitting bars.  Juvenile found himself going the solo route, although he did briefly return in 2003 for Juve The Great.  Now with Atlantic, Juvi has some catching up to do with his newest release Reality Check.  "Get Your Hustle On" is the perfect track to start off the album because it shows that Juvenile knows what he needs to do to get ahead.  "I Know You Know" with Trey Songz is a good contender for the radio.  "Around The Way" is a song for the hood to know that he ain't never left and he doesn't plan to either.  "Sets Go Up" with Wacko is so-so, while his first single "Rodeo" is the millennium version of "Back That [...] Up" only with a more subdued approach.  Unfortunately the album takes a nosedive from there.  "What's Happenin'" is nothing to write home about, "Loose Booty" is another song devoted to the [...]-shaking community, and "Break A Brick Down" deliberately borrows a beat from another Cash Money track. "Who's Ya Daddy" is pointless, along with the annoying "Keep Talkin'" with Skip and Redd Eyezz and "Why Not."  Bun B makes another poor decision by collaborating on "Rock Like That."  The biggest shocker has to be "Addicted" with Brian McKnight making a dumb career move. Not only does Brian sing vulgar lyrics for the first time (and hopefully his last,) but Juvenile decides to talk his verses instead of rapping them (think Oran Juice Jones when he was cussing the chick out at the end of "The Rain.")    There are a lot of other dreadful songs on Reality Check that I'm not even going to bother mentioning.  This has to be the worst disc that Juvenile has ever put together in recent memory.  With an occasional track here and there that is even tolerable, Reality Check is not something you want to cop unless you are his biggest fan and can't live with yourself if you don't buy the album.  One thing is for sure...Juvenile better consider a legitimate reality check if he wants to stay in the rap game for years to come.  
 Other reviewers have pointed out the errors Eric Alterman makes in this book, like saying that the U.S. was under the Kyoto Protocol.  That was particularly annoying.  He needs to stop writing his books on the back of cocktail napkins 
 I tried to embrace this book--I really did. It was tempting to want to have at last found a piece of academic writing that deftly encapsulates and explains this clash of titans: jihad and globalism. Barber's main title is, however, more tantalizing than explanatory. This book demonstrates the dangers of allegiance to dichotomies; there are other forces at work in society that grapple with the headline-stealing titans.  This is an important book at least insofar as it captures a growing sentiment among academics interested in the socio-economic forces that compel current events. It is not, therefore, an easy read for the layman (particularly the last part of the book) which is ironic given his call to grassroots citizen action.   Barber asserts--really insists with an uncomfortable brand of academic arrogance--in almost narrowly political overtones that the world is immersed in a battle of opposing ideologies: the corporate, amoral and homogenized one that really is without ideology and the local, or tribal, and rigidly moral and fragmented one that is part ideology, part myth-making.  Unfortunately, in his earnestness to construct and defend his convenient dichotomy, he conforms exceptions to his rule. The jihadists--whether ethnic hatemongers or terrorists--have for Barber retained some residue of moral dignity while the globalist--whether gullible, materialistic and indifferent consumers or manipulative, multinational executives--have altogether lost their moral compass.  His solution (which he fails to outline, thus making his work more of a polemic and manifesto rather than manual for change) is an activist citizenry fully appreciative of their need and ability to shore up the civil sector of modern societies. Here again Barber is remiss, revealing that writing from one's desk rather than the field has its limitations. He fails to acknowledge, for example, the extent to which the lack of a civic tradition in such nations as Russia and China impedes social progress of the sort he pines for. And the following further indicates his lack of awareness of Chinese cultural resiliency: "What is striking is that even here where a native culture might be thought to have its greatest chances against the children of the Western Enlightenment, McWorld seems irresistible."(190)  Aside from this concern, and his lack of concrete solutions and elusive, often inaccessible writing style, Barber tends to exaggerate the extent to which corporate influence is mitigated by both government and civic organizations, especially in the Western democracies. He is undeservedly far too pessimistic in this regard and fails to note the many ways in which a bygone American lacked a collective sense of civic duty. Moreover, his analysis is flawed, as I believe you will also discover, by his apparent aspirations to global citizenship. Nor, as other reviewers have noted, has he given due credit to the government and business sectors in creating a climate for a civic society to exist, must less flourish with some degree of autonomy. The symbolic assault on McDonald's is both tedious and unfair. While guilty of promoting unhealthy diets to some extent, it is a zealous stretch to accuse this and other multinationals of single handedly distorting the cultural landscape of developing nations. And even in the U.S., McDonald's has played a civic role via the Ronald McDonald House, it's management hiring practices and provisions for inner-city employment.  This book, perhaps like this review, could have been thought out more and condensed considerably. For a far better articulated review of this book see Gary Rosen's piece online from the journal First Things 
 Shawn Hatosy (The Faculty, Outside Providence) is in love with Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That, Antitrust) but she doesnt love him, she only wants to be his friend, then enter Hatosy's friend, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (Tv's Elvis, Velvet Goldmine) who becomes Cook's boyfriend and Hatosy becomes jealous from this....who hasnt gotten made when a friend seduces the girl you love....you know what, who cares really. Hatosy tells the story in flashback telling the story to cop Lorraine Bracco (The Sopranos, Medicine Man). This boring story has no likable characters and invokes really thin interest with me. Cook is really stale, Hatosy, as much as a good actor he is is rendered dull and Meyers plays another sleaze ball like in most of his thrillers. Worth a look and by god Im not looking again and towards the end you're like....WHY I DID I RENT THIS?!!. Also starring Estella Warren (Planet of the Apes remake). 
 I love Bill James. His best books (the 1980s and Historical Abstracts) can be read again and again, although James himself would probably yell at you if you did so, telling you to stop reading and start thinking for yourself. Rob Neyer is a talented writer but basically interchangeable with 1,000 other journalists.  This book features too little of James' wit and wisdom and too much of Neyer's modestly-interesting-but-not-worth-paying-$15.00-for essays and commentary.  And although the book is almost 500 pages long, more than 60 percent of the text consists of thumbnail sketches of pitchers from 1870 to the present.  These sketches provide the pitchers' height, weight, record, selected statistics, years active, key pitches, and (sometimes) a contemporaneous quote or two regarding the pitcher or an explanatory note.  In short, precious little that's not in other books like Total Baseball or already available online.  Of course, if you REALLY want to know whether Sig Jakucki threw a curve, then you'll find that here and perhaps nowhere else.  For good reason.  Keeping to form, James' essays are all entertaining riffs finding new ways to study pitches, pitchers, pitching and our perception of same using quantitative tools. With the exception of an essay challenging conventional opinions on pitcher "abuse," however, there are few of the myth-debunking studies for which James is deservedly respected.   
 but that is about all, there is not much information on anything in the book, i think it is for those who are just entering the world of Anim 
 I tried maybe 10 recipes in this book, and they were all horrible.  On a positive note, I can say that the recipes make huge portions on extremely little money, so this would be a great depression cookbook.  The very worst were the sauces, with "Sauerbraten Sauce" taking the cake for the most disgusting.  A hot dog, mac & cheese, and jello is a cheap meal too, and tastes a whole lot better than anything in this book.  Also, even though these recipes are low fat, they are not low calorie as they are loaded with sugar (for example, "Kix" bar cookies (Kix cereal and TONS of white Karo...not something that would work for your average dieter).  I had this book for 1 month and threw it away.  
 This was a complete waste of money.  A little phamplet of a book written by a very spoiled woman who is in love with herself more than anyone else 
 Horrible book.  The racist continues his trend of substandard writing 
 This cd has nothing that old Moonspell used to have. It's too watered down and artistic. It really seems like they tried a little too hard to be "unique" and ended up being boring. I am pretty dissapointed 
 AGELESS BODY is Deepak's attempt to neutralize the word "old" as in old age.  The writer has a knack for making common words, like "body, "mind" and "self," into profound concepts.  His technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies.  But ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound.  	If you like poetry, Deepak may be your read: "The billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life; (P. 36)"  Or try to interpret this one: "The emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe; in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born. (P.40)"   	At times he attributes to cells and DNA a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible.  He would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over "intelligent design."  He can't accept the growth of any cell, even a plant cell, without an intelligence involved.  He mentions and attacks evolution only one time on P. 115, asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process.  	Deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms: Intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself.  Whether your word game tosses in the word "quantum" or not doesn't change much.  What a solipsistic thought; what a solipsistic world.  I wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness Deepak speaks of wouldn't, after awhile, go insane 
 I purchased this book because it was assigned as a part of a literature curriculum for 7th Grade. I am very glad that I read this book before allowing my 12 year old son to read it. This book is about gang violence (although it is initially sugar coated as being fairly harmless pranks assigned to frightened students by one of the gang leaders.)  The book is also about angry, jaded, hateful teachers and administrators in a religious school and how they allow the gang to function in order to serve their own purposes.   The ending has the one student who stood up against the gang being beaten up quite severely for his disobedience (while the administrator of the school looks on from a nearby hill.)   Before he is taken away in the ambulance, the student tries to tell his one and only friend to just do what the gang and the faculty want him to do.   The message here is do not buck the system, no matter how corrupt the system is. Within the first few pages the book refers to masturbation.  (Another re-curring topic.)  I knew that it was questionable whether or not I would allow my son to read this book.  I read the entire book myself hoping that there would be a redeming message in the end that would justify the rest of the book.  There isn't.   This is the first book that I have ever thrown away rather than passing on to someone else. Save your money.  I don't care how many awards this book received.  It is pure trash 
 The Mysteries of Udolpho is beautifully written.  Ann Radcliffe writes page after page, after page...of picturesque descriptions of Italy and France's countryside.   That being said, I found The Mysteries of Udolpho to be long winded and drawn out.  The first two volumes are rather mind-numbing and I skimmed over much of it.  I never felt a connection towards Emily and felt rather indifferent towards her well being.  I found her to be rather insipid and became tired of her constant fits of weeping and fainting.  Her servant, Annette, was more intriguing than Emily and her pathetic weakness. I would personally recommend skipping The Mysteries of Udolpho to read Sheridan Le Fanu's novel Uncle Silas.  Young Maud finds herself in similiar circumstances but approaches them with not only grace and sweetnss but a strength that she "finds from a place unknown" to herself.  You will cheer for Maud in a way that seems impossible to do for Emily 
 Count the number of dancers in those spectacular dance sequences.  It is amazing.  Every student at Tate College must have danced in them.  The "Pass That Peacepipe" and final "Good New" numbers I have on constant re-run, never tire of seeing them

 I already knew that Michael Savage was a draft dodger since I always check the New Hampshire Chickenhawk Database. From some reason they do not have his birthday. According to the official "Name Authority" from the Library of Congress database, his real name is Michael A. Weiner and he was born March 31, 1942. But why is he a hypocrit regarding American soldiers like me?  Dr. Weiner/Savage does the usual butter-me-up, like on page 104. He talks about former Hollywood actors who served in WWII, "True American heroes yes...They, unlike the empty suits of today, fought shoulder-to-shoulder alongside America's finest young boys. The farmers, the steelworkers, the taxi drivers. The people who made this country great." The only problem here is that he is describing MY family and not his.  His image of former soldiers is extremely negative and very offensive to me. In describing a veteran expressing his true feelings about war "war is awful..he never wanted to fight, he didn't believe in fighting although he wore the uniform [what do you mean Weiner?] and yes he was a hero and has many medals even though he naver actually fought." This isn't even the pot calling the kettle black. "Their anti-war comments both undermine our troops' morale and encourage our enemies by creating a picture of a divided front." Weiner also states, "[t]he ill-informed comments of these camera-craving, ex-military types in the attempt to prop-up a sagging self-esteem, do extensive damage to the war on terror and our military." Keep that second comment in mind, but who is the guy with the self-esteem problem? He doesn't have any "fake" medals so who is he to criticize a person who actually served?  If anybody is harming our troops it is Weiner/Savage. On page 88 he actually tells us it is okay for al-Qaida to kill our soldiers. Really. "If you were a leader or an intellectual in the Muslim world and you saw the debauchery promulgated by the West...and saw your young people gravitating toward the filth pumped over your airwaves, what would you do? Frankly you would support al-Qaida or any organization [like al-Qaida in Iraq or the Taliban in Afghanistan?] that would want to stop that flood of pollution from entering your country." Thanks for clearing up why it is okay for these guys to kill our soldiers. And here I thought they just hated our freedoms.   There are other problems with this book. On page 108 he decries the "intense use of drugs." Yeah, like Limbaugh's abuse of Oxycontin that he forgot to mention. Most diturbing to me is his use of words such as "sheeple," which is word coined by racist Aryan Nations members. Why he would use a favorite word of anti-Semites, seeing as how Weiner/Savage is a Jew, as well as a word used extensively by Timothy McVey is quite strange. He also uses dismissive language like "leg-crossers," (page 85)which I assume is a substitute for "bitch." And, finally, for all of you steelworkers, taxi drivers, etc., who are his fans: this guy thinks you're dumb. All you need to do is read page 106 to see what he thinks about opinions of non-college graduates.  As one last snipe on this guy, I just love that photo of him (all photos are of him) in the book, under the line "my ship has come in." That is one big yacht he is at the helm of. To his question of where to steer his yacht, how about towards the Gulf and to join the fight? I did ny combat, now you do yours. 
 This is one of the most boring films I ever watched. There is nothing erotic in it. The whole story is perverted with a poor, innocent but very stupid woman submitting to the sadist fantasies of various "lovers" she is introduced. I put inverted comas in lovers because none of them have a single tender erotic moment with her, but instead they brutally beat her and rape her in the presence of others, who seem to be totally oblivious to the proceedings 
 My major problem with this book is not that Shahak is biased, or that he transparently uses Orthodox Judaism as a stepping-stone to attack anything Jewish (or Zionist) he dislikes. What I take issue with is Shahak's blatant disregard for facts, and refusal to use anything resembling an academic standard in proving his case.  Obviously, there are elements within Judaism that can be perceived (or interpreted) as chauvinist. There is quite a bit about contemporary Ultra-Orthodox Jewish theology or politics that many people, Jews and non-Jews, can dislike. Similarly, there is much about current Israeli policies one can disagree with. To argue such things is in no way anti-semitic or anti-Zionist.  However, this is not what Shahak does. Rather, he systematically repeats (thereby giving credence to) age-old anti-semitic lies and falsifications, rubber-stamping them without providing any proof. Many of Shahak's most egregious charges and characterizations about Orthodox belief, practice, or history (such as allegations that in 19th century Russia, Jewish 'heretics' were regularly murdered by their Orthodox counterparts) cannot even be checked or challenged, because he does not provide any sources for them.  Most of Shahak's condemnations follow a similar pattern- he will use citations for one or two general facts, and then will make a ridiculous statement which he doesn't back up.  Many angry denunciations are nothing short of knocking down strawmen, seemingly revolving around the author's own bizarre (and un-cited or explained) interpretations, such as Isaiah 1:15: "'And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear:  your hands are full of blood.' Since Jewish priests 'spread their hands' when blessing the people during service, this verse is supposed to mean that a priest who commits accidental homicide is disqualified from 'spreading his hands' in blessing (even if repentant) because they are 'full of blood'."  Shahak gives no notes to the reader to support this interpretation. We have no way of knowing his source, or if the verse is, in fact, even interpreted as referring to physical murder in the first place (as opposed to being metaphoric). We are just expected to "take his word for it". That a professor of ANYTHING would deign to write a book using such shoddy scholarship is rather appalling, and demonstrates an insulting disregard for his subject, principles of intellectual honesty, and his readership. He seemingly expects the reader to accept everything he says on faith, and apparently many do, after all, "he's Jewish". For those who know a little about what he's (attempting) to talk about, however, his intellectual slight-of-hand is quickly exposed.  Many of Shahak's so-called facts can be easily disproved using only a modicum of research. For instance, the sentence, "Everywhere, classical Judaism developed hatred and contempt for agriculture as an occupation..."  This is simply untrue. The great Talmudic commentator Rashi, mentioned on almost every page of the Talmud and idolized among Orthodox society, owned a vineyard, and included many references to agriculture in his commentaries. Furthermore, at every point when Jews were not prohibited from farming land in Europe, Jewish farmers existed (including my own ancestors). Shahak is, in simplest terms, lying.  For those who come to Shahak's book trying to learn more about Judaism, I strongly urge you to go somewhere else, which is both more reputable among Jewish sources, as well as (at a bare minimum,) tells you where it gets its information. The only people that can "benefit" from this book are Jew-haters wanting to find some evidence, however flimsy, to back up their prejudices, or people actually knowledgeable about Judaism who get their kicks reading anti-semitic propaganda 
 I can't stand Adam Sandler's movies but his albums have always been consistently funny.  This is the most inconsistently funny album he's ever produced.  A few of the laugh out loud skits include "Gay Robot", "Sid and Alex" and "Calling Home"; the charcters in the latter skit seem to be all played by Sandler and his voices and lines are gut-bustingly funny.  And "Gay Robot" is just plain hilarious.  Of course, this has its fair share of singing from Sandler and "Secret" is, by far, the funniest.  Unfortunately, most of the rest of these skits are so tired and boring that you have to wonder if Sandler hasn't hit a wall as far as his album creativity goes.  "Wolfman" is SO painfully unfunny that you just end up squirming uncomfortably waiting for something remotely amusing to materialize.  And the Pibb skits, his latest recurring character, are just dumb and flat.  Some skits even reach the realm of irritating such as "Creepin' On The Mayor" which involves a character hiding in a garbage can from people who want to beat him up.  That's it.  Wow, that's funny.   You're better off focusing on just five or six tracks and ditching the rest (Sid and Alex, Gay Robot, Secret, Boss and the Secretary, Mule Session, Newlyweds-Sleepyheads, and Calling Home should do it for you).  Oh, and a quick response to all of the people who are obsessed with this album being "dirty".  Have you people been asleep for the past 13 years??  That's what makes a Sandler album is his filthy and lewd talk!  Sandler's funniest bits are the dirty ones and it's always been that way 
 I am a great admirer of some of Steinbeck's books. Grapes of Wrath is among my top ten.  East of Eden is unspeakably bad. It thrashes cliches out until they smell of putrefaction. The brother conflict, rather than being a modernization of the first biblical murder story, is an exaggeration in kitsch than can hardly be surpassed. So is the story of the incredible evil woman, the mother. So is the good Chinese in his great goodness. It makes me grow new goose bumps just to remember the extremes that Steinbeck went into as far as sentimentality goes. There is not a single real person in here. The book is a rambler. It walks about the countryside of it's story like a gentleman with nothing better to do. It gives you heaps of little pearls that wait for the rescue from the swine. It throws aphorisms at you when you start drowning in the pulp. In Germany we had a special genre for this kind of writing: the Heimatroman. This is one. I enjoyed and cursed it till the end. And then I watched the movie. Boy, was James Dean a bad actor, you wouldn't believe it. It got an Oscar in it's days as best movie? Oh boy. There is absolutely nothing right in the movie. And that made me realize the difference: the movie is so bad, you can not possibly stand it till the end. The book however is a monument of artistic provocation. I couldn't put it away. I dumped the DVD though 
 All of the title cards issued on the following DVD are recreated and are NOT ORIGINAL (except for one exception):  Walt Disney Treasures - Mickey Mouse in Black and White  The titles for the 1928-1929 cartoons should read:  Celebrity Productions, Inc. Present A Mickey Mouse Sound Cartoon  Celebrity Productions, Inc. has been changed to "Disney Cartoons"   On the Columbia Shorts: The original Columbia logo has been removed from all these cartoons as well as the music that went with it. If you have the old laser disk set you will notice that the music is intact on those but the Columbia logo is also missing.  On the title card itself: Columbia Pictures has been added but you can tell the cards are redrawn because of the words on the bottom of the title card ...which are not the words that were originally on the title card.    The only original title card  is that at the end of the Columbia  Mickey Mouse cartoons - which for some reason whoever was responsible for this DVD did not have drawned.  The United Artists cartoons are all missing: Joseph M. Schenck Presents A  from the title card and have therefore been redrawn or modified.. 
 I picked this book up from a local bookstore because it was flagged with a "recommondation" tag, and I've discovered some pretty great authors following the recommendations there.  Unfortunately, this one was a bust.  After reading the first 50 pages or so, I noticed the pull quote on the cover that announces "Swordspoint has an unforgettable opening and just gets better from there."  In all honesty, I couldn't really remember how the book began, and I'd been reading it for less than an hour.  There are two main problems with this "historical fantasy" work.  The first is the workmanlike prose.  Characters always speak with adverbs tacked on to force the tone.  Here's a quick recap of one such conversation that covers about five paragraphs of text thanks to the long stretches of dialog:  xxxxxx she said fondly.  xxxxxx said Michael with an impish grin.  xxxxxx the duchess said dryly.  xxxxxx Lady Godwin said firmly.  xxxxxx the duchess was saying consolingly. Now, everything is serviceable enough -- nice, adjective-laden descriptions, a metaphor here and there, but there's not a lot of creativity in the author's style.  After a while, it feels like reading a newspaper article.  The second problem is the plot.  The author was aiming for a kind of "Les Liasons Dangereuses," with lots of court intrigue and subtle positioning in the complex fight for political power.  But to pull that off, you really need some kind of mystery or subterfuge that keeps the reader guessing, or at least holds his/her interest.  There's really none of that in Swordspoint... the "court intrigue" is incredibly blunt, more like a daytime soap than a good movie 
 Eh..  this book was ok. interesting in the fact that it was written by a woman who is a "professional sex surrogate". if that's not a euphimism, I don't know what is.  written from a female perspective, it may seem to be an easy thing to do as she suggests, and some of her male 'colleagues' are reported to be doing these tightening maneuvers, however, just as some people may be able to roll their R's, their tongues, or cross their eyes, others simply cannot, for whatever reason.  I just think a little more disclosure would be prudent to avoid returns - :D  
 Decent book if you are looking for information on the various types of welding, related equipment, etc.  Too academic if you are looking for practical information to help you start welding.  The question/answer format was a little annoying.  I felt like I was back in college taking a test 
 I bought this album determined not to pay attention to any negative reviews from this site or any other. I have never been proven so wrong in my life. This album is inexcusably bad. Ths following review sums it up exactly.  21 of 36 people found the following review helpful:   Deplorable......!, September 20, 2005 Reviewer: Brendan "Bren" (New York) - See all my reviews  Whoever is the creative genius behind this miss matched MESS of a tribute should be fired immediately from whatever label or organization commissioned this album. Nostalgia aside, never have I heard such an amazing, talented group of performers (some of them amongst my favourites - Aretha Franklin, Beyonce, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys, John Legend, Patti LaBelle, Angie Stone) sound so unprepared, vocally dull, poorly produced and karaoke-like! Talk about the right singers singing the WRONG SONGS and then the wrong singers singing the RIGHT SONGS - who had the GALL to give 'Never too much' to MARY J. BLIGE??? And 'Superstar' to USHER???? USHER????? Of all the incredible R&B singers in existence, including the completely acceptable version by Ruben Studdard, you will give a classic like 'Superstar' to USHER??? Unreal. This whole project just sounds like/ reeks music biz politics to me....my baby Fantasia, Im sorry, this is the worst thing I have ever heard her sing and I think Fantasia is incredible. And what da *!@#!! is that bunch of musical MESSES in between - Celine Dion (mediocre)/ Donna Summer (a remix nightmare) Wyclef Jean (unspeakable) Beyonce & Stevie (boring, and I LOVE those two) Aretha Franklin (a la Divas Live solo - all over the place)/ Babyface (boring) Patti LaBelle (predictable) - oh my goodness. Too much. BARELY saving the album by sheer musicality and good singing - John Legend - truly an original sound - Angie Stone and JAMIE FOXX (would you believe?). Still - not the right songs to really make them shine. What a headache...  And perhaps the most absymal act of wanton disregard - WHERE WAS LUTHER'S FRIEND, BACKGROUND SINGER, PERFORMER EXTRAORDINAIRE AND CONFIDANTE ON THIS PROJECT - LISA FISCHER????? Abysmal I say again.  Suggestion - next Luther Vandross tribute - and Im sure there will be in a year or two - keep some of Luther's friends...but please take some TIME to match the right song with the right singer....and some NEW, INTERESTING voices please...do some research - there are people out there who are amazing, unrecognised or yet unknown talents that would complement any tribute....LEDISI, RACHELLE FERRELL, RAUL MIDON, MELONIE DANIELS, WILL DOWNING, LEELA JAMES, LIZZ WRIGHT and a couple of undiscovered underground R&B/ Jazz gems right here in New York, Abby Dobson, Cole Williams, R'kardo, Gordon Chambers, Lynn Lockamie, Ryan Shaw, Sasha Allen and the list goes on and on....singers who work tirelessly at their craft and consistently give great work...  I am appalled. May Luther rest in peace, and not turn in his grave at this slapdash atrocity that does not give any valid credence to the magnificent body of work this artiste of standard has left to the world - as his legacy. 
 I have been suffering from panic and anxiety since I was 4 years old.  This book was recommended by my therapist, and I found it tremendously panic-inducing!  It's a little dense, and there's a very thick section in the beginning which just describes panic over and over and over again... !!!!!  Sometimes, I've found that reviewing the symptoms of panic can actually get me to calm down.  I realize that these are just symptoms, and they'll go away when I can calm down.  Not so with this book.  It makes me too nervous, and I have to put it down.  I've never been able to read more than a few pages without feeling sick.  It's utterly useless, in my opinion, to those it's trying to help.  May be a good read for the spouse or partner of a suffering person.  Have someone read it and give you the information 
 Excited. Popped it in the DVD player. Opening sequence, perfect. Scene 2, no audio. Scene 3&4, had audio. Scene 5, no audio. Do not purchase unless you enjoy: closed captioning, lip reading, or returning DVDs to Amazon 
 The very title for the book - "I Con" - despite its cleverness, should reveal the lack of any objectivity, or class for that matter, from the authors, Jeffrey S. Young & William L. Simon. I could best describe this book as a shoddy pastiche of ambiguous-sounding facts, poor research, colored by a palpable disdain for [arguably the most interesting legend of our time] Steve Jobs.  What is really distasteful is that this antipathy of the authors towards Steve Jobs, seems 'personal'; which, in a democratic sense, may be alright i guess, [but only] UNTIL facts begin to wear thin, and the research seems doctored, leaving the rants sounding hollow, unsavory and shrill. And the facts aren't well-strung together either!  From the very opening description in the book, which overdramatizes and harps on about the return of a "reformed" Steve Jobs, to Apple in 1997 (as though the most unfathomably impossible phenomenon in the history of humankind had occurred), to the careful selection of maliciously undertoned quotations, and quite often blatant slanders about Jobs, the book appears to be a collation of 'hate diaries' maintained by two wannabe authors, whose sole purpose in writing this book seems to be to fuel an anti-Steve sentiment among its readers!  If you happen to be one of those people, who finds some twisted pleasure in those idle conversations that involve scandalmongering [especially Steve Jobs], then this book should provide ample fuel for your negative energy 
 Let the thirteen page Introduction be a warning to anyone who dares venture beyond.  Anyone who reads more the Introduction does so at his or her own peril.  The book is barely readable.  It should be obvious to even a casual reader that this book was cobbled together.  This book does an injustice to the name and legacy of Ralph Ellison 
 She lost me totally, utterly...on the FIRST PAGE. Kirchner describes Vishnu's tent as "a camel's spit away."  A wha? Do wha?  And it turns out that's a high point. By the tenth page, I was in so much pain I had to put it down and never look at it again. Does anyone want to buy mine? I'll do one better! I'll PAY YOU TO TAKE THIS BOOK. It's not worth more than a quarter, though. So if there are no takers, this thing's going in the recycling to become something better in its next life.  Seriously. Worst...book...ever...written. 
 I agree completely with the Becksted review (I also noted that it was helpful, but I meant it would have been helpful had I read it before I bought the CD).  This refers to the CD version.  I did listen all the way to the end, I kept thinking there was going to be something, but continued to be disappointed.      I found the analogizes to be strained beyond usefulness (evaluating someone's integrity by the size and shape of the wake they create... are their people waterskiing on it?)   It seems to be politically incorrect to come out in opposition to "integrity" in this day and age, but frankly this book didn't help me much.   
 "How to Control a Runaway Camel"......"How to Escape a Runaway Parade Balloon"......"How to extinguish a Christmas Tree Fire"....give me a break.  The "Inspirational Heroes" pages are also complete jokes with obvious political messages trumping actual survival stories.  You would do well to investigate "Joshua Piven" and "David Borgenicht" on google to find out what their intent was in writing this piece of garbage 
 This book for some reason includes re-creations of proto-types. How do you recreate a prototype? Sounds like a dumb idea to me. ...I don't know, but I liked the book mostly because of the interesting photos of GI Joes, and the information that it added to what I already know. The parts of the book (like the value guide) which I thought were garbage I just skipped over. There are lots of entertaining photos in the book, and interesting information too. Is it some kind of Collector's Bible for GI Joe? No, I don't think so 
 Thoughful male protagonists?  If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.  Once you get over being thoughtful about that, you will be jerked through a fast-paced predictable plot until you leave the book in an airport for its next victim.  
 If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!! 
 I think the publication of this VERSION of "Valdez Is Coming" is a travesty. The version published by MGM is NOT the original version. It is MISSING over 20 minutes of the original film. AND nowhere can I find a caveat advising potential purchasers of this film concerning this abominable editing. I have previously stated this opinion on the phone. WHY does AMAZON continue to PEDDLE a bastarized version?  Repeat, repeat and re-peat. Isn't there a law against this sort of insidious editing of the work of a performer- Burt Lancaster, in this case? BAD BAD BAD DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY IF YOU WANT THE REAL THIN 
 I was reading this book again the other day and after initially being sucked in, I was vividly reminded of how much I disliked it.  The history is accurate, the writing style is both gripping and crisp. What is it, then? I suppose the characterization really bothers me.  Whether it is Mary Boleyn, Hannah the Fool, Amy Dudley, or the main character (can't remember his name) from Earthly joys, in several different Gregory books I have read, the central character is the Exact. Same. Person. Give them a different name, a different background, but the exact same personality/values/relation to the world and characters around them.  The person is unusually honest, kind-hearted, and guileless amidst a sea of corrupt people who admire him/her. The main character is generous to a fault, cares deeply about either Mary Tudor or Katherine of Aragon (depending upon which of the two is in the book), and looks down upon the antics of Anne Boleyn or Elizabeth Tudor (depending upon which one is in the book). The main character is always recognized by the historical figures as uniquely honest and wonderful in that way only Gregory's protagonists are. The main character does something self-sacrificing and generous and Katherine/Mary (or in Earthly Joys, Cecil) stands in awe or admiration of that other person's naï¿½ve and unique generosity.  That characterization is TIRED. And I think she is capable of more; I wouldn't be so sick of it if she wasn't a good enough writer that I've read four of her books.   For God's sake, Ms. Gregory, you have amazing talent-- take on a new protagonist! Stop inserting the exact same character in every single one of your novels!  In this novel, she wants to have it all ways with Mary Boleyn. Gregory wants her to be a guileless and innocent sweetheart amidst all these corrupt people (guileless to the point of utter stupidity for a Tudor courtier-- questioning why her family would want her to cheat on her husband with the king? Come on! Short of a mental impairment, she would understand at least the basics of the ambitious world she inhabits!) Yet Gregory also wants Mary to be a calculating and clever courtier like all the rest... She just makes Mary clever/wily whenever it suits the plot, and innocent whenever she wants to prove to us how wonderful Mary is. You can't have it both ways.  She wants readers to get an "insight into the psychology" of these people, yet she makes Anne Boleyn a cookie-cutter villain (to the point where her book presents as the truth anti-Anne Boleyn propaganda invented by Boleyn's CONTEMPORARY enemies in the 1500s) and she makes Katherine of Aragon a cookie-cutter saint. If you want psychological realism, give them -depth- or give up the pretense that your own personal likes/dislikes are not coloring your characterization of them.  My complaints aside, I will tell you that I was pretty sucked into it even a second time around... She's a good writer. I plowed through the first half of the book before the characterizations really started to irritate me.   I'd still take this novel any day over the abomination that is "The Virgin's Lover"... Good God, but that one makes me cringe. However, I'd recommend both Gregory's novel "The Queen's Fool" (same protagonist, as always, but a better novel) and the wonderful "Earthly Joys" before this (same protagonist, again, but so many unique things in that book to make up for it!)  So, get "The Other Boleyn Girl" for a quick read, great historical accuracy, a blatant smear job on Anne Boleyn, glorification of Catherine of Aragon, and an annoying glance into the plot-shifting psychology of the exact same character who narrates every other Gregory novel (at least the ones I have read).   But if you want a sublime Tudor era novel, go for Susan Kay's "Legacy" 
 A carjacking case and a missing 4-year-old boy trigger tension in a fictional town of New Jersey. "Freedomland" which is based on Richard Price's book and stars Samuel L. Jackson and Julianne Moore, could have been a gritty thriller with a better hand like Spike Lee (who did "Clockers" based on Price's book). Unfortunately, in spite of its occasionally interesting moments, "Freedomland" falls flat with lack of sure-handed direction.  Julianne Moore plays Brenda whose four-year-old son is missing. Police detective Lorenzo played by Samuel L. Jackson thinks something is wrong with her testimony as to how her boy was kidnapped, but finding the missing child is not easy as the injured mother suffers severely from the shock and her traumatic past. The film also involves several scenes of racially-triggered violence.  Every part of the film is decently made. They are shot with authentic locations, good supports (from Edie Falco, Ron Eldard and William Forsyth) and intense acting from Moore. She is so intense at times that some may think she is overdoing it, but anyway she is credible as tormented mother. Still something is not just right like Brenda's testimony.  [CLUMSY STORYTELLING] So many things are going on at one time. The film at first centers around the mystery of a missing boy, and then it raises a question about the conflict among the Afro-Americans. Instead of developing these ideas, director Joe Roth introduces new topics one after another into the story. As a result the mystery of the kidnapped boy never becomes intriguing. Lorenzo's inner struggle as black detective is not explored enough. You expect surprises from the solutions of the mystery, or cathartic effect after seeing tense acting from the leads. Sorry but you cannot have either of them.  "Freedomland" includes more than one socially relevant issue. Film's "Friends of Kent" is based on the real group "Friends of Jennifer for Missing Children," volunteer group that searches missing persons. Edie Falco's character is based on Donna Cutugno, leader of the group "Friends of Jennifer for Missing Children," who also appears as Elaine in the film. Here "Freedomland" is given a chance to be original, but Joe Roth somehow wastes it with among the jumbled storytelling. The film has excellent ingredients to make a superb thriller, which you don't see in "Freedomland. 
 I'll let it speak for itself: "...unibrows, they go with nonstop thinking... Insomnia may be a problem. Therefore, a unibrow is one physical face trait I recommend changing. Tweeze. Try electrolysis."  "I challenge you. Search any organization. Regardless of job title, social lineage, or pay scale, the ones who work hardest, day in and day out, are the ones with the shortest noses."  "...people with overbites... They're eager, sometimes overeager to please--at least unless they spend years retraining and restraining this impulse through orthodontia."  "Rosetree" is a clever lady 
 this book gives an overview of witchcraft in many forms and how it has been viewed over the centuries by differing religius sects. a long read but good to balance out the positive and negative views of outsiders to the craft 
 In the introduction (pg.6) Ms. Hoppen notes, that after 11 September..."a perfect show house no longer mattered. Having a home that really was a home that really was a home did." So I wonder why all the really gorgeous photographs in this book really do not demostrate that people actually live in these homes. The rooms are devoid of individual personality and really do appear to be perfect show rooms. Personal artifacts are removed from the photographs, replaced with props and items that are fabricated for Ms. Hoppen and for sale on links on her web sites or by the vendors listed in the "Address Book" section of her book (read product placement). With that said there are a worthwhile morsels in this book and the photographs are wonderful, especially if you are looking for interesting and minimal examples of door and window trim, floral arrangement ideas, or you are designing a spiral staircase.  The text portion of the book is very useful for the design process of building a home and the photographs seem to be blue prints come to life, but without any sentimental indications of the lives of the people who might be moving into these homes. The window treatment section should be licenced by Smith and Noble and used in their catelog. 
 This product might do for a backpacking weekend with the Boy Scouts, but compared to a blade razor, or even an electric, it leaves a lot to be desired. I recommend giving it a pass 
 I recently purchased this book, trusting the recommendations on this site, and after reviewing the book I am sorely disappointed. The book doesn't give a tremendous amount of information in individual essential oils, it dedicates nearly three times the amount of pages to Dr. Young's exclusive blends, and how to use them. Additionally a lot of content is dedicated to telling you why every other oil is inferior to the Dr. Young oils, which came across as nothing more than a marketing ploy to sell his oils. I've used other oils, such as John Steele oils - which are EXCELLENT quality - and have had no negative effects from it.  Another thing I found quite alarming is his recommendation to use essential oils neat, including ones known to be irritating or caustic to the skin. The "Raindrop technique" is extensively discussed which any respectable aromatherapist knows is incredibly hazardous and likely to cause burning or injury to the skin.  There is some generally good information given about individual oils, like the range of which chemicals should be in each oil, however, nowhere does he explain what each of these components do, and no where does he talk about how these various components act on the brain chemistry. He also doesn't explain how various oils can counteract each other in the brain chemistry through inhalation, something critical if EO's are to be used in mood alteration, altering brain function or the like.  If you plan on using the Young Living oils, then this book would be of great help, but if you don't, I think the book is mostly advertising for his oil line and won't be of much use to you 
 Once again, a consumer electronics hardware maker proves that they can't develop a good software interface for their device. In terms of physical design, this is one of the best cordless phones out there. The sound quality is also quite good, and the DECT technology works on a band that keeps it free of WiFi interference. However, I had to return this phone right away because the interface is so awful. First of all, Philips really shortchanged this device by putting in a cheap LCD display that can only display 8 letters on caller ID, and then they are letters formed in barely legible block-style on the numerical display. I mean, how much more would if have cost them to put in a modern LCD display with enough pixels to show real letters? But the clincher is the poor design of this phone's Caller ID interface. Call it Caller Confusion. If you have Caller ID with Name service from your phone company, with this phone you can only see the name -- and only the first 8 letters of it! While the phone call is coming in, there is no way to scroll the display to show the phone number. You can only see that AFTER the phone has stopped ringing. What use is that? If the incoming phone call actually has a name from the phone company, this is barely OK, but for the many calls that have no name, this phone will show "CELL PHO" or "UNKNOWN" or "800 SERV". There is no way to get it to show the actual number while the phone is still ringing. If you're trying to screen calls, it's essentially useless. Whoever designed this interface just doesn't get what Caller ID is for in the first place. I would have loved to like this phone, because I think the phones from Panasonic, VTech, Motorola and others are horribly ugly, and my previous Panasonic had the worst audio quality imagnable. But this phone doesn't cut it as well. Why is the cordless phone market so devoid of good products 
 Here's an example of how a book that was perfectly well written and probably well researched was ruined by poor fact checking. For example crediting Brian Eno with using an instrumement that came out in the early 80's vs. his extremely well known use of an instrument that came out in 1969.  I tried to enjoy this book and did for the most part, possibly due to my not catching every flaw. I am tempted to believe that this book was killed by poor editing or fact checking. The type of mistakes are not likely to have been made by an author wh is as experieced and knowlegable as Mr. Kettlewel 
 I also ordered this based on the description of "stainless steel" and was disappointed to receive a chrome-plated product. Worse yet, it doesn't even fit the Char-Broil Universal Rotisserie attachment I have for my grill. 
 Take a step back from your revulsion (a healthy human reaction, so I do hope you were revolted...) to the detailed ritualistic torture of animals and children found in Hard Truth, and analyze the character development and plot development of the last 3 or 4 Anna Pigeon books.  Anna Pigeon as a person is fast becoming a 1-dimensional charicature of the person we met in the first few books; at the same time the author is digging a Natchez Trace of a rut in plot progression - repackaging over again the crazed killer whose insanity is able to drive him through repeated injury to keep after Anna page after page after page. It's as if an editor has said "the stylized nightmare is hot in the industry these days, so rewrite most of the story to be the 'bogeyman' chasing the heroine who just runs and runs and runs."  I can only hope it's an editor saying that, and not a personal problem of the author's.   If one separated the pages of character development from the pages of "insanity-driven bogeyman keeps coming toward Anna" in any recent Nevada Barr book, would there be much more than a short story 
 This item was cancelled by Amazon because of a price mistake that they would not honor after taking my order.very poor customer servic 
 What a rip off!  I bought this book based upon the description here, thinking it was a new book about collage techniques. It turned out it might claim to be a new book, but it's nothing but a reprint and repackaging of Jennifer Atkinson's nearly decade old "Collage Art: A Step-by-Step Guide and Showcase" and the more recent "Collage for the Soul" by Paula Grasdal and Holly Harrison.  It is exactly the same.  Since I already had both of the others, it would have been nice to have been told that, so that I could have saved myself the cost and disappointment of getting this.  I feel duped.  I used to think that Quarry was a half decent craft book publisher, but now I plan to steer clear.  What greed 
 Why was this ever made? Just to make fans of the original mad? Rod Serling is rolling over in his grave. When I originally saw this in Burbank, CA, we were screaming and groaning at the screen 
 This "key hider" wouldn't fool my 18 month old! With a VERY visible seam on the bottom, it's obvious this thing opens. You can practically see the spare key through the cheap plastic! Awful, awful, awful 
 Beware of the Everyman's Library edition of this book (green hardcover, ribbon marker, isbn # 0-679-40564-X). Book V dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted. According to the introduction, this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low. I wish I had known this BEFORE I ordered the book since now I have to buy a different edition in order to read Book V. What a ripoff 
 Two-and-a-half stars.  In Requiem, Faulkner pens a sequel to his sensational novel Sanctuary, attempting to navigate the troubled marriage of Gowan and Temple Stevens. He delves deep into Temple's psyche, revealing a woman unable (or unwilling) to escape her troubled, violent past in Memphis. Just as her marriage is spiralling to destruction, Gowan and Temple's daughter dies at the hands of their nurse, Nancy. Faulkner seems to be trying to lend some serious philosophical weight to the otherwise lightweight Sanctuary. Two problems. First, Sanctuary was fine as it was; a sequel was unnecessary. Second, the narrative structure of Requiem--half prose, half play--while initially intriguing, ultimately hinders Faulkner is his attempt to probe psychological depths. (There's only so much of that you can do when you're limited to dialogue.) Oh, and of course that annoying ubiquitous allknowing lawyer Gavin Stevens has to put his $.02 in. I recommend this book only for true Faulkner lovers 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 I normally wouldn't spend the time to write a review.  This time, I am compelled to warn others not to waste their time.  Beyond Infinity begins as a great idea, and ends with an author so full of his supposed vision, that mere language fails him.  In other words, his images don't come together and the plot explodes.  Trying to find any redeeming value in the last half of his book is extremely difficult.  He creates a world of such strangeness that all "science" is abandoned.  It becomes very much like reading someone doing some serious mind-altering chemicals (e.g. racoon-lke creatures whose intellect spans galaxies - which are all alive and aware - and whose mission to is share their uber-world-view of the pre-eminence of evolution and the failure of the human dream, etc. etc. etc.).  I would quote the book here, but I would probably get slapped with violating some copyright rule.  Please, find another book to spend your time with.  I read a book a week, and I had to struggle to convince myself to not just put it down about once a day and go on to my next book. 
 A pseudo intellectual recommended this for our book club.  Others voted for it because they liked Lolita.  This was the hardest book I have ever had to grind through.  There are sections that are beautifully written but the majority of it dragged on and on.  At the end, I asked myself, "Why do I care?"  I dont think you should 
 This was required reading for my British Literature class. It's the only novel in the class that I struggled with and only struggled from boredom. It is entirely possible that I just do not understand the genius that is Forster, but I did not enjoy this novel. A lover of Forster or Modernist writing might enjoy it more. It must be a classic for a reason. 
 This book has no reality to it. Everything is taken out of context to fit into today.  Sentences were taken out of the verse and used as examples when the whole idea is the entire verse. If we believe as this author has written then the world is doomed and a woman will do it by 2010.  No where in the original verses does it state that a woman with ruin the world 
 I got mine today, and it is being returned today.  I had high hopes, given the reviews so far and the supposed improvement in low light sensitivity.  I was hoping for an all-in-one device for stills and video.  Here's my results:  1) Stills.  Pictures are not too bad, but do not compare with a similar 7MP Canon SD500 which I own.  The zoom works well, focusing is ok, but slow.  The pictures themselves have quite a bit of noticeable noise in them, flash or not, like they are all taken at a high ISO setting on a regular digital cam.  So slight disappointment here.  2) Video.  If this is improved low light sensitivity, I would not have liked to see the results on the HD1!  Video does not even come close to comparing to my regular Sony DV camera.  Focusing is hit or miss, and shake is much more evident at high zoom than with my Sony.  I really was hoping for the be all end all combo device, but the HD2 does neither very well.  Ergonomically it is beautiful and fits in one hand very well.  The finish is great and the buttons are well placed.  But it doesn't justify the price or quality misses on the photos and video themselves 
 This book should be titled " Home-Prepared Dog Diets". 90% of the book was focused on dog diets. The limited amount of information for cat diets was, in my opinion, not substantial or helpful. 
 This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion!  OK, I'm in the minority.  Most of the reviewers LOVED the book.  I think this book is a waste of beautiful words!  Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary.  But, the "story" is "encrusted" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did,  "What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."  You won't feel "alone" in your reaction.  I think "Heart of Darkness" is a much better book.    Comments?   boland7214@aol.  PS:  As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO "yes" votes for my review.  That's "mean".  I'm just giving my honest reaction.  You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone.  Thanks.  
 I like Ludacris. Don't get me wrong.  But this album is kinda annoying.  The blow it out yer ass song is hard to listen to and repetitive.  The splash waterfalls song is also really redudant, if you heard it on the radio as many times as I did, you might agree.  He just talks through too much of this album... instead of rapping.. the beats are kinda weak and repetitive.. there are 3 good songs on this one: Diamonds in the Back, We Got, and Eyebrows Down.  The rest of them are kinda annoying.  But like I said I DO like Luda.. just get red light district or word of mouf instead 
 A Royal Waste of Time is another character sketch on "how to do" Worship.  Although, highly insightful on Corporate Worship, Dawn misses the mark on true Biblical Worship.  She is blur of many authors today who are trying to "fix" Worship instead of doing Worship - just another slant on how to create a corporate worship environment 
 A required textbook for my kid's college class. I have an MBA and am usually interested in anything having to do with business. I thumbed through this very expensive book and gratefully closed it after slogging through a few numbing pages. If you're a business teacher thinking about using it for a class, do the world a favor, put your copy  out of its misery and send it to goodwills. 
 The story of Richard Etheridge is fascinating and inspiring. It is unfortunate that its telling here is tedious and uneven. 
 The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths.   Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL 
 Once again Gary Null "Phd" recycles information into another GN book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements. Gary Null is probably the only author that carries a Phd and fails to reveal where he got his BA, MA and Phd. A quick reading of Quakwatch.com shows that Gary Null has  "nontraditional" credentials and owns a multi-million dollar supplement company. He also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters.   The confusing thing is why someone consuming a nutrient dense diet of organic vegetables, fruit and legumes would need supplements at all. The only reason I could think of is it is a bait and switch technique since most people unable to continue any diet that is restrictive, time consuming and costly give up. So GN conveniently has dozens of vits, supplements, and food replacement products to fill in the gap. I estimate the cost of following GN recommendations in full it would cost about $600 per person a month. To prove my point GN for decades has been against chocolate but recently he has added a GN "healthy" chocolate bar to his portfolio. Gary hooks people in by promising the fountain of youth and eternal life. Interestingly this 60 plus year old finds it necessary to put a old stock photo of himself in his books. 
 Rock has regressed ever since the 80s with nirvana. Green Day's music isn't anything great. Billy Joe can't write lyrics for his life and the music is nothing special. Green Day is another product of a horrible generation of rock. The only genres that are any good are Rap and R&B. 
 I couldn't figure out if this was a novel or a liberal political op-ed piece.  Which is it Mr. Woods?    Two Dollar Bill pretty much follows Woods' imagination of the normal Stone Barrington agenda, with the inclusion of several underwritten and hidden political personal opinions.  Installing political opionions in his books have been common practice for Mr. Woods, I would know because I have read EVERY SINGLE ONE of his novels prior to Two Dollar Bill.    Political opinions are all fair and well...when incorporated into a politically focused novel, which this isn't by any means, but it would be hard to know it by the shear number of snide, unrelated, and personal attacks Woods makes concerning Bush Administation policies and general Conservatives in America.  To his credit, Woods did respond to an e-mail I sent him inquiring as to why he did this, but couldn't provide ANY justification for it.  Merely that it was his right to do so.  And you are correct Mr. Woods, it is your right to do so...just like it was my right to make the conscience decision not to read any more of your books, which I am happy to say that I haven't.  And coming from a person (me) who has ALL of your novels (with the exception of one) in hard back, most of which are signed, is quite a statement to make.  I've been a fan of yours since the early 90's, but cannon continue to be with your recent, and quite obvious, politically motivated agenda.  Good day to you 
 In 428 pages, the book barely moves past control structures. I learned very little from this book and not enough for a functional php/mysql website. Functions are not explained well and very few are included. The author uses old and bad coding practices. As far as the PHP parts go, online tutorials have been more helpful. The title implies that the book is not only about PHP but ALSO largly about MySQL. It only touches on MySQL. This book was useless. I had trouble installing PHP and MySQL despite the book's instructions. The software on the CD is not usable if you want the most recent versions. The coding on the CD did not all work correctly and was incomplete 
 I wish I had done a little research on this book before reading it.  As it turned out when I was near the end of the book it struck me that I wish I hadn't bought or read it.  Undoubtedly the author is a talented writer and an impressive researcher, but the book's almost nonexistant focus on Chaplin as a filmmaker should be a caution to any reader.  Before getting to the bulk of the book I will point out the one positive aspect of the book.  Chaplin's childhood left me in awe.  To say that it was tough doesn't even come close, and I couldn't help thinking how lucky he was to rise from nothing to the succesful filmmaker that he became.  Then there is the rest of the story.    In the +500 pages of 'Tramp,' Joyce Milton concentrates on two aspects of Chaplin's life.  First, the author details the many sad and destructive relationships Chaplin had with his wives, mistresses, and countless others in Hollywood.  Almost no one comes out looking good in any of these relationships - not Chaplin or most of the women.  For about thirty years, until his marriage to Oona O'Neill, it is one tarnished and ruined experience after another.  Paulette Goddard is one of the few who comes out in any positive light.  And of Oona O'Neill, the one woman that Chaplin seemed to be able to have anything resembling a successful relationship, we end up learning the very least.    Second, the author dedicates an excessive amount of space on Chaplin's Marxists views.  The point is clear - it is the highest irony that a multimillionaire actor had such strong opposition to free enterprise.  A lot can be said of that, and Milton takes every opportunity to do so.  The endless cast of insigificant Communist sympathizers goes on and on.  What a boring lot they were!  Eventually I read over these parts with no care to retain any of the information.  In the end it was just plain tiresome.    It was largely surprising how little space Milton spent on Chaplin as a filmmaker.  Many of the chapter titles are Chaplin's own movie titles.  Yet, for example, in the nearly 30-page chapter 'City Lignts,' if you were to string together the few paragraphs that actually deal with the movie 'City Lights' you'd be lucky to put together 2 or 3 pages.  At the end of the book, Milton makes the point that if you want to know Chaplin as a filmmaker, watch his videos, they are readily available.  I second that - rent or buy his videos, skip this book 
 I bought this hoping it would be a thorough historical, architectural and artistic explanation of Chartres, and it really provides very little of such information.  It's mostly an hour of repetitive visual shots accompanied by chants.  Really a waste of money 
 Not sure what I was expecting but it was a let down as far as the movie goes, would not suggest to other to spend the bucks on this one 
 After proclaiming in an earlier book that we are now living in a 'borderless world', Ohmae now writes about the 'end of the nation state'.  Ohmae's work is very popular among geographers who like to use it as an antidote to their own research and perspectives. They claim that national borders still matter and, in general, that space has become more rather than less important. Ohmae has allegedly not understood this. So, I expected Ohmae to argue that the nation state didn't matter any more. But he did not do this. On the contrary, all his examples show that the nation state is still very important. Rather than proving that the nation state does not matter any more, Ohmae shows that people like him can be very frustrated by the actions of nation states. He basically argues that the nation state hinders the market and therefore should be dissolved. He tells us that we should give managers of multinationals all the space and freedom they need so we can benefit from the blessings of the market. Ohmae equates market forces with freedom and prosperity and associates the nation state with repression and corruption. Rather than an economic analysis, his book is a political agenda for right-wing politicians and the managers of TNC's. I think that most people who question the benevolence of the market, will be very irritated by the way Ohmae confuses his own personal interest and the interests of the economic/managerial elite in general with the public interest. I'm one of those people and I can't say that I gained a lot of knowledge from reading this work. Nevertheless, I have to say that Ohmae presents his arguments in a very challenging way. That makes the book interesting in at least one respect, and I guess that people who share his political view will therefore enjoy the book. I didn't enjoy it and I hope that other people will also read between the lines and see that business gurus like Ohmae represent the interests of a small minority (mainly share holders of TNC's) rather than the general interest 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 Annoying.  I lost a lot of respect for Anne Rice with the reading of this book.  It made about as much sense, and meant as much to me as did Inga Muscio's non-fiction drivel.  I love sex - and, I am just a little kinky, too - but this?  This is pulp, this is an attempt to justify cheap porn spewed at the level of utter inhumanity; and considering that said humanity is never established, it is utterly worthless 
 I have worn Rockport size 10 1/2 loafers for many years.  So I had no qualms about ordering them online.   These loafers did not fit and seemed to be at least one size too small.  I returned them and went to the store and bought them - size 10 1/2 
 Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon head up the cast as a comedy duo from the 50's whose careers are ruined by a scandal involving the murder of a young woman. Bacon does a pretty good job as a creepy funny man, with Firth as the anchor of the team. Off-stage the comedy roles they play are echoed in their lives. But I found "Truth" confusing and unengaging. I found it hard to care at all about the demise of the duo. And as several have noted, Lohman as the reporter who seeks to uncover the mystery of the murder is not credible. Give this one a pass 
 I've used several other versions of this product and this seems to be the one that works the best and is the most durable.  The design makes it easy to insert and remove IPOD (unlike the newer versions) and the elasticity of the armband makes it easy to slide on and off one's arm.  I would highly recommend this product.   
 When I try to watch this, I have to turn the sound on my TV all the way up to hear it and even then it's still too low. Some parts are better than others, but I was not pleased with the sound recording quality 
 I remember when Brotherhood Of The Wolf was being released and it looked so good and you know why? Because they show you just the fight scenes but they don't tell you the movie feels like three hours of talking and twenty minutes of action. You try so hard to stick with it but it's just too long and you start to get uninterested. The only person that was holding this film together was Mark Dacascos and they messed that up.   I understand some people might love this movie and I might get bad votes for this review but I really wanted this movie to be good and how am I suppose to deny the fact that this movie goes from good and exciting to boring acting and talking. I saw another reviewer say the movie starts out exciting and then goes overboard and he was absolutely right and if you can sit through this without going to sleep then you have outstanding patience. You could put this movie on and go to the store and come back it the same scene would be on. The acting was ok and what's horrible is Mark Dacascos did the best job and he didn't talk at all.  It's also true that the genre for the film goes all over the place, it's a love story then lust, action, horror, whatever they could think of they put in here and I think that's what mostly contributed to the length and made it boring. It's better to rent this and not buy it because you will be very disappointed 
 Maybe it is me but this novel was about as exciting as watching the grass grow.  It is the first mystery novel that I have read by a female author and I hope that it is not representative of the gender.  But, by the reviews here, all by women, I can see that Jance writes to that crowd.  Her readers seem to like being taken down the aimless boring pass of relationship drible. If you want to spend 10 pages with the main character sitting and talking about nothing in her mothers house or on her friends porch talking about their health than this book is for you.  It is amazing that Jance can start great with the murder scene and then 200 pages later start uncovering her first clue, the insulin bottle.  Jance gives no indication that Oak Vista or the stranded stranger are even remotely related to the story. Do not start this book it is absolutely a total waste of time.  If you want a good mystery read Coben, Crais, Patterson or Michael Connely 
 This set of CD's never arrived. They must have been delivered to the wrong address. So I am disappointed to never have heard them 
 This book is so densely packed with miniscule details and examples that the information's significance becomes blurred, if not obsolete.  The authors show they are very knowledgable on the subject, but they fail to analyze the information they present.  The reader is left to interpret the meaning of details and ponder why they are included.  The authors also use repetitive examples that become tiring and ineffective.  The only minutely important information is presented in the topic sentences of each paragraph, and the book can be reasonably well understood just by reading the introductory sentences.  While this book could be a treasure house for someone researching the relationship between manors and their respective villages, the average reader's attention is never captured.  Students, beware!  Before embarking on an excruciatingly dull explaination of medieval village life, reconsider your other options of reading material. (One option is another book by these authors that has gotten better reveiws. 
 This tool holder is fairly bulky.  I couldn't find the single strong metal ones I was looking for and thought this would be a good substitute.  It doesn't hold out broom or mop (they slide out)so it is now holding two tennis rackets.  Would not purchase again 
 This guy is hyped by DG to gain entracne into Chinese market. Either he does not know the reportoir, or he is faking.  I give minus five, that is -5, for listening experience and -100 for spending money. Stay away from this dude. DG is trying to make money of a bogus guy.  Sound is no good when playing by CSO under outgoing Barenboim is worthless 
 I chose this book for my book club because I had read Erdrich's other novel, The Master Butcher's Singing Club, which was flawed, but still great reading.  I was so disappointed in this novel.  It did not meet my expectations.  I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly.  The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la "Weekend at Bernie's."  Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say. I am less inclined to try her other novels after reading this one.  
 Maybe I was just expecting something like Jaws but I didn't think this movie that great. I watched it twice now only because I kept falling asleep the first time. The script is very weak and thus so is the story, the  acting is flat. Most of the shark sequences are in my opinion taken from  existing documentaries (I have seen photographs of at least one scene), you  can tell that they are cut into the movie and the parts that where done for  the movie are very poorly done. Don't waste your money, if you want to  watch it, rent it, don't buy it 
 It's amazing that NONE of the reviews mention the fact that THE COVER FOR THIS CD IS ACTUALLY FOR "Rose Royce III - Strikes Again" which came out around 1978.  I recognized the cover because I own the album.  I also checked the back cover photo which shows the song names (since no song list was available).  I thought I had finally found the long lost CD for the album I had.  What I received was Rose Royce Greatest Hits Live.  NOT WHAT I WANTED.  HAD TO FILE A CLAIM TO GET MY MONEY BACK, and yet the item is still here being offered for sale.  AMAZING 
 I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of Mexico is severely lacking.  The art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately, it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other Peterson Guides.  Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone.  Howell's is certainly the most complete, but Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field 
 I bought this to upgrade my wireless connection to my Xbox 360. The Wireless connectivity was passable (not great) but what ultimately made me return this was after multiple tests I determined that the router had cut my connection speed to a third of its original speed. I tried to trouble-shoot w/ Linksys Tech Support to no avail 
 My daughter needs to have music playing when she sleeps. That's just a fact because we in a house in the city. This is the weirdest cd I have ever heard. It doesn't really stop her from crying but it does sometimes put her in this weird daze. It does not help her sleep, in fact, it keeps her from sleeping and after a while, she is agitated until I turn it off. I'd say if you don't normally play music for your baby she or she may fall for this. I'd recommend just playing any CD that you currently own on repeat mode during naps. The point of playing music is so that when a baby re-enters the light sleep phase, normal sounds in the home don't startle and awaken her. If you feel that you must buy something specifically for your baby to hear, I recommend Woody Guthrie "Nursery Days" for your baby. It has become the soundtrack of our lives. 
 i've got the first several pearl jam album releases through 'no code'.  this band was just getting worse with every album.  eventually, i caught on and stopped wasting my $.  i read all the great reviews of this album and thought the first single was alright.  who the @$#%@ are these dumb reviewers?  are they getting paybacks?  is this politics or music?  live 105.3 barely played any of this album - and i should have taken a clue from that.  they still know how to play, but need some new energy and ideas to make cohesive, appealing songs.  also, maybe they need to be poor again to lift their spirits - obviously being filthy rich isn't helping!  only put 1 song on my mp3 players...= 1 star 
 In a sense, it's sort of silly to try and write anything useful about a book so completely hyped by critics and carefully studied (cf. New Essays on Call it Sleep), but I'm going to anyway, because I didn't like it. Now, to be totally up front, I read it under a certain amount of duress. My book group picked it, and after the first ten pages I decided I wasn't going to read it and would miss the discussion for the first time in four years. However, it happened that at the exact same time, I started a research project in which I needed to learn about Manhattan in 1916. Since that's just a year or so after when this novel is set, I realized I could kill two birds with one stone -- and so I went ahead and read it.  In hindsight, I realize that I should have skipped the introduction by Alfred Kazin which appears in my edition. It gives away almost every significant plot point and plants far too much in the reader's head -- I cannot conceive of why it wasn't the afterword. Plussing as which, it's not a great essay, even a light skim of it will reveal at least one logical flaw and a total misreading of a scene from the book. So, skip the introduction until after you've read the story. And that story is basically the heavily autobiographical inner life of a emotionally damaged 8-year-old Jewish kid in a rapidly modernizing New York. Many like to laud this book as the best novel about the immigrant experience ever written. This seems rather a strange proposition, for while one of the central themes is certainly the boy's attempt to discover an identity in this brave new world, his circumstance is far from typical. First of all, the Jewish immigrant experience in New York is a very particular one, especially as it relates to cultural persecution in the old world and the notion of alienation and always being "the other". Trying to say the "New York Jewish immigrant experience" is representative of the "immigrant experience" in general is clearly ridiculous. Secondly, by their own choices and actions, the boy's family is almost completely cut off from their fellow immigrants, and are hardly representative. Indeed, it's almost refreshing to find a depiction of immigrants whose hardships are largely of their own making.   The boy protagonist is a particularly irksome guide to this world, as he is the ultimate mama's boy (although not without reason). One of the running menacing subplots is the question of whether or not his father is truly his biological father or not, and what exactly his mother got up to in the old country that led to her being married off to a brute of a man (elements apparently drawn from Roth's own childhood). The bulk of the book concerns the boy's horrendous struggle both to assimilate into the world around him and to decipher the spiritual world. The former is a reasonably well-told and familiar portrait of an outsider who just doesn't "get it". The latter fills the book with religious symbolism, which remained largely a mystery to me owing to my utter lack of religious education and knowledge. Clearly, readers with a strong understanding of Judaism and Christianity will certainly find plenty to chew on. The sexual realm is another running theme, and one that's treated with a great deal of angst, confusion, and negativity. This takes on an entirely different aspect if you read the book knowing that Roth, as his biographer so gently puts it, "indulged in incest" with his sister Rose (and a cousin) for several years during his early teen years. A less sugar-coated way of putting it is that he sexually abused and raped his little sister for several years... This is hardly incidental to the book, as his biographer writes: "Roth would ultimately recognize that incest was the engine that drove his composition." Roth's tortured soul comes through very clearly in his younger alter ego, and it's not a pretty sight.   The style and language used are certainly distinctive, and doubtless many find it invigorating and affecting -- I did not. Roth was rather famously influenced by Joyce, Eliot, and other modernists, and I just happen not to care for modernism. The stream of consciousness employed to depict the boy's inner terrors is effective in moderation, but each passage of it runs on far too long, almost to the point of parody. Similarly, much has been written about Roth's representation of Yiddish and the phonetic treatment of English in the book, but neither has aged particularly well. The stylistic flourishes, epithets, and distinctive syntax of Yiddish which Roth employs are difficult to read without simultaneously "hearing" them as farce or parody of the Mel Brooks variety. There are a great deal of detailed descriptive passages, which again, may appeal to those who appreciate the writer as still-life artist, but again, these struck no chord with me.  So, I freely admit that many of my reasons for not liking the book are personal, however I doubt I am alone in this (as indeed I wasn't in my book group). It simply did not resonate with me on any level, and I can't say I'm the richer for having read it. Others certainly will be though, especially those with an interest in Jewish-American literature or literature about New York 
 I didn't know this sort of 18th and 19th century Travel Literature was still being written today. Tom Miller travels awful far to come home with his suitcase full of frat-boy stereotypes and over determined metaphors. Cubans here are sexy, mango eating, Chevy driving caricatures. Having  traveled there frequently over the last ten years, I can tell you the only  subject illuminated by this book is the inability of Miller's mind to look  past his own North American biases. There are excellent books about Cuba  written by strangers to that country, see Cardenal's for example. There are  also excellent books about Cuba written by Cubans, see for example Franqui.  This book however is not worthy of the trees that died for it 
 When a book that is so provably fictional as CROW KILLER is praised repeatedly for being "true" and "accurate," the review says more about the values and fantasies of the reader than about the book.  CROW KILLER is a vicious racist diatribe that perpetuates a comic book view of the fur trade. Johnson wasn't a "mountain man," he was one of the jackals who drifted in a generation later to pick the bones--a buffalo slaughterer and a wolf killer. And a racist among men who understood the Indians better than most.  Vardis Fisher's MOUNTAIN MAN has a good deal of racism in it, but Fisher manages to maintain a distance between his own values and those of the mountain men. He gives the Indians a chance to tell their own story, and he tempers the cultural racism of the mountain men with their firsthand knowledge of the people around them. JEREMIAH JOHNSON goes even further in that direction, and that, for one thing, is why I consider the Redford/Pollack film the best of the three works.  The Indians in Fisher and Redford's stories are real people with intelligence, courage, and a way of looking at the world that is different from ours but not inferior. In CROW KILLER, Indians are stupid, vicious (and look who's talking), subhuman. Poisoning forty Blackfeet warriors is, you see, a joke. Any REAL (that is to say, "white") man can kill them in handfuls.  Get over it. The mountain men were no more glamorous that Hell's Angels or that vicious little twerp Billy the Kid (Michael Pollard, folks, not Val Kilmer, Kris Kristoferson, or Paul Newman). They went west to get rich, just like the grubby gold-mad prospectors we don't idolize at annual "re-enactments."  They went west because they were too sociopathic to survive in civilized society, and they admired the Indians because they appeared, to the outlaw white, to be a lawless ("adulterous", as Chris Lapp says) people. And libertarians, like Fisher, worship them because they are so utterly self-absorbed, self-important, and "free" of society. And romantic city boys, their drawers damp with admiration, called their manifestation of sociopathy "freedom." Right, like the "freedom" of meth-lab enterpreneurs on their Harley vibrators.  So if you enjoy racist humor and violence, and you love perpetuating stereotypes about Indians, and you want to admire somebody who, if he really were who you think he is, would beat you to a pulp just for fun, go for it. But don't call it history, Ok? It's no more history than HUSTLER is gynecology 
 i purchased this book several years ago and enjoyed it immensely.  and after seeing her on montel williams and hearing her on coast so coast am with art bell, i was completely hooked. what a truly amazing gift she has, right?  i even went as far as booking a reading with her.  the reading came and went. . . and absolutely nothing she said came true.  while the book was a fun read, i learned a rather expensive lesson and will never again waste my money on anything that has to do with sylvia browne.  
 Several weeks have passed, and still waiting for Amazon to ship the book that was listed as in stock and availabl 
 Now Amazon has reviews for the movie that I am reviewing-'North and South Shaolin' and a Jet Li Shaolin Temple movie.  Now I can guarantee you that the 3 Jet Li 'Shaolin Temple' movies are great but this one is kind of a dud.  I don't know why Amazon thinks these are the same movies but they ARE NOT.    Cassanova Wong stars as a young monk who has to take down the majorly underused kung fu superstar Eagle Han.  Sadly Eagle is in Godfrey Ho form and the action director does not know how to use him properly.  Cassanova on the other hand looks superb but does not get in near enough fighting.  While the choreography is average at best, they speed up the film so much we can hardly see what the hell is going on in the fights.    The story is not really worth going over.  Eagle Han(Han Ying) plays your standard government bad guy.    2 things that really stood out to me was the great training sequence with bamboo that Cassanova has and in the final fight you will see a couple of short action scenes that Donnie Yen ripped off for 'Legend of the Wolf'.  Then this movie rips off that sweet kick that Cassanova does in the finale of 'Warriors Two'.  Sadly the final fight is not great but the last 12 minutes are still worth a watch for any kung fu fan.    Picture quality from Video Asia is not very good but it is LETTERBOXED!!! 
 Sure, I had fun reading this book.  But the Amazon reviewer who termed it "highly speculative" is understating the case.  Opinion, conjecture, hearsay, and speculation too often take the place of thorough, solid documentation.  And unlike many other Amazon reviewers, I found McLellan's tone off-putting.  She alternates between patronizing her subjects (the very notion of calling them "my girls," for instance) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader.  Is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant?  You bet.  But is the topic of lesbianism in Hollywood well-served here?  I don't think so 
 Fortunately, it has been a long time since I read anything this sappy, sophomoric and/or senseless.  Frankly, I'm amazed this series was published.  Adriana Trigiani is a harlequin romance writer at best (i.e. fabio visits the farm), and it's unlikely she'll ever produce literature of quality.  I left this book in a Portland coffee shop (on purpose), and it was still there when I returned two weeks later!  Go figure, eh? 
 After reading Deep South and Flashback, I was looking forward to going back and reading some of the earlier Anna Pigeon books. Liberty Falling has to be the worst of the Pigeon series. I found myself skimming over pages and skipping over the last third of the book to get to the end and hope the ending would make it worth the read. It wasn't. 
 I should have known that decorating "Martha-style" would not be my style.  Her passion in finding the "old" at bargain prices and making it "work" for her is not what I call decorating.  She loves to re-furbish, re-store and re-model ... I don't.  However, my expectations were really dashed after completion of the book and realized there was no valid reason for her publisher to classify it as a decorating book.  If you like to read about Martha's homes, her anecdotes and her convoluted names of Martha-labled paint colors, you will enjoy it ... maybe.  I've seen and heard it all before.  
  you can't use this watch opener alone. You need a vise to hold the watch. The gromets that go into the opener that are supposed to fit into the watch back grooves do not stay in. As soon as you turn it over they fall out. I've already lost two of them. It's a poorly made item, and if it woldn't cost about as much to return it as keep it I would return it 
   I was hoping to be able to set up the LCC with this book, but apparently I needed to get the "How to Form an LLC" book (which I'm NOT going to do).    I've read the Nolo California Corporations book and it already covered much of the info here.  What I was looking for was help with writing good articles of organization and operating agreement (specifically for a 1-person LLC).   The operating agreement example he gives is not specific to a one-person firm.  A prudent person might change the language in his example operating agreement to reflect that the LLC is composed of just one person.  Also, the book does not cover the fact that in CA you can specify additional info in the Articles, such as rules for admitting new members.  Awfully light for "All you need to know" 
 Mark Steyn in Broadway Babies Say Goodnight (Musicals Then and Now) has accomplished an unique objective.  He has written a book that is meant to appeal to people whose veiws are strictly politically conservative, love musicals (particulary fond memories of older musicals that they are in fact too young to have even seen) and do not know any actual facts about the history of the genre so the author's glaring mistakes will not prove an annoyance.  Even stranger is that he has found these people and, God bless them, they have the book they have always dreamed about.  For anyone else, this can be a bit of a slog.  It is funny (espcially if you like puns) in places but the arguments are so often backed up with mistakes as to be worthless.  This book is not truly bad.  It is just simply odd.  If you like Mark Steyn (this book is more about him anyway) then enjoy.  Othewise, it is worth a pass 
 The first third of the book has quite a bit of repetition.  Perhaps this was an attempt at establishing greater breadth but it just comes across as loosely structured prose.  Maybe the editor could have taken a cue from Cantor and deleted the middle third of the text in which the author gives a rather watered down version of the proof for incompleteness - thus  failing to live up to the book's subtitle. The final part deals with some of the personalities around Godel at the institute and - having finished with the more technical material - makes for an easier read 
 This is an OK book, but the author's belief in simplistic modern mythologies like global warming and the imminent breakup of western civilization is hackneyed if not downright laughable.  You will get a more profound and fullfilling idea of voluntary simplicity by simply (no pun intended) re-reading Walden.  
 This book is not in the same class as The Ezekiel Option. Much of the writing and plot is contrived,the chapters are short and the empty spaces between them are large. It seems almost as more an effort to make some buck'ola off the Ezekiel books coattails then a real effort to write something with meaning and meat to it. I was bored, bored, bored with the whole shebang. Nuff said adios amigoes 
 The topic is excellent and very interesting from a human, spiritual as well as historical point of view.  However, Connor's writing is so repetitive, slow and chaotic.  He repeats the same ideas and facts over and over again, which makes the reading boring and annoying.  In addition, he presented the story in such a chaotic way.  So there is no time continuity or subject continuity.  Suddenly the reader jumps from one subject to a completely different and uncorrelated one.  Also, historical events are presented in a chaotic way.  Keppler would be mad to see so much chaos in his story!    But what annoyed me the most was the repetitions of facts and ideas.   
 Should you be afraid of your microwave oven? This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, "Have you fed your baby breakfast today?" then you may like this book.   Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one. 
 I was excited to find a canopy for my daughters car seat to get the sun out of her eyes.  The ad said "universal fit".  Well, it fit, but second size up  car seats are taller and kind of lean back.  When you attach the canopy, it doesent pull forward enough to block any sun.  A hat better serves my child then this aparatus.  It now sits in the garage with all the other failed  baby devices 
 Having an advanced degree in Sociology and also having personal relationships with members of Old Order Groups does not make me an unbiased reviewer of this work. As it stands, I believe it takes a very conservative and functional perspective on the dynamic groups of these people and does not even begin to address the integration of change and conflict within these groups in anything ut a very superficial way. A shame, as I was hoping for a more dynamic read than a functionalist perspective of very diverse and dynamic subgroups.  As it stands, I found the work not truly willing or able to explore deviance, social control, conflict or the realism of the daily lives of these peoples as they struggle with their religious lifestyle and the world around them. As stated, it was a descriptive work from a functionalist perspective. Too bad as the subject and persons are far more interesting than the authors would have left one to believe, especially when living among those people in communities and thier true impact on the larger secular society around them as I have seen 
 I honestly do not understand what all the hype is about.  I forced myself to read this book because all I had ever heard was how it was one of the best and most influential pieces of modern literature, but eight hours a day of manual labor would be a less tiresome task then trudging through this pile of rubbish. In all honesty, the plot is entertaining, if you can find it.  I am sure the Cliffs Notes of the LOTR are interesting and entertaining, but why anyone would want to torture themselves reading this collection is beyond me.   I read one chapter a night until I was done, and that was too grueling a task.  I constantly found my mind wondering and having to reread every page because it could not hold my attention.   You don't have to believe the hype.  This collection of books is really, really terrible and boring, and I wouldn't wish the task of reading in on my worst enemy 
 This book is an array of simplistic information based on cognitive therapy.  Instant revelations of one's point of view and correcting it do not a big change in life make, in my opinion.  The writer seems to think so.    I'm also tired of professional writers starting many sentences with "But" when the "but" should be connecting one half of a sentence with another, or the two thoughts should be separate sentences, either of which would work well, rather than repeatedly breaking rules of grammar in this way.  Where are the proofreaders and editors?  
 I bought this book as I was interested in simulating in simprocess. The book is not useful at all neither for an experienced modeller, nor for a beginner. This is of no use for a practical modeller, theoreist or student.  It is more of an entertainment kind of book with very generalistic sporadic examples about where simulation application was successful and funny pictures, double space 16 font text with no content.   For beginners, one should rather buy "Business Process Simulation" by Laguna, which also has a student version of soft. One can go through simulation examples and learn a lot. (I bought this two books together)   In general, if you want to waist your time and money, and read something in half an hour and learn nothing, buy it. But but  does it make sense to pay for nothing and make the authors rich just because they are from GACI or Ernst and Young consultancy. Bad use of their brand to promote the sales of the bad book (but probably not so bad software 
 This is a terrible book.  Having read many of Dumas' other books, I expected a story about a dashing young hero who would fight with the blood thirsty rabble in Paris to rescue the innocent victims of the revolution.  Instead, I found an aimless and unbelievable plot that proceeded to kill off all the heros and heroines in the book.  I was left totally perplexed about why Dumas bothered to write this awful book 
 Riordan has created an interesting and original character in Tres Navarre, and I will trust other reviewers' claims that the local color--an important part of any private eye series--is right on the money; however, I find it difficult to believe that this book and its predecessor, Big Red Tequila, won awards for anything.   The plots, as other reviewers have noted, are suspect at best, fouled by loose ends that never really get resolved.  Many of the secondary characters blur together.  Often Tres's motivation is difficult to fathom.  And the dialogue is the weakest part of the series (if Ralph, Tres's Hispanic sidekick, said "vato" one more time, I was prepared to douse my paperback copy in gasoline and set it afire).  Did this novel really enjoy the attention of a professional editor? I've read much better--how are these "awards" determined, anyway 
 Nicely drawn characters; good writing; different and compelling story. Why don't I like it, then? Because of what the author did with these things. It ends in disaster and proves nothing. Afterwards, I find that this novel lingers in the mind like a bad taste in the mouth. I wish to God I'd never read it 
 I've been a loyal user of Systemworks (also "Utilities" & AntiVirus) for many years, frequently buying upgrades as I moved through various Windows OSs.  The latest verison (2006) has been a big disappointment.  1) The "integrator" repeatedly crashes (and "must shut down").  I was told to reintall (it took 4 hours).  Tech support (email) was slow and barely intelligible.  2) The full scan now takes over 8 hours on a modest sized system.  3) The utilities have not been substantially improved in 5 years  4) The rebate (for upgrade users) came in the form of a debit card, not a check.  (What a hassle!  I don't want any more "plastic"!)  5) Turning the Norton protection off substantially speeds up my PC.  What the heck is going on back there?  During the next year, I'll be looking for a new Anti-Virus support product.  Cheers, Joh 
 I expected this book to be an account of the author's being born again as a Christian.  Unfortunately the book contains very little material on this subject.  Rather it is a pedestrian account of a rather boring boyhood and adolescence.  His only slightly veiled anti-Semitic remarks contribute to a very uncomplimentary self-portrait 
 In a word this movie was disappointing. It's supposed to be about beautiful Spaniards having sex on a magnificent Mediterranean island. Well there wasn't that much sex and the photography was nothing special. Add that to a plodding pace and poor plot and you don't get a very good fil 
 I highly recommend buying this type of booster pack. Nearly every card rocks, even the commons are awesome. If you want to work on a Light-type deck, or just a normal one, you'll lose every time without these. Also, what's everyone's problem? Not long ago, YGO was the most popular thing out there, and now I'm lucky to still be popular because I still like it.  P.S. Buy the Exclusive Pack 
 I was excited to see that Steven King had a new novel out.  I began the book full of anticipation, eager to enter into King's world.  However, as I began to read I became more and more unable to sustain interest in Lisey's world.  I was bored, and I gave up.  Perhaps I will try again some time;  the book is still weighing down the shelf 
 This book might be useful if you've never completed a lyric, or if you think REO Speedwagon are brilliant songwriters. But if you can write at all, this won't help. Save your money, I wish I had.  I even feel bad about giving this to any aspiring songwriter, as it's loaded with bad rhyming habits and silly exercises. Take a pass and just listen to the great songwriters' songs instead 
 I did not like this cd at all.  There was not even one song that I liked.  However, given the positive result the cd received, it may just have been my personal taste.  I also got her new cds, and did not like those eithe 
 This book is one of the most important books I have read in my life-time. It is well researched and should be a text book for highschool Political Science courses in every public school. The author presents a fair, well-written factual account of the buying of the U.S. Government by a very wealthy, very well connected, and very powerful family.   How can we force democracy down the throats of other nations under the sword when we are not a Democracy 
 I have had very bad experiences with this company in the past.  There is absolutely no support for any repair to their products whatsoever.  If there's a problem in the first 90 days, you're fine.  After that, you're up the creek - and this is particularly true of any item with electronics in it.  As all their components are manufactured in Asia, they have no way of repairing or replacing any component of your items should anything go wrong with them in time.  Be very careful with these people, as you're likely to pay a lot of money for a very pretty, non-functioning bookend 
 Buyer beware!! Don't bother buying this. Terrible quality. If you bought one at a local dollar store you would be better off and a lot easier on your wallet. 
 I loved Fly Girl, so when I seen that a new book came out called For The Love of Money based on the same characters only grown up I was thrilled to read it. But once I did, I could not get past several pages, I honestly don't like it. I own the book and never even read it through 
 I really liked her "Nickel and dimed" book, enough so that I bought this one just on the strength of it. I'm sorry to say I was disappointed.  Most of the book is not really about working in corporate America, or being laid off, or even about job-seraching. Most of the book is about *preparing* to job search - and going about it pretty badly.  More than 50% of the book relates the author's experience with a series of Carreer coaches, resume polishers, etc.  who were selected seemingly at random, and who run the gamut from out-and-out charlatans to useless incompetents with no discernible qualifications. What's more, this is typically clear immediately, but the author sticks with them for a long time - and tells us in details about it.  Another point is that she is looking for most of the book for a Director or even VP level job, while her resume has basically zero previous same-type jobs. Her resume DOES show she has the subject-matter skill (as a consultant), but these are Management/executive positions. To get one, you have to have relevant experience in running a similar but smaller team, doing a similar job in a smaller organization, or at least working in such a team and showing you deserve a promotion. So, from the start the author has made the chance of getting a job, or even an interview, very small, by seeming to be very basically not qualified, regradless of subject-matter experience.   Another large piece of the book, and a constant theme is that job searching is mostly a matter of "networking". This is implemented mostly in the form of meeting other unemployed people, who also are either going to the same (useless) carreer coaches/resume rewriters etc. In rare instances, "networking" is taken to be brief meetings with total strangers and being able to get them to take your card, or your resume, and maybe hear your 30-second self-description (The "elevator pitch").  Common sense shows this is a waste of time. "networking" can get you a job opening when a person knows you enough to recommend you to an opening he knows about. But a stranger? why would he recommend you, and what will  the recommendation be like? "Here's the card of someone I have met yesterday for 5 minutes. I know nothing about her, but she says she is good. I think we should make her our next VP" - Come on.  yes, in many corporations the best candidate is brought in by personal recommendation of an insider. This assume the "insider" knows the candidate enough to recommend them, and that the insider has enough standing in the organization for the recommendation to be an advantage.  So - by all means networking is good - but only with people who already know you, and are in some position of influence. Meeting total strangers, espcially ones also unemployed, and even more especially ones who pay the obvious charlatans for Career/job-search advice is probabaly not going to cut it.   I respect the author's intelligence enough to assume she knows this, or realized it after a short while - so why go on, and on, and on, doing it and describing it?  Finally, when she does get to send her resume and even talk (during job-fairs) to corporate people, the approach she describes is to figure out something the company is doing wrong (in her opinion), tell the recruiter about it, and claim she can help. For one thing, the people she is meting are HR recruiters, and usualy junior ones. They are not in a position to hire company-fixing-level people, even if they agreed the company needs fixing. They have a specific job with some job-description,and are looking to find someone who can do THAT, and preferably one with demonstratable experience in doing the same exact thing in a very similar setting very recently. Everything out of this track is noise - and rightly so.   But more seriously, I am amazed this sounds reasonable to the author, or indeed to anyone. let's see: if I walked up to the author during some book signing tour, handed her my card ("networking, networking"), cited the review elswhere on this page that faults her writing style and told her I can help her fix that, if she just hires me, whow likely am I to get a job?   I'd rate the book lower, but the last two chapters are good in my opinion. Worth the read - but wait for the paperback, by a used one, or go to the library. 
 I am a French myself, I've noticed that there are a lot of books to teach people out there "how to be French", "how to eat like French", "why French are so great", for me, it is very strange. Of course France is a great place with all those history, food, museums, culture. But we also have a lot of bad things. So prasing French all the time is a bit non sense and it really makes us French more arrogant. (Yes, we are too arrogant and proud of ourselves). Even being a French myself, I have to admit it. We should learn to respect other culture and people. But all these books are making us feel like privilage. There is another book called" French women don't get fat". To be honest, we have a lot of fat people in Paris, a lot of women out there are not slim or as elegant as the books described. These books making the girls here feel like they are godness, which is bad. More and more people here are thinking they are the best. But the fact is, we have high unemployment rate, our streets, metros are so dirty, our people don't want to face the reality. We love to enjoy life too much, but we are too lazy to earn money to support ourselves and we are rejecting other culture. So wake up, we are all equal. Don't let our surface fool you. 
 This is a lovely book until you get to the part that tells the child what negatives to expect and that the parent will always be there to help with negatives. It's enough with the targeted age group just to say, as the book does in the beginning, that you and God are there to guide and love him or her. But laying the ground to expect bad grades and mean teachers (just one example) is not productive. And saying that you will "always be on the child's side" sets the child up to believe that you don't think he or she will ever make a mistake or be wrong or deserve punishment or correction from you! Better just to say that you will be there to help. I was disappointed because this book has some very nice parts, but I would not read it to my grandchildren. Life is hard enough without setting them up to fail. Two thumbs down on this one. Good Night God is a much better book 
 Gary B. Nash's purpose for the book is, "to capture the revolutionary involvement of all the component parts of some three million wildly varying people living east of the Mississippi River." (Nash, xxviii)  Nash bemoans how the "great men" still "dominate the master narrative [of the American Revolution,]" (Nash, xv) and that we are struck with "historical amnesia," (Nash, xvi) because we forgot the stories of those outside of the "great men" clique.  He states that we cannot capture the essence of the Revolution without paying close attention to the experiences of the many groups that made up colonial society.  These groups not only include the poor farmers, artisans, and other laborers, but also of women, blacks (both free and slave), and of the AmerIndian population.    Nash illustrated the problems and plights of the lower order through their myriad of stories.  To illustrate the importance of the lower classes of white society, he showed the importance of these individuals in their role as revolutionaries, which include their participation in riots against the various taxes implemented by the Parliament.  He also shows the tensions between the seaboard inhabitants and their piedmont antithesis to the west which, in his estimation, helped to spur change all along the way.  In the case of the inhabitants of what would become Vermont, he illuminated their fight against the landowners located primarily in New York City.  Led by Ethan Allen, the "Green Mountain Boys," as they would become known as, fought to keep the land that they cultivated with their own hands - against the wishes and land deeds that the New York City landowners had for their property.  (Nash, 110 - 114)  He also showed how the piedmont inhabitants of the Carolinas had to struggle for their rights to live life as they saw fit as well.  (Nash, 73 - 79)  In the case of the "Green Mountain Boys," their struggle proved to be more successful than the struggle of the Carolina piedmont, whose insurrection was brutally suppressed by then colonial governor of North Carolina, William Tryon.  Nash also shows how this sector of the population became mobilized politically during the course of the revolution.  In Nash's estimation, these people were spurred on by the rhetoric of equality in society, as championed by the Founding Fathers in the countless tracts and pamphlets that were produced during the revolutionary war era.  In Pennsylvania, the 1776 state constitution was heralded by Nash as a true revolutionary document because of its unicameral legislature, its weak executive, and its attempt to limit an amassing of wealth within the state.  He also praised the fact that artisans and lower sorts also played such a vital role in the forming of the new state constitution.  (Nash, 271 - 286)  In states where the constitution did adhere to these premises, Nash equated it with a betrayal of the will of the people, as evident by the problems Massachusetts had in ratifying their state constitution because of its more conservative outlook.  (Nash, 302 - 304)  The talk of freedom and equality also spread, according to Nash, to the black population in the American colonies.  These ideals not only spread to the free black portion of the population, but also to the thousands of enslaved blacks throughout the land.  This spread of ideas to the black population, particularly the enslaved portion, troubled white leaders, according to Nash (Nash, 59)  What was more troubling to the white slave owners was their perception that slave restlessness and even revolt was on the rise.  (Nash, 37 - 39)  What else was truly troubling to many slave holders was that the British actively recruited the slaves to fight against their masters - and all other rebels to the British Crown.  (Nash, 157 - 164)  Nash contributed much of the awareness of the enslaved to their plight the rise rising literature of freedom that the Founding Fathers were disseminating across the land.  Nash believes that this rhetoric, and its implications, were inescapable to the slaves.  (Nash, 64)  He also showed us the aftermath of the revolution for those slaves who sided with the British; they were transported off either to Nova Scotia or to the Caribbean Islands where they were subjected to an even harsher form of slavery than on the mainland.  (Nash, 426 - 427)   Women also were praised in this work, as Nash pointed out how crucial this sector of the population was throughout the course of the conflict.  First, women were important to execute the boycotts that were prevalent in the preceding years of the revolution.  Nash argued that without their co-operation in the boycotts, the measures would not have proved effective.  This is because women had a great deal of involvement in the running of the household and much of the purchasing power was in their hands.  If they did not adhere to the boycotts, the measure would have failed, in Nash's estimation.  (Nash, 141 - 144)  Nash also illustrated how the women of the revolution became active during the war, specifically in response to rising prices for necessities.  Nash showed us the response of many women in the Boston area to Thomas Boylston, a merchant whose prices on goods rose as the war progressed.  In response to these rising prices, women marched on Boylston's shop, and the shops of other merchants throughout the colonies, to procure the basic necessities for their families at what they deemed equitable prices.  (Nash, 232 - 235)  The plight of the American Indians was also great as land speculators and land hungry colonists swarmed over the Appalachian Mountain range to claim and settle upon lands that were seen as belonging to various Indian nations.  Nash showed us how the natives resisted this encroachment upon their lands through a myriad of tactics, from essentially engaging in bushwhacking warfare with the colonists who encroached upon their lands, (Nash, 253 - 255) to the fact that many Indian nations chose to align themselves with the British in their cause to suppress the rebellion.  (Nash, 151 - 157)  What was more alarming to Nash is the colonists' "genocidal" policies towards the native population.  (Nash, 377 - 381)  Although it may not seem like it, there is an underlying premise to Nash's illustrations in the struggles of all of the aforementioned groups during the American Revolution.  That premise with Nash, at first alluded to, and then by the end of the book, states bluntly is class warfare.  There is, however, a very real problem in this Marxist outlook on American society during the era of the Revolution, specifically that the colonists did not view the class structure in the same light that we do today, or even as class was viewed in when Karl Marx wrote his tracts on such matters.  As Gordon Wood pointed out in his work, The Radicalism of the American Revolution, "The social distinctions and economic deprivations that we today think of as the consequence of class divisions, business exploitation, or various isms - capitalism, racism, etc. - were in the eighteenth century usually thought to be caused by the abuses of government."  (Wood, 5)  Wood also pointed out that there were complexities and variations to American society, which fell along "local, regional, sectional, ethnic and class differences."  These complexities made, "any generalization about Americans as a whole," quite difficult.  (Wood, 6)  Wood further illuminated the difficulties of following such a class distinction as Nash proposed in his work.  Wood stated in his review on Nash's work in the "New Republic Online": Nash's evidence for popular resistance to all this class exploitation is the incidents of rural rioting and urban mobbing that took place in the decade or so leading up to the Revolution.  This mobbing and rioting is exceedingly familiar to historians, who have produced a literature about it.  Unfortunately, these phenomena do not support Nash's argument.  Not only did the rural rioting have little or nothing to do with the Revolution, but the urban mobs, which were indeed directed at British authority, did not represent the class upheaval that Nash assumes.  The rural riots all arose out of peculiar local circumstances, and were hardly expressions of some sort of coherent class warfare.  (Wood, "New Republic Online Review)   Wood, in his review of Nash's work, went on to illustrate exactly what constituted the true dividing lines in American society when he stated: But what of all the rhetoric about the laboring people contesting the aristocratic few that Nash draws on to make his case for class warfare?  There was indeed a serious division in eighteenth-century American society that reverberated through the northern states over the succeeding decades, but it was not the one that Nash describes.  Instead of being divided between a rich upper class and a poor working class, as Nash sees it, anachronistically anticipating a later nineteenth-century division between employers and employees, eighteenth-century American society was in fact still divided between a leisured gentry and the mass of artisans and other laborers who worked with their hands--many of them the businessmen of the future.   In Nash's work, he viewed many of the Revolutionaries as having ulterior motives for their proclamations of equality and freedom.  Nash, I would argue, hinted toward the idea that the Founding Fathers only took part in the revolutionary movement to benefit themselves.  Throughout the course of the book, Nash takes great care to "expose" the double standards of the Founding Fathers, making them seem as if they merely wanted to continue their "elitists" lifestyle at the expense of the commoners below.  There is no bigger whipping boy for Nash than John Adams, who, according to Nash, was essentially a closeted monarchist who was afraid of the people.  To be sure, Adams did have his reservations about the people, but it was more a fear of a "tyranny of the masses" than it was an outright fear that the people would displace the leaders of the new nation.  However, what is truly ironic is that Nash relied so heavily upon the writings of John Adams to illustrate many of his points.  Not only did he rely on Adams' writings, but also the writings of many of the other Founding Fathers.  Throughout the course of the book, when Nash referred to any of the writings of the Founding Fathers, I found myself wondering if Nash was cropping their words to support his case.  It is my belief that this is something that seriously needs to be explored in greater depth than I can provide here.  What is also ironic is that Nash makes little use of the narratives of those whose stories he claimed he wanted to tell.  Outside of the use of Joseph Plumb Martin's narrative of his experiences as a soldier in the Continental Army during the war and the autobiography of Ethan Allen, he does not make extensive use of the diaries and letters of many people who lived through the war experience, both in the military and in the civilian sector.  To be sure, there are many diaries out there from those below who can illuminate their thoughts throughout the era.  Would their writings bear out what Nash proposed?  Nash criticized the Continental Congress for not being able to pay the soldiers their salaries.  This inability to pay the soldiers wages stemmed from the fact that the government was essentially broke: they were unable to levy taxes on the people of the colonies because of the weak governmental structure from which they operated and many of the colonies did not pay their fair share of the financial burden of the revolution.  When Robert Morris tried to restore fiscal responsibility to the war effort and raise revenue to provide pay and necessities to the army, Nash viewed it as an attempt to "tame the social and political radicalism of the Revolution."  (Nash, 367)  However, I suppose Nash chose to forget the fact that Morris was trying to get revenue to provide for the war effort.  Why then would Thomas Paine, one who Nash seemed to have great respect for his principles of democracy, agreed to author a pamphlet on behalf of Robert Morris in favor of his new fiscal plan.  (Nash, 395)  If Morris' plan was so stifling to democracy, intended to roll back the radicalism of the revolution, then why would Paine agree to be a party to it?  Not all of these explanations and questions would mesh well with Nash's outlook on Morris and the Founding Fathers at large.  Further, if the Founding Fathers truly wanted rule for themselves, there was no better chance for one of them to establish it than with the "Newburgh Conspiracy."  It is true that the soldiers and officers of George Washington's army were deeply distraught by the ineffectual abilities of the Congress to pay wages and provide for basic necessities.  (Nash, 370 - 371)  However, what Nash failed to mention is the other half of the conspiracy.  The men wanted to march on the Continental Congress and put George Washington in power.  Washington, through an impassioned speech and performance, quelled all of these thoughts and possibly saved the revolution once again.  Nash, as stated previously, believed the struggle of the thousands of black slaves in the colonies was heightened by the revolutionary rhetoric that littered the landscape of the era.  He believed that such literature raised their awareness and caused more unrest and rebellion than at any time previously.  However, I would like to offer my own take on this.  Did it take pamphlets from the Founding Fathers to raise the awareness of the enslaved that there was something unnatural about their situation?  I certainly think not.  Frederick Douglass' autobiography indicates that from a very early age, he was well aware that there was something wrong with the situation he found himself.  In an illustration, a still teenage Douglass talked with some of his young white friends on the streets of Baltimore and they complained about their lot in life.  Douglass illustrated the point when he wrote, "You will be free as soon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life!"  (Douglass, 53)  While Douglass certainly is an exceptional individual, I doubt that this same premise was lost on the countless enslaved individuals in the colonies and that they wanted freedom and it did not take pamphlets for that realization to come to mind.  Nash lamented the "genocidal policies" towards the AmerIndians adopted by many colonists during the revolution.  While it is true that atrocities were committed against the natives, first, this was nothing new by this point in American history.  Warfare between the natives and colonists was an almost constant from the time that European settlers stepped onto the New World.  In such a climate, atrocities committed by both sides in this armed and almost perpetual struggle were inevitable.  However, Nash is somewhat disingenuous when he makes the native population seemingly innocent or justified in their actions.  Although Nash admitted that the British courted and armed the native peoples to fight the colonists, even after the revolution was over, he cannot seem to find any justification for the colonists to meet force with force.     Lastly, as stated previously, Nash bemoaned how historians and the people at large have lost the viewpoint of those below the Founding Fathers - how the great men still consistently dominant the narrative on the American Revolution.  (Nash, xv)  First, I would ask Mr. Nash, "should we discount what the `great men' did during the war?"  While historians do deal with the "great men" of the American Revolution, I doubt there is one serious historian out there who would discount the actions and sacrifices that were made by the people below.  Their deeds do not go unnoticed in narratives of the war.  We read about the Boston Tea Party, we read about the non-importation of British goods and how the participation of the common people was vital to such an enterprise.  We read about the plight of the Continental soldier as they nearly starve and free to death in the service of their country.    What Nash further discounted was the explosion over the past decades in dealing with various social aspects of the history of the revolution.  Bruce Chadwick's piece, The First American Army: The Soldiers of the American Revolution, he offered the reader a look into the world of the solider in the Continental Army through their diaries, letters and records.  Through these written records, we are presented with the bleak situation that so many found themselves in - conflicting interests between home and duty, the want of food and clothing, and their battle experiences.  Alfred Young, in The Shoemaker and the Tea Party, offers a glimpse into the world of the common man on the streets, taking part in demonstrations and actions against the British and their oppressive measures.  Women's roles in the revolution are far from ignored.  Mary Beth Norton authored a book, Liberty's Daughter's: The Revolutionary Experience of Women: 1750 -1800, dealing specifically with the trials and tribulations of the women during the American Revolution, both from the Patriot side and the Loyalist side.  Linda Kerber also wrote a piece on women in the American Revolution entitled, Women of the Republic: Intellect and Ideology in Revolutionary America, which also draws upon the revolutionary experience of women through their diaries, letters and legal papers.  The Native Americans receive their fair share of print as well.  Alan Taylor wrote Divided Ground: Indians, Settlers, and the Northern Borderland of the American Revolution, which offers a rich, sprawling history focusing on the Iroquois Six Nations of New York and Upper Canada during the era of the American Revolution.  Taylor examines Indians' wise but unsuccessful attempts to hold onto their land as colonists encroached on it.  Colin Calloway, in his work, The American Revolution in Indian Country: Crisis and Diversity in Native American Communities, explored the internal strife that the revolution brought to Indian nations involved with the American Revolution.  The African-American population in the revolutionary era also received a fair amount of print about their ordeals.  Glenn Knoblock wrote, Strong and Brave Fellows: New Hampshire's Black Soldiers and Sailors of the American Revolution: 1775 - 1784, which explored the military careers of over 200 black military officers during the American Revolution and attempted to reconstruct their ordeal throughout the conflict.  Sylvia Frey, in her book, Water from a Rock: Black Resistance in a Revolutionary Age, explored the triangular relationship between the British, the Americans, and slaves in the South.  Through this triangular relationship, Frey attempted to illustrate the complex and confusing options presented to the slaves in the South during the rebellion.  Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic, edited by Jeffrey Palsey offers readers an alternative reading in the same light that Nash presents, the conflicting desires of the myriad of peoples during the American Revolution.  The political historians contained in this work showed that the early history of the United States was not just the product of a few "Founding Fathers," but was also marked by widespread and passionate popular involvement; print media more politically potent than that of later eras; and political conflicts and influences that crossed lines of race, gender, and class.  Thus, this work is not beholden to one particular point of view on the revolution, as Nash is guilty of being caught up in.  These are just some of the books out there on the myriad of topics that Nash covered and, to be sure, there are many more.  These books are not hard to find.  Just do a search on Amazon's or Barnes and Noble's online stores on any of these topics and you will be presented with a cornucopia of choices - there is not quite the neglect that Nash claimed in these fields.  To be sure, there will still be authors who write biographies on the "great men" of the American Revolution, but there are many who also explore the social history of the conflict.  Thus, Nash is not the lone voice for these "forgotten" as he claimed 
 Whatever you do, do NOT buy this film. This is not Drunken Master 1 or 2. As a matter of fact Jackie Chan isn't even the star.(he's only in about 5 minutes of the movie.And, that's a clip from another movie!)The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because the film has mediocore action 
 I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.  Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.  This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels."  It's unfortunate.  There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 I bought this book to help me build my own web page.  I learned how to follow their directions to build a fictional webpage.  When it came time to build my own, however, I was at a loss.  The exercises were easy to follow, but if your information or needs are different this book is really not of much help.  I do have a nice website for their fictional company... now I need to purchase another book to build a website for my own 
 Likely discontinued because I bought this on sale at Frys for only $4.99. It was worth that price.  Like the other reviewer said it dominates the electrical receptacle. Even a four plugger becomes hard to use. Radio sounds very tinny, but works OK. It picks up the local AM stations. I have it on the wall in a workshop where the nicely lit digital clock comes in handy. One problem I noticed was that there is a loud hum when I played the radio while it was plugged in (nothing else active on the line). I got around this by clipping a thin ground wire to the outside antenna. This seemed to also boost AM reception 
 I don't remember where I saw it, but I caught a reference to this book, 334 : A Novel by Thomas M. Disch.  It sounded interesting...  A futuristic look at life in this particular government-controlled housing unit.  After finishing it, all I can say is "why?"...  The book is a series of vignettes that follow a group of people who live in this government housing complex.  It's sometime around 2020 to 2025, and the stories jump back and forth over that timeframe.  The best I can do is describe this as "reality novel-reading" (as opposed to reality television), and I don't like either, I guess.  The stories were pointless, the writing attempted to be philosophical and deep (and it was totally wasted on me), and I never really got caught up in any of the characters or in what was going on.  It sort of reminded me of the movie Pulp Fiction in the way that the timeline of events was completely out of sequence with what you were seeing.  The end of the movie is the start of the movie from a different angle...  That sort of strange stuff.    Perhaps I'm just not "sophisticated" enough for this book, but in my opinion it was a waste of time and paper...  The only thing it had going for it was that it was fairly short.. 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 Ok, so I figured that a book called "Secrets of Halo 2" might be cool, and show me some secrets that I haven't found yet (there are a lot out there). Instead what I got was this piece of ....  First off, out of the whole book, only about 6 pages are actually about Halo 2, and those are just a walkthrough of campaign.  The rest of the book contains a history of first person shooters, and, get this, hints and cheats for OTHER games.  If I wanted to know about Half Life 2, I would have bought a book on Half Life 2. Oh, and for those really old school fans, there's a quick walkthrough of Halo as well.  Even if I knew what this book was going to be, I would say avoid it.  It has more crappy screenshots, and over used strategies (example: Remember that you can duel wield in Halo 2), then you can shake a stick at.  Avoid buying this book.  Save your money for Halo 3 
 EZ girls' score is profoundly awful.   The music from the first season was amazing and it introduced me to a lot of great new artists (Kinnie Starr and Fiest are among the best). So what happened? Where did all the talent go? The music has become laughable... The saving grace from the second season is the commentary on the "lez boat" episode that was done by the actresses who play Shane, Dana and Alice.   During the theme song, Leisha sings "laughing, crying, breathing, f**king, make this song stop really sucking."   Ilene Chaiken and Betty should really listen to her.   When the actors are tearing apart the music, you know it's gotta be bad... 
 when this movie starts it is so dark you can't even see anything. The only way you can know what is going on it to read what Amazon tells you.   After that it is just stupid. 
 A child wants to tell his father he loves him, and the father turns the exchange into a cruel game of one-upmanship.  The child tries and tries until he collapses, exhausted - and still the father won't accept the heartfelt message and chooses to outdo his tiny child and have the last word. That this book is popular and well received is disturbing to me.  The illustrations are very nice - and I'm hoping that this is the attraction people feel, since the message borders on psychological abuse 
 I bought two of these bags so far. both have failed at the plastic fastener, one arm just snapped in no time. the bag itself is ok, but the plastic parts on the belt are really cheap... I wont buy a third one. 
 Samuel L. Jackson seemed somewhat tame in this movie, yet still believable as a coach of a high school in a rough neighborhood. I thought it could have been a little shorter but the time but it's only 76 minutes. That's pretty short. If it was 90 to 120 minutes I guess I would have been as restless as a 6 year old at church. It's kind of dull. 
 I committed myself to reading all of the Caudill nominees for 2006, but broke that promise to myself on this book.  I thought the whole premise was preposterous (why would great-ancestor Smith waste so much time and money building these treasure houses?), and none of the mysteries held the slightest bit of suspense for me.  I trudged my way to the half-way point, then just started skimming until I got to the end.  For all that buildup, I thought the ending was really hokey and dumb anyway.  I hate giving such a negative review, but I found nothing redeeming in this book 
 Mr. Bennett shows a sad, vindictive streak in this book, which I had not expected from him.  He acts as if the whole point of politics is to win debates, using whatever vitriol necessary to score points, with no regard  for civility or morality.  It is nice to see that for all his  liberal-bashing in this text, he found better ground in the future, for in  his book on virtues he explicitly makes the point that good, moral people  can be liberals or conservatives.   If you can ignore the rampant hatred,  he makes some decent points.  The section on drug policy is a great read,  much nicer than his assault on teacher unions when he supposedly is writing  about education.    I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone, though  it has some positive features.  There are more open-minded and insightful  political writers out there, like Michael Lind, Richard John Neuhaus or Jim  Wallis.  Let's not confine ourselves to the angry complaints of a bureacrat  like Bennett 
 This toy looks great in the ad but it took us 2 hours to blow  the dozen or so chambers up.  The instructions were terrible.  You have to force too much air into one chamber so that it will go into the next.  The chambers do not stay inflated and some don't work at all.  My son does still have fun with it but I wouldn't buy it again 
 If you're a "member of the choir" and enjoy righteous indignation this book is for you. A well documented compendium of violations, abuses and near-abuses perpetrated by the right during the run-up to the 2004 presidential election. It contains some important information. You'll read both about evidence of widespread ballot tampering and the expulsion of democrats from Bush campaign events (shocked, SHOCKED!), all presented with the same seriousness. There is litte of importance here that has not been reported elsewhere so if you have been paying attention to the media (beyond the "mainstream" sources) this book will be a re-hash. If you are an Independent concerned about the integrity of our electoral system pass this one by 
 This is the first Patterson novel I have ever read, and it is certain to be the last.  Most good authors draw the reader into a story by offering vivid descriptions and in-depth characters, but Patterson does none of that.  The author's writing style is akin to that of a small child's, as he uncermoniously plunks the reader in the middle of boring locales populated with one-dimensional characters.  Patterson then holds the reader's hand as he matter-of-factly recounts the explosion or gunshot du jour and then moves on without explanation, presenting a book written by a Ralph Wiggums-like child for immature children to enjoy.  How does the reader know Alex was scared? The reader knows because Patterson clumsily beats him about the head and shoulders with writing similar to the style: "The man pulled out a gun, Alex was scared, Alex shot the man and he was happy, and the man was dead."  Don't believe me? Simply graze through the book and find where the hero handily dispatches an arch-nemesis in a scene so brief and without fanfare I had to read it twice to make sure the protagonist killed who I thought he killed, or skip to the end if you prefer and painstakingly wind your way through a series of forgettable characters each deadpanning that he or she is responsible for the antagonist's evil deeds.  Quite simply, this author shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity and this book should be avoided at all costs 
 I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire. When packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space. I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there.  I move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and Blue Smoke is going into storage. That will leave room in the suitecase for her next book... A JD Robb I believe. I was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as I did 
 Most of the time I love French films. 400 Blows, Breathless, etc. This one caught my eye so I bought it. Waste of $$. Horrible. I never did really get the plot becuase there was not much of one. It was just like a homemade movie with really bad sound. I looked around the room and the other two people watching it with me had fallen asleep. 
 True, I do have to read part 7 still, but part 5 & 6 were very poorly done in my opinion.  First of all, it's obvious that the reason for the failure in 5 and 6 is that the gunslingers have lost their edge.  They have become parodies of themselves.  In another review I saw the phrase, "overly mannered," which I feel hits home.  The redundant vernacular: palaver, deal in lead, come commala this, come commala that, come commala with a wiffle ball bat, so... King is fastidious with his overdone jargon that sounds sickenly hackneyed.  Since when did gunslingers become such wimps?  Since part 5 & 6.  That's when.  The repetitive symbolism gets overdone until anything having to do with a 19, dinn, or Ka, is just charred nuggets.  The symbolism has lost its zest by being referred to annoyingly countless times.  As another reader stated, I can't wait to finish the Tower Series, so I can feel some closure on a story that went sour.             
 Domino has to be one of the DUMBEST films to come out in 2005. The lapdance scene alone was so ridiculously stupid to the point where you're laughing out loud. After the first 30 minutes I watched the rest of it in 2x fas forward mode. Didn't iss a thing. Asinine 
 About three years ago, maybe four, I bought two Lexar CFII cards. One never worked, the other worked, but lost all data. I wrote to Lexar, that I had two bad cards, they sent me one new card of the same size. I gave that to my girlfriend & told her to only use it on pix she didn't care about losing. I still have my card, in a ziplock. None of the file removal programs will get the images off, & I've used all of them, & had their (file removal) tech help give up.  In this day & age of "just make the item" I am upset. But you take your chances. Do you want the only picture of your great grand-mother lost because you used a Lexar? I wouldn't, I use an actual sandisk card, myself.  If they ever (Lexar) made it right, I may have written a better review, but they haven't. So that tells me that they don't care.  How important are your pictures to you?   Frederic 
 I read through the 700 pages of this book, including the mathematics, hoping at some point that the Nobel Prize-winning Sen would have something to say about Rationality and Freedom. Alas! I was disappointed. About 500 pages are devoted to an almost entirely vacuous "social choice theory" and in particular Kenneth Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. I was thinking maybe that Sen was doing a "reductio ad absurdum" and at the end, he would offer an alternative approach. Unfortunately not. The salaries of the thousands of academics who are paid to do this stuff should be collected and distributed to poor people in developing countries. A far better use of the money 
 Micheal Dell comes off as a self promoting marketing blow hard and it is not worth the read.  [... 
 I love his music but this cd is extremely poor quality.  It has a lot of background static.  If you want to hear how he interpreted his music, buy it but you will be disappointed. 
 I was disappointed in the recipes in this cookbook. Perhaps they taste wonderful, but if I am just going to go to the store and buy lactose-free milk to replace the milk I used to use (which was free since it came from  our own animals) do I really need a cookbook to tell me how to use it? I  would think I can simply substitute lactose-free milk in the recipes I use  now. That was not my goal in buying a lactose-free cookbook. I was hoping  to find something that would show me how to get along without milk. I'm  sure it fills a need for some, but not for those of us who are unwilling to  go out and buy a substitute product 
 After reading reviews and listening to samples, I bought the cd.  Have to say, very disappointed.  I'm a big fan of Delerium, Zero 7, Cafe del Mar all of which are much better than this cd.  Even the new Sleepthief cd is more ethereal and listenable and I recommend 
 This is the first book by Shaara I have read. And, if his other works are like this, it is also the last.    On the cover, J. Persico is quoted as saying Shaara makes "literature read like history and history read like literature."  He goes on to claim that Shaara brings the war to "pulsating life."  I have even read a review that claimed this book was better than Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front.    I must have been reading a different book.  The first chapter, The Replacement, is a great short story.  After reading it, I had hight expectations for the book.  Unfortunately, it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view.  And, the history reads like an 8th grade textbook.   His narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived.  They are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them.    After the dislocated short story of the first chapter, the book delves into a long-winded story of the flying aces, interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story.  It frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book.  Shaara doesn't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918's, when the Americans arrive, focusing, as I noted before, primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war. I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own.  Here, however, it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story. Or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the British or French perspective.   And, I have no particularly problem with him focusing on the American perspective on the war, but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry?  I suppose a smaller book doesn't sell as well.  For those interested in historical fiction, I would recommend Bernard Cornwall's work.  And, perhaps, Shaara can learn a bit from him 
 This is probably one of the most BORING autobiographies I have ever read. While Marianne Faithfull's autobiography is written almost as a novel, Bill writes as if just outlining the facts. All he talks about is how mean Mick and Keith were to him and how many women he slept with at the time (and bragging that that number was more than Mick and Keith combined). Poor Bill. Maybe if he had stood up for himself instead of sleeping with all those women, he might have gotten a say in the music once in a while! If you want riveting information about the Stones, read Marianne's book "Faithfull", if you want a cure for your insomnia, read "Stone Alone" 
 I had read this book many years ago and enjoyed it. The book was written 100 years ago, but does hold some truths of the world today. However, it appears to be a reproduction, the book was rather expensive for what I got - a slim paper back full of typo' 
 If you read this book looking for ways that your product, company, or whatever could be marketed for wild success then you will be disappointed with Tipping Point.  Gladwell has some interesting anecdotal stories about a few products that he hammers on but it wasn't at all obvious how these unique tales could ever be duplicated.  He builds up a theory of things needing to be Sticky, which is fine, but that was the closest i felt he had to a generalized theory.  Anyway, the stories of the businesses he covers are intersting and he's a good writer so you are likely to enjoy the read none-the-less 
 At first I was impressed by this book - but later quite disillusioned. I have been troubled for some time because I find the views and methods of the "christian right" to be quite out of keeping with my understanding of the Bible. As I read Robin Meyers book I found myself in close agreement with the ethical and political message he had to out across. But as the book progressed I realized that the Christianity I am following is a different religion from that taught by Rev.Meyers.       I would consider myself to have orthodox evangelical views. Rev. Myers is presenting the Bible as a series of myths to be interpreted along with the religious writings of other people. The Apostle Paul we are told was a repressed homosexual and his views on "gays" can therefore be disregarded. It is suggested that all worlds primary religions lead to the same God and - I think he is teaching - that the death of Jesus is glorifying the cycle of violence and revenge, and should be rejected as a means of salvation.        I came to understand that Rev. Meyers' is presenting a form of Christianity where the ethical teaching of Jesus (together with acceptable teaching form other sources) is the basis for personal morals and social/political action. While this is a perfectly reasonable philosphy - it is not the teaching of the Bible. This is a different religion from the mainstream teaching of the church for 2000 years.      This is perplexing. Can an evangelical Christian work for peace and justice alongside people of a different faith. Yes, of course. Does an evangelical Christian compromise their faith by working with people of another religion - albeit with a similar name. I think the answer is "no". So why does it matter?      As a manifesto for peace and social justice, this book is readable and compelling. But where must we look for a biblical understanding of these issues? Not in Robin Meyers book 
 As I read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by Mr. Cussler, the story was slow and the plot was transparent.     This book just didn't have the "zing" of the older Cussler stories.  If you are just laying around with nothing else to do it will give you something to read 
 I don't like this CD at all what happeed to the classy Monica???   Too Ghetto.... Such a waste of such a beautiful voice!!   
 Isn't this illegal or something?  To write a mystery (or anything for that matter) that simply has no ending? I don't think I've ever encountered anything quite like this before!  It's not that it's left up to the reader's imagination or anything like that.  The book just ends! No resolution of any kind.  Like there were pages torn out! Even if a story is to be continued in the next book of a series, fine but there has to be some explanation for the characters' actions and some kind of ending in order for the reader to be encouraged to come back for the rest of the story.  I actually quite enjoyed the first 2/3 of the book and assumed, stupidly I guess, that the author would pretty much tie things up so it was such a disappointment and actually downright insulting to find that the author simply doesn't care in the least about her readers. At the very least, the author and the reader have a silent understanding that the reader will be willing to excuse some errors or idiosyncratic writing or loose ends so long as the author provides the reader with a work that is sincere, entertaining and professional. I did my part. I paid my 10 bucks for the book, I read it until the very end and then the author let me down.  Not just because I didn't like the ending.  But because the author showed such disrespect for me, the reader, that she didn't even bother with an ending! I will never read another of Ms. Grimes books ever again.  What a cheat 
 I've always held the philosophy you are what you're entertained by. So, those who like Ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women. And speaking of women...Ludacris never met one who wasn't a h-o.  Ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men: you demean and look down on women for being h-oes, yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you'll have no problems getting laid. But then, you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you, so you go and find a "nice girl" because you can respect her and marry her and procreate with her. But then you cheat on her with a "bad girl" because h-oes need h-oes; but then you can't respect the "bad girl" because she's a slut, so you go back to the "good girl." But she's not nasty enough for you, so then...around and around we go. Women are basically being punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what the heck they want from us.  He's OBSESSED with sex and h-oes. It makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. Maybe Ludapis saw his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever. I guess if she had actually RAISED him and shown him how to respect women-- ALL women--then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is.   What's the music like? Well I'll give him 2 stars for mentioning TLC in What's Your Fantasy. That's it.  Addendum: 7/27-07 Some may wonder why I'm "wasting' my time giving Ludacris negative reviews. Well, first of all, if only people who liked the product were the only ones to review it, everything on Amazon would have 5 stars, which would be an inaccurate sign of its quality.   Secondly, I don't like Ludacris. I would give Ludacris more respect if I felt he gave my gender more respect; but he doesn't. My diatribe above shows what my problem with him is, and I feel that argument is valid. There's no way to critique Ludacris' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women. Why should I like him when he seems to have nothing but contempt for us? I'm biased against him because he's biased against me. So he gets a bad rating out of s-p-i-t-e 
      Coming from someone with extensive knowledge of all sides of the ID/evolution debate, arguments and the science thrown around, this is an under-researched over-vague interpretation of current science and the ID platform. Assembled in a way to convince the reader that he/she will win all the debates around the office water cooler, this book is further irritatingly acerbic and overtly biased.      If you are looking for a good probing to the gap between ID and evolution, look elsewhere, because even though written in 2004, this book brings, surprisingly, little-to-no fresh thoughts and too many old, overused points. Whether you want to win those debates (especially if your fellow debater is a well-read fellow) or you genuinely want further research on this subject, this is the wrong book.  Note: While negative, from the angle this review is written, one can not infer the standpoint or lack thereof the reviewer has. I would encourage such to all reviewers who want to be regarded with integrity, especially when concerning a sensitive subject like this. Again, if you think you know my stance on this issue from this, you're wrong. Thanks for reading 
 This coffee maker is beautiful, however, it has a problem.  The on off switch sticks a lot.  Kitchen Aid replaced the entire system for me a  few times and finally I gave up and bought a cheaper more reliable coffee maker.  All the replacements they sent to me developed the same problem 
 I would have purchased this ridiculous item if not for the comment above.  Thanks for alerting me to the misleading information 
 The sad reality is that year after year fewer American students are going into the fields of science and the best students (and teachers) are increasingly brought in from overseas. Most recently non-citizens in the U.S. have received more Phds in the sciences and engineering than citizens.   The fact that (un-)intelligent design is given a sounding board or that idiots like Phd theologians are pining on scientific theory shows how far we've fallen behind. In a generation or two moronic ID theories will vie hand in hand with New Age idiot beliefs while leadership in real science and technology migrates to Europe and Asia.  Shame 
 I've been reading this book as part of a Bible study. This book rubs me the wrong way in so many ways.        The sample prayers in the book are genuine and meaningful, and I think if prayed from the heart, God can bring meaningful change to a marriage realtionship. But the overall view of prayer in this book is so incomplete and shallow. Stormie presents prayer as a one sided dialog with God, in which we ask for something and wait for an answer.         No where is prayer defined as a dialog with God. For Stormie, prayer is simply standing in front of some sort of spiritual vending machine, pressing buttons and waiting for a item to drop down. There is nothing wrong with the prayers in the book, they are just so gimme-gimme-gimme in nature, they miss the whole point of knowing and standing in the presense of God. And while many prayers do involve asking God for something, they can be so much more. A book on prayer should communicate this to some degree.        Stormie presents a very well polished good submissive wife attitude throughout the entire book. I find many Christians have this attitude, and to varying degrees, many of these Christians actually demean one another as a result. To Stormie, and many other Christians, marriage is not truly a partnership or a relationship. Stormie says many people confuse the terms 'obey' and 'submit', and I agree with her, wholeheartedly. However, I would submit to you she is one of the confused people!         To her, and countless other Christians, a husband's leadership is simply taking all factors into account and making a decision. If a wife sees he is considering her feelings and desires in making his decision, as well as yielding to God's leading for his family, the wife should happily and willfully follow his leading, even if she disagrees with him. No encouragement to discuss the matter is given, Stormie does not suggest dialog between the husband and wife; the wife must simply follow. There is actually nothing wrong with a husband and wife agreeing to conduct their marriage like this, but I don't think there is a strong case for this type of marriage presented in the Bible.         Stormie uses so many stereotypes, I often feel like I'm reading 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus'. Men having deep and soothing voices, her commentary about having a serious conversation with her husband while he was watching a baseball game, and in her discussion of moods, calling men simple and straightforward and women complicated. All these are sterotypes.        Stereotypes in general don't work to illustrate your point, because they have such a weak foundation. For example, I know many husbands who do not have deep voices. Many men have no interest in sports. For those who enjoy sports, if their wife was talking to them in the middle of the game, I know many men who would stop to listen, or at the very least clearly communicate to their wife that this isn't the best time for a serious discussion. And on the many moods of women and the simplicity of men, I know of cases where the exact opposite is true.        Stormie has her heart in the right place, but honestly, I think she misses the boat here. She is extremely superficial at times, rarely digging very deep into scriptural foundations for what she is writing. Also, I don't think she was the right person to write this book. She is a woman instructing men on how to pray for their wives. This formula makes as much sense as going to a unmarried man for maritial counselling.         I think many people gain the most from this book by considering their wives point of view and providing for them by praying for them. I think many husbands have probably never stopped to consider praying for their wives, and this book might really open up their eyes. In this respect, I suppose the book does accomplish what it sets out to do. If you are looking for depth, substance, and an accurate biblical foundation on which to build your marriage, this book probably won't hurt. But I would encourage you, don't let this be the only book you read on marriage 
 Call me a glutton for punishment, but I read many of the I-Hate-The-Clintons trash that is published and is trotted out as serious reading.  (you would think that books like this one are written with crayon)   I do it to try to understand why a President who was responsible for giving this nation the longest sustained period of PEACETIME ECONOMIC EXPANSION, who headed a shrinking government, who reduced waste and left office with a balanced budget and a surplus as well, makes right-wingers HATE him so much.  Was it that he had the temerity to beat george h w bush, for the job of president?  Or, was it that republicans simply hate to see the American Dream realized?    IF you can read aldrich's book, and if you don't feel the need to be cleansed by holy fire in order to feel clean once more, then this is your kind of hate-book.    However, if you do have a soul and you don't want to sift through more lies than a fox news broadcast, try a book by Joe Conason, at least you'll be assured of truth and some A+ writing.    This aldrich fella should stick to writing traffic tickets and lying to traffic court judges....  Yes your honor, she was going 30 in the 20 mph zone......... very good mr aldrich, very good! 
 Not a very good or entertaining book.  More of a ramblimg egomaniac's diary.  The book did not contain much detail on the events and jumped around way too much.  He tries to make himself into a heavy and when it got hot he turned 
 I haven't read this book, but it seems like a travellers tall tale, aka. tour-guide history to amuse city slickers.  Better to rent City Slickers.  Some facts to ponder:  --gold in the natural state, as in free Au nuggets, was depleted by prehistoric man.  So if gold nuggets exist, why didn't the Apache themselves pick it up?  Do we really need crusty old miners?  That said, if you're talking sluicing gold using heavy industrial equipment, including mercury/ quicksilver, that's a different story.  But the idea of old english-speaking miners finding gold nuggets lying around is ludicrous  --if there's gold in them thar hills, somebody would have found it, not unlike Suiter Mill (CA '49ers); Virginia City (Ag), NV; Klondyke gold fields, even (and especially) South Africa, where the gold is a mile below the surface.  Point being: real gold is like money, it attacts real people.  "Lost gold" only attracts readers (gullible readers) and tourists.  I give the book two stars since the author knows what he is talking about:  spinning a yarn, even a plausible yarn.  For that he gets credit 
 Purists will argue that once an author has died then his output has finished. Others will argue that there's no compelling reason not play in someone else's imaginary universe if there are good new stories to be told. Certainly there's a thriving market for new Sherlock Holmes stories. I myself don't mind a continuation novel or pastiche if it's well written and captures the flavour of the original.  This book fails on both counts for me. Ultimately this is just a mystery with robots in it. Without Asimov's name to spruik it I doubt most of us would bother picking it up. Tiedemann is not a bad author but this is dry, technical stuff for the most part. His characters aren't badly drawn and there's some mildly interesting discussion of new aspects of the Three Laws but there's long, dense passages of technobabble that simply beg to be skimmed.  Some will like the dense, convoluted conspiracy, I found it tedious.   Bottom line is I'm not inspired to read the other two books in the series, which about sums up my indifference to this one 
 7 Seconds is a formulaic capper that's not entertaining at all. The car chases are ok, but nothing to write home about. It's a regular Snipes movie, but lacking fun. It's long, illogical (which isnt bad if it's entertaining),  and just plain boring 
 Never could get this to work with Windows Media Edition. After hours of trying and multiple tech support contacts from Creative I finally got a smart tech person to say "We don't make drivers for Windows Media Edition for your webcam It won't work." Not up to speed. Don't buy from Creative Labs 
 My husband suffered a severe Traumatic Brain Injury on 4/16/02.  After every TBI, no matter how mild or severe, personalities are changed.  That means losing your original loved one and grieving him, yet knowing he is still here, but very different physically, cognitively and emotionally  I was hoping to get some help with this book on accepting my grief and moving on with whatever is left of our lives together. However, I found that it was mostly about congenital disabilities and those where the loved ones' personality basically stays the same. I was disappointed that still no one seems to acknowledge how difficult it is to be a spouse and caregiver to a loved one who has sustained a Traumatic Brain Injury.  I am hoping to see more written about it in the future.  It is a unique phenomena that only those of us who live with it seem to know about.  
 After receiving, putting together and using this toy with myself and children, I overestimated what it would be.  I remember the old school Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots, and this product isn't even close.  The old characters stood 6-8" tall and both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was delivered.  This version has only plastic parts, the characters are 4" tall at best, and the 'win' is from a blow to the chest, not the head.  Metallo's head springs up, but Superman's head only nods backward.  It is difficult to discern the 'winner' from the set up.  It was only an $11 lesson for me to learn, but if you truly want a real Rock 'em set, try eBay, or yard sales.  This replica is not comparable to the original 
 I know I'll sound like an uneducated dolt, but after you look thru the pictures once or twice, there's really not much else to do.  Don't get me wrong--it's visually quite a pleasing book, but my kids are young enough (below kindergarten) that part of the draw of bedtime is words and rhymes that we do the same way every night.  Sitting in silence and turning pages doesn't work too well with three kids, because they can't all sit in my lap at the same time.  And did I mention there's very few words??  No thanks.. 
 These were a sticky mess in the bag - the fruit juice leaked from the lollypops and leaked out of the plastic wrap.  They were also soft and seemed stale.  Great ingredients, but the final product was disappointing 
 Prentice-Hall is notorious for sloppy textbooks, and this book is in the company tradition.  The text was not edited, proofread, or fact-checked.  The glossary entry for wash sales is egregious, but almost any page provides examples.  All information in this book is therefore suspect 
 THIS BOOK DOES NOT EVEN MENTION CLARA BOW, ALONG WITH GRETA GARBO, THE GREATEST ACTRESS OF THE SILENT FILM ERA, AND ONE OF OUR GREATEST EVER. BUY SOMETHING ELSE OR YOU ARE BEING SERIOUSLY MISLED BY THE DIRECTION THE AUTHOR TAKES 
 I was disappointed with this book.  I knew it would have bits from the author's previous books plus new words of wisdom.  But each page only had one sentence of advice. I thought she'd write a little bit about each suggestion like in her previous books.  i'm glad I bought this book used.  Otherwise it was a waste of money for me. 
 I was really looking forward to settling in with this book and having a good laugh.  Instead, what I found was a pretentious book where the author tried way too hard to be funny . . . and very little of it actually was.  The author definitely has a way of turning a phrase in an original way, but you cannot hang an entire chapter on one cute phrase.  Reading this book was just way too much effort and not nearly fun enough.  Yuck 
 I cannot give a point-by-point critique of the book, however a good peek into the composition of the book came when the author appeared on the radio show Air Talk.  When a professor profiled in the book claimed his profile had innacuracies, Horowitz HIMSELF admitted the profile was written by someone whom he himself did not know.  This is the author himself saying that the book he claims to have written contains elements he cannot vouch for because he did not write them and has no idea who did.  This is sloppiness that calls any other fact in the book into question.  Is a particular write up on a professor a fair perspective or revenge by someone who got a 'D'.  We really can't tell if the author admits he did no real fact checking 
 The 33 1/3 series is a gift and when I saw they were writing a book on one of my all time favorite recordings, OK Computer, I couldn't have been happier.    The book in a word however, blows.  Much of the book is dedicated to some aimless theories about the place of LP records and cds in the broad landscape of musicology.  Considering how painfully short this book is to begin with, it seems like a perfect waste of space - filler for an academic journal.  When the author does get around to the actual work of Radiohead, he almost exclusively refers to the musical score and references much of their work as only "sound effects."  While his analysis of the notes on the page is at times compelling, he fails miserably to describe "musical" and "technical" choices not accounted for in the score and their impact on the recording.  While other books in series may at times be criticized for being too journalistic, and speculating at the intent of the musicians, here the author goes to far in the other direction -- there isn't even a mention of the unique recording space this album was crafted in, not to mention any speculation as to the effect it might have had.  Nigel Godrich the producer (along with the band) and engineer is reduced merely a mention, any notion of sculpting sound with studio tools is non-existent.   Considering the direction the band has pursued after this record, highly electronic and diffuse by western musical standards, this book serves little interesting purpose, but perhaps to serve as a footnote in a more comprehensive book by an author who can synthesize the roll of the composer with the concept of a recording as piece of art that is constructed with a different set of skills than the score it maybe also represented by.  In short, don't bother buying this book if you want to read anything about Radiohead the band or how they create music.  This one will have little interest to anyone but musicology students and most of them will find it painfully incomplete as well. 
 DO NOT ORDER THIS BOOK FROM AMAZON.COM. I ordered it 6 weeks ago from them, and it has yet to ship. Even though it still says IN STOCK and SHIPS WITHIN 24 HOURS, this book has not been shipped to me yet. I recommend looking at www.bn.com, where they ship very quickly 
 I bought this monitor because it was affordable and I thought it would be an easier and faster way to check my BP regularly.  It is easy to use, but I got much different readings than the readings I got from my arm cuff, the Dr and several other sources. I returned it and will stick with what works for me 
 I suppose I'm going to be alone in these reviews in complaining loudly about Ellis's stylistic sloppiness.  I recall a particularly amusing section in the introduction in which he describes Jefferson's message in the Declaration as "a recipe for anarchy," and proceeds to note that a government which "attempted to operate in accordance with these principles would be committing suicide."  Yes, Joseph, a government attempting to implement no government would be doing itself in.  Is this what passes for lofty criticism these days?  I picked up this book in an effort to become more interested in--and more fair to--Thomas Jefferson.  I went in believing him to be a cold, conniving man whose life was a long exercise in "do what I say, not what I do."  This book did nothing to change that impression; if anything changed, it was my opinion of Ellis, of whom I'd had somewhat higher hopes.  His writing is not nearly good enough to cover up his attempted slights of hand in excusing Jefferson's worst characteristics; in my book, "psychological agility" isn't distinguished from hypocrisy--it IS hypocrisy.    The book's tone reminded me rather startlingly of the modern theory texts I was once forced to read; full of unprovable suppositions and distinctions without differences.  
 This book does have alot of different dips, but not much info on how to have a fondue "party".  It doesn't explain in detail the equipment you need or how to set everything up.  The only good thing about the book is that there are lots of pictures for preparation and presentation of the dips 
 This books seems interesting until you learn (within a few pages) that the author forbids masturbation at any time and basically sees sex as a crude animal instinct.  If you're a big Bill Bennett fan you might enjoy this, but for those inerested in developing a little more restraint while still participating to some small degree in modernity, look elsewhere.  BTW, Mr. O'Reilly, the world is NOT a more brutish place than ever before.  Sad, to say, it's almost certainly less so.  
 As a life long resident of the state of Oklahoma, I have to state I really did not like this book.  As other reviewers have mentioned the geography errors alone were enough to make me crazy.  I found myself talking out loud to the author as I read the book regarding her complete ignorance of Oklahoma geography.  We know how beautiful our state is here in Oklahoma and we are proud of the various biomes represented in our geography.  My question is if the author was going to use a fictional town, why throw in any references to real places?  She could have avoided the massive number of errors by just keeping it all fictional.  If you want to use a real place, use it, if not, keep it fictional.  There were also numerous errors in meteorology others have mentioned.  For example, she stated a "tornado warning" had been issued for an entire region of the state.  Those of us who live in tornado alley know "warnings" are only listed for specific counties and places and really mean there has been a tornado sighted and you should take cover immediately, they are not listed for entire regions of a state.  That would be a "tornado watch".  That is only one example, there are many.  Don't waste your money on this book, there are many that are much better 
 Wendy Slatkin has produced an introduction to a subject which deserves a more indepth study. She offers a outline of women artists and their work that is, however, suitable for a beginning class of Art History students. It crys out for a broader scope and more detailed research, particularily in the area of 20th Century artists. It is, in this sense, an inspirational 'textbook' 
 I was anxious to read the books written by this author since they take place near Charleston, a place we visit often.  I was very disappointed!  This book should have ended about 3 chapters earlier.  The book lacked depth and character development.  The dialogue was contrite and superficial.  I will definitely NOT be reading anymore books from this author 
 Somewhere in the universe, statistically speaking, there has to be a band more stultifying than Rush. It's hard to imagine that God could be so cruel, but remember, she gave us Boston (the band, that is) too. This stuff is so painful, it almost makes rap sound good 
 This is NOT a high-end luxury towel by Grand Patrician and is not ultra in ANY way. Even if they were firsts, they are second rate. Mine started to self-destruct after the first wash, and never had the absorbency of a wet dish rag.  Am disappointed Amazon would carry this product, which would be a bad deal at half the price. Next time I will look for more reviews 
 This is a tough read.  He gets so bogged down in the details that I forgot what I was reading about 
 I'm part way into this book, I have about 200 pages left, and I'm already confused.   For instance how is everyone in the little unheard of community of Ravenkill right up with the happenings in The Hague?  Does world wide news reach little burgs that fast.  And what was with Andrew Franconia the innkeeper that he calls the US Marshalls as soon as Maggie registers?   I don't get it, everyone seems to know what everyone else is doing faster than they can move about.   So I guess I'll have to finish the story to find all the answers if they are revealed 
 I was under the impression that this book would provide the information I needed to cultivate these plants on some scale.  I was very disappointed.  There is no way that you could reliably produce these plants with the information provided in this book.  There are much better books out there for that purpose.  If you are a novice, homegardener wanting to learn about wildflowers and grow a few in your backyard, this book would be okay for you.  But if you are knowledgeable on the topic already, I think you will be disappointed 
 I think that the book had lots of cute ideas but they all require lots of separate materials that I did not already have in my vast collection of cardmaking and scrapbooking supplies. You could use the basic ideas and modify them to make your own cards though 
 This is one of the worst books I read in the past year. If it weren't for its place in history and its importance as the first first-person book written by an African-American author, I probably would've given it one  star. The narrative style is painful, the plot feels meandering and silly,  and it's just plain not worth reading. The narrator's "earnest"  style starts to grate after about 30 pages, and from there on the book just  goes bonking along to nowhere. The ending is terrible, as well 
 This book has been the most difficult book I have every used.  I have found more useful information from atlas.asp.net then in this book.  Almost every example that I used has had either old syntax errors or just plain syntax errors.  In spending so much time finding the errors, I feel the book should be called "Where's Atlas" 
 I find it annoying that the author includes Chicago in the same tier as NY and LA.  How can the buckle of the midwest rustbelt be in the same league as the premier coastal cities?  It's absurd I tell you 
 I liked these earrings when I got them.  They were smaller than I hoped but would wear them anyway.  I lost one earring the first time I wore IT!!!!! I am so bummed! So if you get them put a back on the wire part of the earring 
 While the author has some good ideas for start-up businesses, she is behind the times.  Keep in mind it was most recently published 6 years ago.  Read it to get ideas, but don't count on it to reflect current trends.   According to the author, typing, word processing, old school computer  languages, and pagers are all in hot demand 
 I picked up this unit hoping that it would do the job in my backyard, all that it has picked up is a few "flying insects" nothing else.  Unless I am missing something, do not waste your money 
 I bought this when it first came out in 72, and I pity 14 year old kids today who don't have a record like this "to do all the things that kids aren't supposed to do" to (if that makes any sense).  If my old vinyl copy could talk, I'd be in jail for the rest of my life.  That is, if I could find the damn thing.  And that's a BIG deal, because the remastering of this album completely ruins one of the wildest listening experiences ever created.  On the original album, every tune sounded like it was recorded in different venue with a different producer.  Every mix was completely different, and by objective standards, unbelievably horrible.  By subjective standards, however, the uniquely ridiculous sound of each track made for one of the ten best rock and roll albums ever. "Search and Destroy" was all trebled-out, overdriven Stratocasters and virtually no bass, with an up-front metallic clanking throughout that really hurt the ears, even at low volumes (listen to any track on the Mary Chain's Psychocandy to hear roughly what it used to sound like).  Raw Power growled away muddily, with lots more low-end sludge than on this version.  Death Trip sounded just like the name implies, with the lead guitar sounding like it was recorded with the mike about an inch away from the amp, and turned up to 11 with an outrageous treble boost.  Shake Appeal (which fares best on this CD) sounded like it was recorded in muddy mono, until the up-riff ended, and then the power chords exploded in a huge wall of stereo sound, and then shrank back to mono (the effect was mind-boggling at high volume).  But the crown-jewel, the piece-de-resistance, was "Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell."  If ever a dirtier, sludgier fast rocker was ever recorded (with Iggy's absurd growling-screeching buried behind the wall of unbelievably distorted guitars and bass)I've never heard it.  Just thinking about the way it used to sound after a micro-dot is putting a big smile on my face.  But it doesn't sound anything like that on this remaster, nor does any other track sound remotely as good as on the original (with the possible exception of Shake Appeal, which I preferred in the old mix but which has a lot of power in the new version). And unless you've ever heard the original release, you can't possibly imagine the roll that the right mix can play in turning an excellent album into something that changes your life (not always for the "better" in this case). I've been collecting records and CD's compulsively for over 30 years, much to the detriment of floor-space in my domicile, and I've never seen a re-mastering ruin an album the way Raw Power has been eviscerated.  The re-mastering is really loud, but that's not the point.  I've got a volume control to deal with the relatively low levels of the old masters.  For the love of all that's Holy, somebody get ahold of the original masters that were used on the old albums and re-release this thing.  Then, kiddies, you're in for some real fun 
 This book seems more like a review of records then adding anymore info. I doubt if any more research has gone in to this book then average high school graduate goes through. I felt it was a waste of time and money  Panka 
 As to the people commenting on the below reviews being self-promotion, let me just say that I work in a chain-bookstore which has recently been hit by a plague of special orders for this book by a person whose address and phone number don't really exist. The book in non-returnable to the publisher, so we are stuck with it on our shelves. I'll let you try to figure out for yourself who that person might be 
 I had heard of the importance, and significance of "The Education of Henry Adams" for a long time. I finally determined I needed to read it.  I acutally read it twice, and found less in it the second time than the first.   I am sorry  I missed the greatness of this book. I am sure there was something wrong with me, but I found it to be incredibly unimpressive.   Perhaps this came from the fact that Henry Adams was not a likeable man. He was famous for holding court in his home near the White House, and making caustic and negative comments about every President who lived there.   Granted, he lived in Washington at a time when there were plenty of second-rate occupants of the White House. But the thought of people wasting their time trying to please  a blue-blooded snob like Adams depresses me. Why did anyone bother? He lived in an atmosphere of snobbery, sharp-tongues, clever remarks, and brilliant conversation. The world went on without him, truth be told, and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day.   He was a very good historian in his time. But who reads his books now? Not very many. In short, his own work was not as long-lasting as he would have wanted it to be. Maybe the influence of some of the Presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of Henry Adams.  "The Education of Henry Adams" does not have much real information. He got education in one place, none in others. Surely, the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for Henry--but he wrote nothing about it in his book.   When Eric Sevareid wrote "Not So Wild a Dream," it was compared to "The Education of Henry Adams." That was meant as a compliment. Oddly, I think Sevareid's book is much, much better. Sevareid wrote of America, the common man, the war, and what it all meant to him. Adams needed to get out more. He did not see America--not the America built by the common citizen who put it all together, and defended it.  I gained a trememdous amount from Sevareid. I cannot say the same for the work of Henry Adams.   Again, a lot of this might be me. Perhaps I read the book at a bad time. Maybe I needed to read it a third time. I do not know. I do know I do not think this is a great American classic. Forgive, please, my ignorance. 
 Sorry folks this one is a pain to figure out before getting knocked out by a flying plastic disc with scratch prone edges. Great for taking out an eye or blinding the user permanently. NOT suggested for kids without protective face gear and an interpretor of the directions wlll need to be present at all times. Parents will be spending more time with it than the kids trying to get it to work properly. My 6 year old was done with it as soon as I figured it out.  the upside At least we spent more time together reading and doing crazy moves 
 I was hoping for some more info on the bigfoot mystery, but all I got was an X-rated comic book that couldn't hold my interest.  So anyone wanting to know more about the monster needs to go elsewhere 
 Many of the ideas in this book are very contradicting to the bible however he does bring up some good points. Read C.S. Lewis' responce to this book entiteled "The Great Divorce" 
 A retrospective of the photographer's work, not useful as a guide to how to. And of kinds of buildings we're not likely to photograph today. Didn't help me with clues to photographing interiors 
 This is a very poor quality audio which has been abridged to leave out some of the best parts of the play. It leaves out half of the first act, including John of Gaunt's famous "this septer'd isle..this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England". Richard II whines throughout, and Henry IV hardly exists. Find another audio 
 I think irridium said it most articulately, but I just wanted to add to the hate for this book.  I have never experienced such a strong visceral negative reaction to any work of literature.  Save yourself some time and read Nabokov's Ada instead 
 I was really looking forward to using this book on our next trip to Paris, until I read the section in which it defines Jean-Marie Le Pen's Front National party as an "extremist, racist party". I mean, after the events over the past year (car burnings, riots, cartoons, etc) it would behoove Mr. Steve's to pray that Le Pen's party wins the next election, or he will be writing a book on how to speak Arabic instead of Frenc 
 This book is horrible - not at all funny.  Waste of money - good thing it was relatively cheap.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone 
 The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.  Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time 
 I would give it negative stars but that wasn't an option. This thing is horrible...doesn't cut very close, certainly doesn't hold a charge, engine noise slows down and dies out after about 5 minutes. And oh yeah...the horrible razor burn!!! Seriously the razor burn was horribly painful even with shaving creams 
 One reviewer of this book said that this book was a "recipe for appeasement" and that were the world to recommend genocide, or a return to slavery, that this book would imply that this ought to be America's policy!  Well, is that reviewer right about this book?  After reading the book, I think the reviewer is right.    The author makes the point that opponents of the United States try to delegitimize us.  He's right; they do.  But the response to this ought to be to do what is best, not to appease our enemies.  Appeasement generally makes matters worse for everyone.  I think if we have the ability to support truth, justice, human rights, peace, and prosperity, we ought to do so, even if it may sometimes mean battling thugs and tyrants.  The portion of this book that I'm best able to judge is about Israel.  I'm a Pagan and a Zionist.  And the author does a bad job of describing America's informal alliance with Israel.  He somewhat exaggerates the strength of the Israeli lobby here, and in addition, he makes it appear somewhat sinister, as if it were causing America to support policies that are against our own interests.  In fact, it is very difficult for small nations to convince us to act against our interests.  It is far easier for small nations to agree to do what we say (in an attempt to become or remain our allies) or for small nations to benefit from getting our support when America's enemies attack them.  Yes, the Israeli lobby has done well, but the main reason for this is that it has an excellent product to sell!  Israel is a nation which is being attacked by some reactionary and racist thugs and tyrants.  The nation most slandered by the United Nations and the international community is Israel.  No wonder plenty of decent people find it easy to support it.  The Israeli lobby isn't needed to convince most American opponents of all this slander and aggression.  Walt does not mention any of this, of course.  There is a big difference between being in favor of human rights for all and supporting all policies of the State of Israel.   Walt certainly agrees.  But he implies that American Zionists tend to support the latter, not the former.  And that's not true at all.  There's plenty of opposition by Zionists to specific Israeli policies, and it is an anti-Zionist untruth to say that one can't object to Israeli government policies without running afoul of the Zionist lobby.  Such excuses are often used by those who deny Israel's right to exist (presumably in order to deny human rights to Levantine Jews) and then try to say that they merely disagree with some policies of the Israeli government.  In addition, Walt fails to discuss the extent to which some American Jews disagree not only with Israeli policies, but even with the idea that Israeli Jews ought not be denied human rights.  Walt implies that Israel wants "to impose an unjust solution unilaterally" to its dispute with the Arabs.  That's ridiculous.  If there is peace, Israel wins: it gets to stay on the map and prosper on land it is making excellent use of.   That's why Israel is willing to put up with a solution which cheats the Jews out of land they would otherwise be entitled to keep or purchase.  It is anything but unjust to the Arabs to let Israel have less than its fair share of land!  Or to allow human rights for all the people of the region!  The author also comes up with the taunt that denying Arabs "their legitimate political rights has not made Israel safer."  That's outrageous.   There is no legitimate right to dissolve a neighboring nation and get rid of the human rights of its people.  And it does not make one "safer" to agree to get rid of one's human rights, quite the contrary.  He's simply blaming Israel for the aggression and slander against it.  At one point, Walt even asks "why should other Arabs believe that the United States is committed to freedom when its money and power are used to deny these rights to millions" of Levantine Arabs.  Well, I think that there are plenty of flaws with American foreign policy.   However, in my opinion, we deserve quite a bit of praise for supporting human rights in the Levant.  We could do better.  But if we take the author's advice, we'll be doing much, much worse.  I do not recommend this book. 
 Before all Evanovich fans blast me double barrels, please note: This refers to the audio CD, abridged version of High Five. It was my first J.E. novel & I thought would be the last.  Having read many customer reviews, I might have to try reading one instead of listening.   I found the story to be limp & quite elementary.  Chief problem: the AUDIO CD reader whose lisp is most annoying.  It sounds as though she's auditioning for a part in a high school play...one she won't get.  Or auditioning for the role of "Thindy" Brady of Brady Bunch fame...a part she's destined to play.  Is there something poignant about the selection of this particular reader?  She does Evanovich no justice. The story begins with a missing uncle report...main character "Stephanie's" missing uncle, that is.  Oddly, no one reports that he's missing for 2 days & none seem very concerned about his disappearance.  I found it extremely odd that the family would discuss his absence "over coffecake as is customary in the 'burg in New Jersey."  Pardon me, I'm not from "the 'burg" or NJ but it's really a stretch to believe that everyone from the "'burg" casually discusses the case of a missing relative while dining on coffeecake. Attempts at humor are pathetic, such as: "I got my shower; jumped out & dried my hair by way of styling it."  What????  "Ranger" naturally drives a Ranger (creative genius there).  Stephanie goes on a job & forgets her gun (was I supposed to fret or laugh?  Who knows w/this reader's tonal quality). The novel continues, yet still no one concerns themselves with the missing uncle.  Stephanie sleeps around with carefree abandon but it is tough to take seriously while listening to that lisp!  Characters appear & we really have no clue as to why they immerged onto the scene. (Maybe the clue was in book 1, 2, 3 or 4??) Again, this is the AUDIO version.  The reader's voice works as well as Michael Jackson reading the Da Vinci Code...a no can do! After listening to the audio version of High Five, I can emphatically state: sometimes words are better left unspoken (just read them!) 
 The Alberts text (Molecular Biology of the Cell, Fourth Edition) is superior to this text in every way. It is clearer, more precise, and contains more information. This one manages to make simple concepts become quite difficult 
 I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.  Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing.  The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along.  By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one 
 How very disappointed I was with this reading.  It became a chore and I made myself finish it.  How sad since Mr. Bourdain is so talented with his writing and humor.  Don't bother.  He has become too big for his book binder/britches 
 I felt as if I were reading a book for teens - the plot was thin and continued to hold one theme as the central "mystery" or glue to hold the story together.  It was tiresome and even the ending was a disappointment.  The author wrote in southern cliche's which failed to bring humor to a tiresome, drug out subject. Unlike the author's book Sunday Wife - it seemed to fail in it's delivery.  
 God was a man. His name was Jesus Christ. Learn about Him if you want to Learn about God. True, he's not going to make you feel better about yourself without challenging you to change, as most new age philsophers will. But he'll bring you to God. No one else can. no one 
 Just not my cup of tea.  Well written but as I said not my cup of tea..I will not purchase the others in the series 
 You won't be sorry buying this other book instead! It is in full color NOT like this book, 95% in Black in white. The instructions are not that clear for a visual learner like me. The other book: Creating Flowers With Beads and Theads allowed me to pick it up and start beading! 
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 Trying to figure out the point. Language is good...but content Zip. I normally don't put books down half way. Am very tempted to do it with this one. Can't believe this won an awar 
 I gave Mirette On The High Wire only 2 stars because it was very predictable. The only fair part of the book was the pictures. They might have been an alright nomination, but definitely should not have won. It was predictable when Belini said no to Mirette to teach her to walk on the wire. I believe it was a very bad book 
 This is one of the all time worst electronic engineering books I have ever encountered.  A few minutes searching the Maxim web site will find most of the material.  90% of the examples are simply reprints from Maxim data sheets, or Maxim app. notes and engineering handbooks.  Most of the material is out of date, even allowing for the book being 10 years old.   It does not cover modern battery technologies (such as LiIon, or LiPoly), and does not really cover any of the "stuff" other than the switching supply itself.  Notable by not being there would be any material on micropower processors, logic, interfacing across logic families, latchup, linear peripherals, low power switching, protection, design techniques, measurements, and a host of others.  A better title might have been "Some out of date Maxim medium power Switcher Datasheets briefly explained".  Sorry John -- you have published some good work, but this isn't it 
 This would be a great compilation, but they chose to include the live version of "Over My Head" instead of the studio version. WHY?!!! The live version stinks. And "Over My Head" is a fan favorite. It's probabaly the first song most of us ever head by King's X....because Atlantic sure didn't do much to promote "Out Of The Silent Planet"! Nope...we had to wait until Headbanger's Ball brought King's X to our collective attention. The STUDIO version of "Over My Head" is a powerful piece of work. And they deliberately replaced it with the weaker live cut. Again, WHY?!! Because the record companies are so busy tryig to be in tune with TRENDS, that the are totally out of touch with the FANS! If they really wanted to make a good compilation they would have given us studio versions of the hits, and given us better live cuts like "Manic Depression" From Dogman. Screw these record company buttheads. 
 While few can argue Mark's rise to fame and fortune is anything but spectacular, but to believe that virtually every decision he's made in his life has turned out fantastically well is a bit hard to swallow. At every turn (which happens to be accompanied by the phrase..."I jumped in...") is another remarkable success.   If he showed a bit more vulnerability in his stories, it would have been more believable, insightful and inspirational.   I also could have done without excruciating detail of every season of survivor...it got a bit old 
 First, let me say that by quality film standards this is a terrible movie, in many respects. I live to walk on videos of this type with football cleats. But, this movie falls into the "I hated this movie so much, I couldn't help but watch it whenever it was on" category. And now I love it. I don't know what it is about this movie. I tried to put my finger on it many times. I always have and always will hate "Sleepless in Seattle," which is a totally contrived load of crap. But "You've Got Mail" has an undefinable charm to it that forces you to look past it's simplified portrayal of a happy go lucky, skip around the neighborhoods of New York atmosphere. It makes you question why you buy into such sappy dialogue and situations. It's not just because of the Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks chemistry, because I hated the despicable "Sleepless in Seattle" and always thought the entire premis of "Joe Versus the Volcanoe" was a joke. But in this movie, contrived as it may be, that interplay between the two works. Though their acting is also hammy at best, I also love the contributions of Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Stephen Zahn and Jean Stapleton. This is one of my guiltiest pleasures. I'll only watch it with the remote on toggle to some type of sports programming in case my friends walk in on me while I'm watching it so I can jump inmmediately to the "Binford Lumberjack Finals," or something like that. But were they to walk in at the end of this movie and find me glossy eyed with a lump in my throat, I'd never hear the end of it. I love this movie. There! I admit it. 
 This book, this so called scientific social book, is a tower constructed by lies and half truths based upon the author's (and the liberal media's) hatred toward Christians.  There is no such thing as a war against science by Republicans and the Christians.  There IS such a thing as a war against God, very easily  seen in such "I hate Christians" books like this one, but that is to be considered later on.  Basically, this book is a 342 page book founded upon Christianphobia.  It is a witch hunter's book that tries to demean and belittle and lie about Christians.  I will make this brief, but specific on two examples.  1) Darwinism and 2) Abortion and Stem-Cell Research.    Why do I feel the need to stand up against the idea of teaching children about Evolution?  Why do I want to stand up against the humanistic agenda of destroying the minds and souls of our children?  Why do I feel the need to push for the consideration of Intelligent Design to be offered toward these same children?  Because evolution is false.  Evolution is not true.  Evolution holds no solid ground.  Have I studied evolution?  Yes.  Before becoming a Christian I was an outspoken apostle of Evolution until I was shown the facts and the facts are this...evolution is a fallacy and the only reason why Evolution is being so championed in the class rooms is because the humanist/liberal hate Christians.  They call us anti-intellectuals, strangely enough, and  yet the driving force of the liberal party is a paranoid dilution driven hatred toward Christians.  Here are some authors and their titles that I challenge you with:  Ralph Muncaster's Dismantling Evolution; Phillip Johnson's Darwin on Trial; David Snoke's A Biblical Case for an Old Earth; and finally, Fazale Rana and Hugh Ross' Who was Adam.    Then there is abortion.  What is so scientific about abortion?  You kill a child.  Simple.  Why should the scientific community care so much about abortion?  Because they do not understand the concept of human rights (their human rights are rights that go along with whatever the PC pop culture has to say this week).  Stem-Cell research is a tag along on the abortion supporting train because these so called scientists want you the reader to think that if the two do not go together then all these people will die a painful death if Stem-Cell research is not provided.  Abortion in itself is murder.  Simple as that.  You murder a child.  A child with a mind, a child with a heart, and a child with a soul.  That is not emotional blackmail toward women, that is just the simple truth.  And Stem-Cell research?  You do not have to harvest embryos like some scientist and politician out of Brave New World.  There are far better ways, far safer way, to study Stem-Cell and how it may or may not help those who are in need.  I suggest you read works such as ProLife Answers to ProChoice Arguments by Randy Alcorn    There is no Republican war against science.  There are many scientists like David Snoke and Hugh Ross that stand up and support the truth that comes, from the very heart of the matter, from the Bible.  Republicans and Christians do not long for some "Dark Age" of society.  They, we, I, want the truth to be shown in society away from the liberal bewitching Christianphobic fanaticism that comes from those like Sam Harris and Chris Mooney 
 First I want to state all the good things about this book - because they are certainly the principles of this book.  Dr. Andrew Weil's Eating Well for Optimum Health holds a wealth of information. Starting with the chemistry of how your body handles food and then explaining how that affects the goods and bads of what's out there is the basis in which Weil promotes his theories. In a world where foods become vilified and championed alike through various 'studies'... it can be intimidating to know what you should include in an 'optimum diet'. Weil clears a lot of this up and is pretty specific about what vitamins, minerals, whole foods and nutrients we should be nourishing our body with. All in all this is a great book on the science of food.  Now, for the bad part. I actually finished this book over a weekend, sick in bed, about a month ago. I was 'sick of being sick' as some would say and devoured (pardon the pun) this wealth of knowledge. After I was well enough to get back to my routine, I threw away almost every single food item in my kitchen, as almost nothing adhered to the optimum plan. I was still very motivated with my bare cupboards and then set out to turn my family's life around.   Dr. Weil makes it pretty clear that you are going to pretty much have to go exclusively organic, bar a few, and I mean few, fruits and vegetables. He even states that some non-organic fruits and vegetables are so toxic in their non-organic state you should never consume them - strawberries for example. Something Weil will also state is the pesca-ovo-vegetarianism diet is his diet of choice, because almost all meats are riddled with hormones that greatly impact our own bodies. The optimum food pyramid doesn't really include animal proteins, so if you aren't a vegetarian, you'll have some serious issues to resolve.  He tells you he loves food, and feels anyone who misses the point and stops enjoying food is wasting their time. I totally agree, but in practice, this book does just about that. Demonizing foods based on the fears of cancer and inflammatory disease can be a difficult pill to swallow, particularly if you've consumed these foods all of your life. The nature of label reading and being a smart consumer can literally drive you insane. It's certainly beneficial, we know that, but making it a lifestyle will require more then just a bit of education.  This book also is not for anyone seeking weight-loss through diet modification. Weil explains it certainly can be done, but he spends more time telling you what diets, such as Atkins, not to partake in. This fact is actually not a negative side to the book. However given the nations statistics on obesity I think this could have been a more helpful aspect of the book if he developed it.  I will end with this: This book could/would be an incredible useful tool if you were any or (ideally all) of the following:  1. You are wealthy. Try buying exclusively organic. It's outrageous. Most working families can not afford this lifestyle, contrary to the notion that prepared and processed foods are expensive. Prepared and process foods are cheap - that's why Americans consume them at such high rates. He suggest to organic co-op farms, but even as late as 2006 they can be scarce for most people in the suburbs, and when you do find them, they will only be cheaper then buying organic from natural food stores and chains, which isn't saying much. Don't be shocked when you find vine-ripened organic tomatoes at $5.99 a pound.  2. You do not work. Almost exclusively cooking from scratch, which is even acknowledged by Weil, will be the hardest transition for anyone who works full-time or has a family. This is probably the saddest aspect of this book. There certainly is nothing wrong with from cooking wholesome, healthy meals from scratch - but it isn't the norm for most people. If you buy the foods recommended, you'll be spending about 70% of your day in the kitchen if preparing 3 meals.   3. You already lead a healthful and active lifestyle. If this is you then you probably already knew much of Weil's intuitive advice and therefore will need only tweaking to adhere to the optimum plan.  My personal experience with this book is that you can back yourself into a corner with fear. If you work and have a family I suggest you skip this book. Working in your 5+ a day fruits and vegetables, organic or not, and leading an active lifestyle is a good place to start. The Eating For Optimum Health book creates a pretty black and white picture. And we all know life isn't black and white.   
 I fear I must disagree with those readers who have given this one a thunderous ovation.  What time in history could be more fascinating, full of action and suspense than the French Revolution? With this riveting background, how could this book fail to captivate and engross?  Mantel shows us how.  Getting through this overblown tome was an exercise in discipline and tedium.  I kept waiting to be caught up in the action, but never was.  Despite being populated by the proverbial cast of thousands, none of them seemed particularly interesting.  These are the pivotal figures in a great historical movement, yet I found them lackluster, irksome and confusing in temperament.  Most of the peak moments of the Revolution take place "off camera," as it were.  We get one paragraph about the executions of Louis XVI and Marie-Antonette, the murder of Marat, and the storming of the Bastille.  What was surely a fascinating and fast-moving time in history is bogged down here by endless colloquy between the principals.  After 800 pages of listening to them blab, I still did not get much of a feel for who they were and what motivated them.  Could these men have been as cynical, self-serving and puerile as they appear?  Camille Desmoulins comes off as an obnoxious adolescent; all I felt I knew about Danton pertained to his scarred face and sexual appetites; and Robespierre - who must have been a powerful and charismatic person - seems no better than a bore and a prig.  How could individuals such as these have galvanized the nation into a total overthrow of an ancient regime?  This book would have been greatly improved by some incisive editing, for starters.  I consider myself an educated and fairly savvy reader, but this one left me cold.  Perhaps better suited to those who are already well-informed about the French Revolution than for those who are reading to be enlightened 
 Last march (2002) i bought this camera and it was wonderful, although it was "refurbished" by CANON it worked perfectly. I bought also a new battery and a 48MB Compactflash memory card and everything was working fine. 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired. Now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for "refurbished" items is less than 6 months 
 I love the Scarpetta books, but I had to force myself to finish this one.  The plot was disjointed, and the use of the English language was atrocious.  I can't believe she published this.  It is absolutely not up to par.  If you're going to waste your time on this book, get it from a library so you don't waste your money as well 
 here's a case of a someone trying to capitalize of someone's good name. don't buy this if you care about fair artist treatment 
 Wow.  I thought because OK Computer was such a good album this book would probably be pretty good.   But then I read it.  The writing is so stale and unemotional that the author is unable to actually articulate what the album means to anyone.  Instead, she uses chords and stupid bpm graphs to talk about the songs and othing about their emotional weight.  Plain and simple, This book SUCKED don't waste your money on it.  Buy the one on Let it Be by the Replacemnts instead 
 Don't let the title fool you as it did me.  For whatever reason, I led myself to believe the whole movie took place on a train in the same fashion Rear Window takes place all within one location.  It doesn't, but part of me wished it had.  As far as the plot goes, two strangers meet on a train.  Guy, a pro tennis star, and Bruno, a psychotic socialite.  He proposes to Guy that they both help each other, with Bruno murdering Guy's cheating wife, and in return Guy killing Bruno's father.  Part of this felt very Throw Mama From the Train to me, but more funny.  Anyway, I have come to expect great things, and high tension from Hitchcock, and sorry to say, he didn't deliver this time around.  The best part of this movie is Robert Walker's portrayal of Bruno, who seems friendly and normal, but just by listening to him talk for more than a couple minutes, you get the feeling he is as far from normal as you can get.  His performance reminded me eerily of Kevin Spacey.  If they were to remake this movie (and as much as I despise remakes, I believe they are planning one), they'd be foolish not to offer it to him.  So for what it's worth, Hitchcock is still the master, but don't let this be your introduction to him if you're new to his body of work, there are many superior choices 
 At first I was very intrigued by this author and his narrative.  The story seemed to have a lot to offer.  But the problem we all have when reading spiritual books is how to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Someone who had done their homework, could undoubtedly, read the literature and put together their own book.  What really separates true experiences from imagination?  And what good is imagination in achieving greater a spiritual connection with the universe?  For me, the deciding factor is, whether or not the work speaks to me.  I set the book down for a few days and meditated on the contents.  As I reviewed the book and it's themes, I am sorry to say, I think it is more likely a scientific reduction of the shamanic experience to an agenda of fighting global warming 
 I bought three of these -- one for myself and one for each pair of grandparents.  Two of them stopped working.  One of the two had tons of bad pixels and the other one just stopped.  Unfortunately, out of the warranty period!  And inquiry to the manufacturer has been ignored.  I'm out a lot of money for this garbage.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GARBAGE!!!! 
 This camera is a waste of money and should be taken off the market.  After purchase we were never able to retreive pictures.  The computer would recognize the camera but stated that no pictures were available to download.  It not only is difficult to use but not even an adult could figure out how to take a picture and this product is made for a child.  The instructions are complicated and eventually you give up.  Even putting in the batteries is complicated and you need a screwdriver (the smallest one you can find) to achieve it.  Unfortunately, I have wasted my money but luckily you don't have to 
 It's hard to tell just what the point if any this movie was trying to make. There are scenes which contain cheap disjointed porn and then moral comments  This "film" really was a waste of money and at best should be rented and not bough 
 Author Kevin Murphy, of course, was a writer/performer on the cult TV hit, "Mystery Science Theater 3000." As such, you'd think he'd have the sort of insight and humor that would make this book a great read for movie fans.  Unfortunately, though, Murphy spends most of his Year whining about contemporary moviegoing. Okay, so we know that multiplexes suck. We know that theater food is both bad and overpriced. We know that most modern movies suck, too. Murphy is right to point these things out, but he dwells on them page after page with little of the wit one might expect. And in his eagerness to knock even the better aspects of American cinema (dissing both "Pulp Fiction" and Jerry Lewis, for instance) while singing the praises of the most obscure of foreign documentaries, Murphy comes off as more movie snob than movie fan. To top it all off, there's an air of political correctness in much of Murphy's writing that turns up the smug factor. This was a great idea for a book, but it's neither as funny as you want it to be nor as definitive a comment on the current state of cinema as Murphy may have wanted it to be. A disappointment. 
 Book is out of date with modern economic thought.  Essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets. 
 Maybe films should be made by film makers 
 This novel is neither a love story nor a story about Titanic. Don't be misled if that's why you want to read this story. What it is, is the tale of a 12 year old boy struggling with the confusing and conflicting feelings which the onset of puberty brings. Unfortunately, this is a poor choice of narrator for a tale of the tragic ship. Sumner Jordan, is so wrapped up in his own feelings and fantasy love story, the object of his affection is a 21 year-old suffragist, that he is neither observant about his surroundings, nor perceptive about the feelings of the famous and fictional characters he meets. Worse, he complains about everything. So much so that when he is going through his crises, instead of feeling sympathy, you just wish he'd deal with it and keep quiet. Sumner is also hard to believe as a 12 year-old boy. Especially at the beginning of the book, the voice is more that of a girl.  A major problem with the story is the lack of character development. You never get to know enough about any of the characters to really care about their fates. During the sinking, the life and death decisions are made so quickly, little suspense is generated. If you collect Titanic literature, by all means, add this to your collection. If you are looking for greater insight into the disaster, look somewhere else 
 I read this book with absolutely no knowledge of Barna, his revolution, or any biases in relation to it.  I would like to make the comment that this book is seriously flawed in the superficial and short-sightedness that it demonstrates.    Thankfully, the author does not claim to have pulled any of his data that he uses to support his theory from anywhere other than the American churches.  However, he then uses it to apply to the Church, which is global in nature, and that is the book's serious flaw.  It is short-sighted in that he does not seem to apply anything about the global Church and local churches to his theories other than what is happening, according to his observations, in the US.  While there may be some value to these insights, I resent that he is equating what he observes in American churches as what is happening and will happen in the global Church.    I'd like to see him ask the question why while American churches, in his opinion, are failing, are so many churches globally flowering and prospering?  What makes him think that American churches, which make up a MINORITY of all churches worldwide, should be the sole trendsetter.  From the perspective of what is presented in this book, it seems the author is living in a bubble and is making a superficial and overly generalized prediction for the Church.      Sure, this book is easy to read and understand.  Sadly, I believe it is actually the poorer for these qualities.  If it weren't, I could at least try to believe that his writing is not as superficial as it is.  
 The Mac OS, $129 list, often cheaper, doesn't get viruses, worms, malware, etc and probably runs all the software you do on a PC, with the exception of some games. Go to a Mac Store and try it for yourself 
 I read the Subjection of Women for my 17th Century Philosophy class.  I found it interesting, but hard to read.  Mill tends to be repetative and wordy.  He is very much the early feminist until you get to page 86 or 87 when he tells you that for all women can do, they should stay home and care for the family anyway.  I would suggest that others read this book, but give yourself time, because about 20 pages a night was all that I could muster.  At 100 pages it's not too long, but could have been said with more clarity and organization 
 I fell in love I guess with the radio edits. When the CD came out and I purchased it, I blindly thought this was what I would be getting. But to my surprise, I ended up getting quite a bit of RAP mixed in with the songs that to me completely ruined them all.  I threw the CD in the trash, and have learned my lesson with purchasing any future PCD audio 
 I thought this would be a great first book for my son since it is a "classic" and all, but the hardbook edition isn't all that fun for baby. Each page has something that the baby can see and touch i.e. he/she can actually "pat the bunny" and feel a sonft, furry bunny. Some pages are just too harsh, for example one page says baby can feel daddy's stubble or something like that, and there's a picture of a man shaving with a piece of sandpaper on his cheek! Needless to say, that page is too harsh for baby's soft skin and he didn't really like that. Other pages tell baby to put his/her finger inside a hole and do some other activities which are just bland. And the colors throughout the book are rather pale. Baby likes a lot of his other books with more mirrors and colors, and books that are soft so he can eat them 
 This is so far one of the most boring Nora Roberts books, ever.  It was OK but it seriously was a PUSH to get through it, and usually I simply just fly through her novels.  The characters are very flat and uninvolved.  I was able to guess whodunit way before the act was even done, as well as guess some of the plot twists.  The book was fun for the trip to Hollywood-land but besides that it was a LONG book (528 pages) that really would have been better off slimmed down.  Lots ado about nothing which leads to boring repeat events and pointless happenings that in the end you discover served no purpose at all to the story.  If you are a NR fan, you may like it but I suggest perhaps finding another novel to read first and borrow this one from a friend.  
 The book is obsolete. Not much info, for a current graduate of computer science or ee or computer engineering. Samples and techniques are obsolete.  Waste of money. don't buy. Probably good for old managers who are not  familiar with embedded system 
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 The author cites the evolutionary and empirical evidence of modern day science and presents a convincing picture for justification of God, then completely deviates from reason and fact and concludes that science is a type of mythology - that we know nothing.  It was a boring read but I hoped for a climatic or at least informative ending...neither manifested.  
 I have to agree with all the other reviewers who found so much promise in the premise and in the first few chapters of this book. About 1/4 of the way through it, I really loved it and even recommended it to others. The idea of Mary visiting an ordinary woman seemed so mystical and warm at the same time. But halfway through it I've started to skim pages; at the third "History" chapter, I groaned out loud. The two separate stories in this book - a visit from Mary and an exploration into philosophy and theology - weren't blended well enough for me to continue to feel excited about this book. I'll do my best to finish it, but I'm already disappointed 
 This book is an interesting combination of fairly good writing and fairly poor science. The information on which the author draws is taken out of its context, so while his conclusions have an internal logic, that logic is far-fetched and has almost no bearing on the rest of the world. But the author's writing is good enough to keep this from being self-evident. I found the book an easy but worthless read 
 Beware, that this DVD does not have English audio track despite its Amazon description. This is an outstanding movie, but Amazon has wrong data and issued a full refund for me 
 The authors mistakenly believe the reader would be interested in ad nauseum details of their personal partying!  Nothing new or inspired in this tiny book 
 I've been a great fan of Nanci Griffith, but this is not her best effort.  The songs are dull, don't stand out and all sound pretty much like studio work.  She can do so much better.  I wonder if the other good reviews where just loyaty to Nanci Griffith.  Besides inartistic song writing, what happened to her voice.  It went from a unique sound to mediocre run of the mill.  There is nothing to remember about this CD - she must have just been meeting contract obligations 
 This was a nice, fast read and kept me awake during my commute but in NO way should be compared to Amy Tan.  I found the cliches and overly descriptive scenarios very dull and annoying.  Seemed to me that the author was trying too hard (as if overboard description makes for good writing).    The character of Lindsey was shallow and ran away from anything remotely unsafe.  She annoyed me also.  I found the characters of Pau Pau and Michael were most endearing, though.    I bought both "The Dim Sum of All Things" and "Buddha Baby" at the same time.  "Buddha Baby" was very similar to "Dim Sum" and annoyed me for the exact same reasons.  
 It's hard for me to write a review, because I only read half the book.  It was so poorly written that once I put it down, I never could pick it up again.  If your kids are bad, make them read this book as torture.  It's the only use I could find for the book.  
 This book may be challenging for infants, but for my intelligence, i found the game boring 
 I like Jonathan Anton & some of his products, but this one was a very bad one.  It smelled like swamp water.  His other products smell great.  I don't know what happened to this one.  
 I purchased this software thinking that I could take my digital images, create a slide show with music, and then burn it to dvd for the family to watch. Unfortunately, the disk that I got gave me some error messages that when I called tech support (one hour hold time)they told me that my error message meant that I could create files, but they'll only run on my computer, not on my tv dvd player. In addition, you need to buy additional dvd burning software, because the dvd burning software imbedded in this software package will only create dvds that will run on a dvd player with the Microsoft logo on them. (The package says the dvds will run on almost any dvd player) So I asked for my money back. However, since it took me more than 30 days to find all of this out, they refused a refund. 
 It seems like Hard Core Logo is an example of a book that was not quiet as good as the film that was made out of it.  Perhaps I expected too much upon seeing the excellent film first, but I can't help but be disappointed with  the book.  It's novel in verse format is clever, although skimpy.  I feel  that Turner had a great story to tell, but left out all the best parts.   The characters are underdeveloped and the whole story feels empty and  unfulfilling.  It is a very short book (it took me about three times as  long to watch the movie than read the book), and while this is not  necessarily a bad thing, I felt that there had to be more in this book to  make it work.  A great idea, a great basis for a movie, this book is a bit  too hollow to be thoroughly enjoyed.  Check out American Whisky bar  instead, it's way better and a great book in itself 
 The premise for this book seems as though it could make an interesting story.  Unfortunately, this is not well developed. The story seems to touch lightly on dozens of things and doesn't have any depth or feeling to it 
 This novel was a selection of my book club and as such it was a letdown. While you could classify the book as a "good read," so is a lot of mass market fiction. The characters are not well developed, and the author doesn't portray them subtly or fully enough for you to care about them. The plot as well as the writing is cliche-ridden, and the ending is pat. It is clear early on that the sisters will mend their relationship, find true love, and all will work out in the end. If you are looking for a recent, well-written book about sisters with more interesting plots and characterization, and a nice dose of humor, try Case Histories by Kate Atkinson or Rise and Shine by Anna Quindlen. A second-tier Anna Quindlen book is sharp, funny, and better written than most premiere efforts by other writers 
 takes "Armis virumque" and gets "I sing of warfare and a man at war"?  The consensus in the reviews is that Fitzgerald has written a fine epic.  It just is not the same one written by Virgil.  If you want to read Fitzgerald, this is the book for you.  If you want to read Virgil you need the Mandelbaum translation 
 This cd is another dissapointment, just like Fixed.  I am a really big fan of NIN and they let me down 2 times now! It doesn't even have the original version of it on here, and even the remix by NIN is crap.  I would save your money, and go for the We're In This Together Part 3 single, because it has it in ther 
 I have tried the AOL's cd that gives free connection for 3 months, and when I wanted to cancel the subscription (because I changed my home address) it was impossible to stop the bank tranfers. As incredible as this may sound, AOL claims that they cannot cancel my subscription because I don't remember my password. Even when I am able to confirm all other information (credit card number, date of birth, social, etc), they refuse the cancel the subscription. When I talked to my bank, the bank clerk told me that many people have had the same problems with AOL. I have met dozens of people in my University that faced very similar problems with AOL. AOL has a very bad approach to business and found a easy and certain way of losing customers 
 I'm a huge u2 fan but maybe I'm the only one on this world who doesn't like r.e.m. very much.I find songs like drive,everybody hurts and man on the moon(one of my favourite)very beautiful.But the other songs are boring and ripetitive.I don't know why people say that this is one of the best album in music.I hope one day I'll understand this band.. 
 If you must see a cannibal film stick to Cannibal Holocaust. the grindhouse release is well worth the money. However the grindhouse release of ferox is just awful. The picture quality is horrendous. The movie is lacking any redeemable quality. There are a few violent moments, but just a few. One of the absolute worst italian horror/exploitation films made. If Cannibal Holocaust is the citizen kane of cannibal films, then ferox is the plan 9. 
 I bought the Hardcover Boxed edition published October, 1988, by Houghton Mifflin Co (Trd); ISBN: 0395489326 -- and I have to say that this edition is a disgrace.  The books are hardcovered with brown cloth and are protected by a tannish yellow cover, each with different artwork by Alan Lee.    This edition is horrible because the ink and printing is NOT really well-done.  There are hard-to-read words, smears, blotches, etc.  The paper quality is grain and has a tint of yellow in it - not recommended for white-white paper book readers.  Each book has a "Middle-Earth" foldout map at the end of the book.  These maps are terribly glued on to the back flap and are stuck close to the binding.  If you try to take the maps out, which is intended to be taken out to hang on the wall, the brown flap paper will stick and tear along with the folded map.  J.R.R. Tolkein's trilogy of the Lord of the Rings is a true masterpiece, but keeping a set that I will read over and over needs to be well-made. I do not recommend this 1988 edition because of the quality that Houghtin Mifflin printed and bounded.  The artwork covers are beautifully done and well-designed.  Everything else is fair game 
 The information given in the book is very shallow and most of the book consists of lists of essential oil suppliers. Some of the phone numbers are incorrect. I would NOT recommend this book 
 I have several visions pieces.  I only keep them because they are handy to use in the microwave; on the stove the only thing they are good for is boiling water.  They heat VERY unevenly and develop terrible hotspots.  If you drop them or the lid you stand a fair chance of shattering it.  The fact that they are transparent has never been useful to me 
 I have three highly gifted children. None of them are interested in reading this book 
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
 This is an ok book for new people, but it has several safty issues, and doesn't have the show cuts for many dogs, poodles. It also has the wrong cuts from some of the dogs. There are better books out there 
 Not one of Krentz's entertaining books.  I usually enjoy her stories immensely; however this one was not funny but rather depressing.  Phila seemed to me to be too opinionated in her views and unable to deal with  those of opposing views.  The characters were not portrayed as likable  individuals and made the storyline unbelievable.  The attraction between  Phila and Nick did seem genuine, but her dislike of the families and all  they stood for to her seemed too insurmountable an obstical for her to have  really overcome. Unfortunately I just didn't get any enjoyment from this  particular story 
 Another farce to feed irrational hatred with authoritative sounding documentation... If you dig that sort of thing... there are tons out on the market...Unfortunately they don't come with disclaimers. like one would get when reading a book on the occult... People tend to go for books that support their bigoted view, and this is a fine example... it is a lucrative business in the united states to see what is en vogue and write a book of it.... It is a living. When the Da Vinci code was written it was a craze everyone had to write the idiot's guide to the code, how to interpret the code etc etc.... I am not surprised of a book like this and certainly there is no accounting for integrity or lack thereof... people write for years even for the NY times before others discover their plagiarism.... or in this case the secret agenda.... before long we will all be drafted to support capitalistic oligarchies err democracy abroad... 
 This is a must read book. Dr. Franklyn is the best writer ever. He deserves the respect of the entire world 
 Whats the song called and who is it sung by when Brian pulls up to the cafe where mia works, its like a little italian/ spanish love song, plz plz tell me i love it an cant find it 
 The descriptions don't mention the creepy voice that says "It's lullabye time" before it launches into an seriously off-key rendition of Twinkle Twinkle Firefly (huh? was there a copyright problem with using "little star"?) You can press the moon button to skip the first song, so I didn't have too much trouble with this- most of the songs after the first are mercifully without vocals. Later on this same Robo-Mom also says "I love you", which is seriously spooky. Aside from this, the "amazing 3-D ceiling light" is really more of a rotating circular slide projection of some cartoon animals, and the bee-and- LED light show on the actual toy looks really old-fashioned. The nature sounds are ok, but I am pretty sure one of the sounds is "plank of wood tapping against another plank of wood".   Even with all of this, I was still willing to strap it to my son's crib and see how he liked it- and within the first five minutes the projector light flickered on and off, and the Robo-Mom got stuck and kept saying "It's lullabye time" over and over. 
 The high praise heaped on this is by people who have never actually read anything by George Orwell ( OR Francis Schaeffer, or Theodore Dalrymple or even John Mortimer -for the loyal opposition)-Trite, smug and arrogant opinions that warm themselves by the fires of this anti intellectual screed should have the honesty to read Paleo Conservative journals like AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE to see that discontent with neocon foreign policy ( that went on for a FULL 8 years under Clinton as well) is challenged by BOTH those on the left AND the right.It is the lack of intellectual analysis and clarity that has created our current crisis. TRY reading "HOW SHALL WE THEN LIVE?" by SCHAEFFER or DALRYMPLE's "OUR CULTURE ,WHAT's  LEFT of IT" for a more intelligent and cogent analysis 
 The only reason I'm reviewing this movie now is because I just watched it on TV today. And the only reason I watched it was because nothing else was on. So...  No, let's be fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though, because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was proven right.  Analyze That illustrates perfectly why `sequel' sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that is why they fail time after time.  So what does this movie have? A great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and? Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that. A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile on several occasions. But that isn't enough. There are thousands of comedy films out there; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable, and producers think they'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas. Newsflash: think again. Nobody watches these movies. There's no reason to when you can just watch the original again 
 The collapse of France in 1940 was the last in the chain of political and military defeats. First it was lost "the battle of Czechoslovakia" (politicaly) and then the campaign in Poland. Unfortunately, the author don't give a fair evaluation of this events. On the contrary. He quoted Marshall Petain (and agree with him), who after the disaster in 1940 maintained that one of the reasons of the collapse were "too few allies". Sorry, but the reality was completely "the other way round". It were French, who let down first Czechoslovakia in Munich and then, one year later, Poland 
 I'm very dissappointed with this expensive pump. Now I'm looking for another one. It's difficult to pump if you have large nipples. You have to buy extra sheild which costs extra. It's noisy. It loses suction.The milk backs up to the tubing and gets moldy.I clean the parts everyday. I have contacted Medela a few times to troubleshoot the pump and they eventually sent me another motor (great customer service). It worked for a few months and now the same problem is happening. I guess it works for some and not others. Now I'm in the hunt for another pump since I want to exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk for her first year.  
 I tried 3 of these DVD+Rs, none of them worked, errors in every burn. I used another brand to burn the session and it worked perfectly, so it is definately a problem with these DVD+Rs and not with my burner 
 This book has Greek bias toward ancient Iranian history. This book is lacking balance view toward ancient Iranian historical figures 
 I have to say that this book was well written, and did have its exciting points. I have never really been a Kitiara fan from the start. When I read the chronicles I never really liked reading about here, but I am on a mission to read all of the dragonlance books. I have to say that every book I read about Kitiara, whether it is "steel and stone", or this book...my opinion of Kitiara drops very low. I know she is an "evil" person, but her character is a disgrace to all women, and she makes me sick when I read about her. Don't get me wrong, the book is written well, and does have its points, but Kitiara is a sickening character, and whenever I read about her I want to close the book 
 Well I can say the book is ok. However, I do feel like this book is more about them trying to sell their services to me than to teach or explain Lean Six Sigma... If I wanted to buy consulting or training services I would rather not have it shoved down my throat in a book.  
 I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this product. Indeed it does not work on my WinXP PC. The program will not even open and run. The Magellangps.com site has a downloadable patch for the product but it did not work either. What a waste of time and money. If Magellan ever answers my support requests, I hope they will send me a working copy of the program. 
 I bought this becuse it got a great review in the Village Voice and now seeing that the author lives in Brooklyn he must know the reviewer and got a gift from him.  Anyway I read close to a hundred pages hoping it would get better and reaized that it was a complete waste of my time 
 I've read numerous books on John Lennon and this ranks among the worst. It is just another cash-in rip-off in the line of Albert Goldman, Fred Seaman  etc. Green wants to convince the reader he had a very close relationship  with Lennon, could see inside his head, and pretends to remember their  discussions accurately, word by word. He depicts Lennon and Ono as  completely unbalanced, insecure, restless, child-like characters who never  knew what they really wanted. And of course, the tarot-card reader Green  was always there to give wise, fatherly advice so that those two poor  creatures wouldn't have messed up their lives completely. If you really  want to understand Lennon to the extent it is possible, I suggest you read  Anthony Elliott's excellent psychological analysis "The Mourning of  John Lennon" 
 While it is understandable that every histrical account, treatise or even research based on available historical data  tends to get subjective, it is hardly an excuse when blatant personal biases come through in a text book written by a so called scholar.  Murphey's version of "A History of Asia" is the text book assigned for my otherwise wonderful Asian Studies class.  Let me quote some examples from the sixth edition:(pp110 para 6) "Plunder and slaughter in the name of God did not make a good impression for Islam on most Indians, but the austere new religion with its offer of certanity and equality of all did apeal to some, as wherever it spread to other countries." So what is the author saying?? He is talking about Mahmud of Ghazni whose "remote mountain ringed capital became a great center of Islamic Culture, thanks in part to stolen Indian riches." So, is he saying that Islam brought equality and justice to India, or is he saying that Islam brought plunder and brutalty to the region, or is it his own bias showing through?  It is also interesting to note that when finding a passage to quote from the Quran, as opposed to the ones he picks to quote from other scriptures, he chooses the now fashionable-to-quote: "Fight in the name of God against those who fight against you, but do not commit aggression..." is this all that Islam represents to the learned professor that he wants to pass on to his audience? Did he care to mention the context in which those verses were said and written? Did he know that that the first thirteen years of Islam, Muslims were forbidden to fight back even in the face of violent persecution, the kind known only to the Arabian desert of 1500 years ago? Lets move on... When talking about the most important event of Islam, the Hijrah (pp 36) or the migration of the Prophet from Makkah to Madinah, Murphey says: "When preaching against these evils attracted few supporters, he (Mohammad) moved to Medina..." Really?? was that the reason for the Hijira? In actuality, the persecution of Muslims had increased to the level where they were being systematically killed by Arab pagans and Muhammad himself was the target of assasination attempts, it is in the light of those events that Muslims belive he was ordered to migrate to Medina by God. Murphey futher goes on to say that the the migration is used to mark the first year of the Muslim era, known as the "year of the prophet" Please!! It is known as "Hijri" or the "year of the migration." Further references to Islam are too blatantly biased to pass off as mere ignorance "or not one of Dr. Murpheys area of expertise" as some would like to discount.  Let me quote here for example: "Women have an explicitly inferior status, can be set aside at will by their husbands, must cover their bodies (my comment: the favorite of those who cannot tolerate seeing women in anything but bikinis, of course), and face outside their own domestic quarters (to which they are largely confined), and are subject to their fathers, brothers, and husbands in all things. The Koran also sanctions holy war (jihad)....." and it goes on. Which culture is Murphey trying to describe here? some backward desert tribe in a so-called Islamic state or that prescribed by Islam itself? I would definitely be interested in knowing the sources he has used to arrive at these statements. By the way, the word "Jihad" does not translate to "Holy War", in fact, there is no word or phrase in the Arabic language that translates to this remnant phrase from the Crusades. "Jihad" merely means "Struggle"  The fact is that in a society that practiced female infanticide and left hundreds of women widowed and cast out from being  respectable members of the society due to tribal wars that waged for years, Islam brought rights and respect to women. It allowed the widowed women to be married respectably rather than be abused mistresses to already married men, it allowed women to vote and to make important decisions in the community, it dispelled the practice of depriving women of the right of posessing property, and the limitation of their right of transaction, it cancelled the practice of husbands despotism in the property of their wives, in short, among many other social and individual benefits, Islam guaranteed rights to to women  fifteen hundred years ago that modern western civilizations had not been able to guarantee till a few decades ago.  I would give this book a zero star if the option existed. How can I read the rest of the book without knowing that it is not tainted with the authors biases, ignorance and prejudice. Not knowing if this so called account of Asian History is accurate, I would refrain from recommending it as a text book 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 This book is not very well suited to those who want an introduction to health policy and services.  If you have some background in the field, it will probably be too basic to help you very much.  I had no such background when I began using this book in a graduate course in health policy, and while most of the text is understandable, it is generally not very interesting and/or helpful.  I suppose it's a good thing that the book and chapters are brief, however it leaves out a lot of details that I felt would be beneficial towards understanding a very complex system.  When statistics are used to exemplify a point, they are generally pretty dated.  Even if a new edition were available though, I'd read through a chapter or two in the library before investing in this book 
 "Return of the Living Dead: Rave to the Grave" (2005) is, in short, not scary nor funny, another disaster in this series. I thought "Return of the Living Dead: Necropolis" (2005) was so awful, enough terrible to become the nail in the series' coffin, but I was wrong. They made another sequel which is worse than the previous "ROTLD." Considering the badness of `Necropolis,' this is kind of amazing.  Actually "Necropolis" and "Rave to the Grave" (the fourth and fifth entries in `Return of the Living Dead' series) were shot back to back in Romania. Director for both films is Ellory Elkayem (`Eight Legged Freaks"), and `Rave to the Grave" features some of the stars of `Necropolis' including Peter Coyote, Aimee-Lynn Chadwick, Cory Hardrict and John Keefe.  `Rave to the Grave' is about the high school students who survived the terrible zombie outbreak in the previous film. They are now college students and this time one of them finds a dusty canister in the attic, but instead of leaving it alone or reporting to the police, he and his friends take a sample of the slimy liquid inside and bring it to the laboratory in the campus. And ... here is the silliest part ... one student makes a drug called `Z' out of the sample and starts to sell it on campus.  `Rave to the Grave" relies on this silly one-joke idea about the zombie drug that not only makes people act like zombies, but actually turns them into real ones. The film runs out of steam halfway through the story, and the rest of it is about the repetitious battles between zombies and humans that are neither thrilling nor funny to see. Two `Men-in-Black'-like hitmen are added to the humorless story of teenager zombie attack, but their downbeat humor does not work with the weak and pointless direction that fails to make the entire film a real gorefest or campy fun.  The only good thing about the film is you can see Tarman Zombie, but only briefly. Except for one mildly amusing scene, he has nothing to do in the film. He appears and stays out of the film most of the time. This is definitely the worst film in the `Return of the Living Dead' series, and probably nearly as bad as the notorious "House of the Dead. 
 This guy is a serious jerk.  Don't buy this book and support his cause -- which is anti-everything-decent.  Buy Al Franken's book on him instead -- much more accurate and interesting 
 I found this to be an interesting and frustrating book. Dalton is a decent, though self-indulgent writer, who is able to create good narrative momentum. He has some interesting if not very deep things to say about race and class and childhood. But everything positive about the book was deeply undermined for me because it contains a great deal of factual error and distortion. I know this because my family figures prominently in his story. He was my brother's best friend during a critical period of their childhoods, which Dalton recounts at considerable length. And much of what he says is simply wrong. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he wrote things as he remembers them and did not deliberately embellish the story. But the inaccuracies are significant because they pertain to the very heart of what he is trying to say. When Dalton transferred to PS41, he moved into a very different socioeconomic sphere, and the contrast between his earlier experiences and the new world he entered affected him deeply. Those contrasts--and the meanings he draws from them--are a great deal of what he tries to make sense of in the book. And that is what makes his inaccuracies so troubling. The portrait he paints of my family is of an extremely privileged, wealthy clan of economic and cultural elitists. That makes a better story, but it is also false. It makes me wonder just how accurate his other memories are. Is what he says about other people, places, and experiences as distorted as what he says about my family? His book is a clear lesson in just how subjective and unreliable memoirs are as sources of information about anything or anyone other than their authors. If you read this book, you'll know what Dalton thinks his childhood was like. No more, no less 
 I ordered the Colby CX-CD241 portable CD player for my 8 year old nephew -- along with a CD - for his birthday.  When it arrived, the AM/FM Radio worked, but the CD player did not. This unit was obviously not tested prior to its release.  My nephew was so upset that he wasn't able to listen to the CD he has been asking for. Talk about a terrible birthday gift!  What a tease.  I would have been better off not buying anything at all than "half a gift" that was of no use to him.  In the meantime, I'm still waiting for Amazon to send a label so I can return this piece of crap.  I will never buy anything branded Colby in the future.    Amazon -- Unfortunately, I'm associating you with your affiliation to Colby.  You would be better off dropping their products.  Don't let them drag you down with them. 
 The oral history approach by Ambrose & Co offers certainly has its attraction. And if this book would have consisted of personal accounts of D-Day veterans only, I think it would have made a valuable, insightful, and memorable account of this landmark battle.   Unfortunately, the author did not leave it at that but felt the need to present his own, highly biased and overly patriottic views on the various aspects of the battle. The message that is spelled out again and again, in capitals, is that only the American troops and their commanders showed excellence in planning and carrying out the battle. Their allies, in particular the British, receive considerably less credit or even scorn. For example, the book ridicules the supposed British craze for "gadgets", such as their mini-submarines and special tanks, which they nonetheless used very effectively on D-day.   But what really annoys me is the personal "battle" that Ambrose seems to be fighting with the long-beaten German foe: all the decisions they took on D-day were wrong in his opinion, they responded way too late or not at all, they failed to foresee the invasion, their command structure was inadequate, their navy did not intercept the fleet "which nobody could understand", etc. etc. The truth is that by june 1944 the Germans simply did not have the resources to fight an agressive and intelligent counter-battle on the Western front anymore. I find it disappointing, a little cheap and certainly inappropriate for a scholarly historian to keep on criticizing the past performance of an enemy with the comforts of hindsight and imaginary resources. (Even more so as the included number of German combattants' accounts in this book is less than a handful.)   By the end of this book, I was thoroughly fed up with the hollow rhetorics and "easy" truths like "The Wehrmacht's many mistakes [on D-day] were exceeded by those of the Luftwaffe, which was quite simply just not there" (ch 32). Perhaps this style is what it takes to write a bestseller, but "D Day: June 6, 1944" fails as a military history book. 
 Barber's trenchant jargon updates slogans for class-warfare and utopian proletarian dictatorships. The rhetoric relies on emotion to bridge logical leaps, hides a distain for cause and effect relationships and sidesteps questions about human nature.  Instead, Barber carelessly brews a mix of hip buzzwords and mass marketing clich. If you read this tome, be prepared for endless repetition of 'the capitalist is dangerous, but united the people cannot be defeated':  Repeat the following 5 or 10 times and you have the book in a nutshell: "Jihad pursues a bloody politics of identity, McWorld a bloodless economics of profit. Belonging by default to McWorld, everyone is a consumer; seeking a repository for identity everyone belongs to some tribe. But no one is a citizen. Without citizens, how can there be ..." {fill in the blank with any utopian quality: justice, happiness, equality, etc.}  The central problem for 21st century Marxists is updating the logic of class struggle.  In the first half of the 19th century Marx taught a strict evolutionary progression from noble-savage to slavery, from slavery to feudalism, and from feudalism to capitalism.  Within a few years, Marx predicted, capitalism would collapse and the unavoidable socialist utopia would emerge.  Of course, the collapse didn't happen and Marxist have been rationalizing ever since.  Lenin had to add the Imperialist phase.  21st century Marxist need to show imperialism mutating into  global consumerism.   Towards this end, Barbour argues: 1. Capitalists have shed their 'nationalist' identity, finding it easier to enslave the proletariat via media manipulation. 2. Media manipulation (global consumerism) seeks to replace indigenous cultural identities with slavish loyalty to global products.   3. 'Wild Capitalism' promoting global products causes criminal damage to indigenous communities, and threatens environmental catastrophe.  4. Protecting these indigenous communities (victims) will require violence (socialist revolution).  Hidden beneath this victim-oppressor dualism lies the traditional Marxist faith in central planning or 'government by intellectuals.' Democracy can be dismissed because the 'means of communication' are held by the multinational capitalist elite.  And, Marxist don't need an elections, as intellectuals they already know what is best for everyone else. Thus, Barber spends the second half of the book describing the failures of democracy. Barber asserts that "the epoch on whose threshold we stand -- post communist, postindustrial, post national, yet sectarian, fearful, and bigoted -- is likely also to be terminally post democratic."   Time has not been kind to Barber. His 1995 predictions of post-democratic cultures has failed to materialize.  The 90s were not a decade of American decline.  Despite his attempts to be hip and techno-savvy, he entirely misses the dot com craze and  blogosphere. Further, failed to address the rise of Islamofascism.  He calls commercialism all sham, but relies entirely upon its rhetoric.  Consider the cover photo, why is the girl wearing so much makeup behind a chador?  How is she getting the Pepsi through the chador to here lips? The book has nothing to do with Islam, it is just a marketing sham about marketing shams.  In the end, it sell 'Barber, the hip international intellectual' and little else 
 This is a truly dismal book with a thoroughly misleading title.  It contains some sensible dynamic tension exercises (though there are much better books available) which comprise essentially the first form of Wing Chun, some largely unexplained and irrelevant diagrams purporting to show Chi-meridians, but has very little to say about developing 'Chi Power'. This was a cynical 'money for old rope' publication cashing in on a craze 
 I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world 
 The Southwest Airlines Way offers little applicable business process knowledge.  Instead the author provides a steady diet of amibiguities and generic case studies.  Drucker this is not.  I was particularly interested in the relationship between unions and Southwest management.  What I expected was a discussion on the management side of the economic value added of union involvement and on the rank-and-file side a discussion of the reasons unions were needed in lieu of employee empowerment programs.  What you get is "we're all in this together".  I recommend this only for those readers who know little about the airline's history and seek a basic primer.  Buy it used 
 I took a chance and bought this game used and was disappointed.  The graphics are gorgeous considering the PS2 platform and it's limitations, but the game was poorly designed.  I hate switching between the three characters.  The characters looked cool by the way.  Although there was item and skill upgrades, I didn't like how it was done.  They should have let you control all three characters as a party, instead of that switching out [...]  Fortunately I didn't waste very much of my HARD EARNED money on it. 
 -spoiler alert- I loved the first book in this series, decoy princess.  It was amazing and I couldn't wait for princess at sea.  I fell in love with Duncan's character and found captain Jeck extremely annoying.  When Duncan betrays Tess its awful and it doesnt make any sense.  He sacrificed for her and then says he never loved her.  Then she falls in love with Jeck.  It was horrible, especially sice Duncan was the only fascinating charcter in the whole book.  I will read the sequel but only in the hope that Dawn Cook will make Jeck more appealing and that she will make sense of Duncan's love and betrayel 
 This book is nothing more than an insult to the Irish people. It paints terrible steroeotypes and does nothing else but put down all this Irish. This book should be burned 
 I picked this up on a whim, mostly because of the cute front cover.  However, I ended up disappointed because the character's behavior is so completely unbeleivable.  I'm all for fun and whimsy, but there has to be a backbone of reality.  None of these characters acted like people do in real life.  After a couple of chapters, their antics became annoying to read.  Also, I found the dialogue rather cheesy 
 If you are looking to find out about the IMAP protocol - This book is very good, I bought it to help me install the Cyrus imap server. The book covers the installation of cyrus but it does not cover the prerequisites. I found the hardest part of setting up the Cyrus server was dealing with the software prerequisites, i.e. tcl and cyrus sasl.  If you are interested in learning about the IMAP protocol, this is the book, if you are interested in setting up Cyrus - save your money 
 I was extrememly dissapointed by this novel. I actually found myself rooting for the bad guys when they finally caught the good guy! The plot had potential -- US & Chinese politics, WMDs, a Mideast connection, etc., but the characters are really hard to believe. It seems like the bad guys are everywhere, watching everything, and only the hero is clueless. Narrow escape after narrow escape, the reader isn't inspired by the hero's dedication, instead, you are left stunned by his stupidity.  If you are a Ludlum fan, pass this one up. There are better choices. 
 Uggggh.  This CD is annoying, even to the 3rd graders in the crowd.  The students actually moaned the second time they heard it.  Save your money and avoid this one 
 This perfume deserves negative stars. I was in Macy's when I saw this fragrance on the Dior counter. The bottle is gorgeous, and I really like Hypnotic Poison and Miss Dior Cherie, so I figured I would give this one a try. I really should have smelled directly from the bottle before spraying it on my skin. It is HORRIBLE. White floral scents are generally not my thing, but I can usually tolerate them. This was the worst perfume I ever smelled. It's way too powdery and it smells so cheap. I was stuck with it on my wrist all day and it kept making me sneeze. Disgusting. Not worth the money at all. If you want to buy this scent, I would recommend buying Dove Deodorant Spray instead. It's much cheaper and smells exactly the same. I wonder if it really is the Dove Deodorant but repackaged...hmm.. 
 I read this book, excited to hear someone talking about how pyschology can be used to study more than just dysfunction.  However, as other reviewers have poited out, the author repeats himself unecessarily throughout the book.  He also uses anecdotal evidence almost exclusively--which means most of his conclusions or platitudes with little impact.  The book Authentic Happines by Martin Seligman is a much better place to turn if you're interested in positive psychology 
 This book was a huge disappointment for me.  After reading a lot on the subject of home theaters and acoustics, I got this book to help me "plan my home theater interior".  Unfortunately she doesn't understand what a true home theater is all about.  On p.79 she discusses how to create a "bedroom home theater" and breaks the most important home theater rules. One, she puts the TV in front of the windows and doesn't have a single drape to stop the light from flooding in the room.  Two, she says "white cabinetry that matches the bed in this room makes the room uniform and relaxing" - though it is common HT knowledge that white reflects light and is the #1 error in home theater design (this is a book about Home Theater Design right?)  Dozens of pictures show the center channel sitting on the FLOOR!  No design tips on how to hide the speaker wires anywhere in this book.     In her section on dedicated home theaters, she spends 3/4 of it discussing "Themed rooms" and then says don't design a theme if you think you will tire of it.  Yet in this entire section she never, ever discusses what drapes or acoustic fabrics to cover your walls, let alone how important it is not to have flat walls.  She mentions on p. 111 to avoid a perfect square and then tells you to find a room that is 30% longer than wide, but neglects to tell you that many rectangles are horrible as well and can be just as bad as a square.  There are Internet sites that let you put in your room dimensions and calculate problem areas, but she doesn't reference or write a single word about such things.  She never mentions curved walls, columns, cathedral or vaulted ceilings and how any of these may make for a good or bad home theater room.  She says on p. 110, "regardless of the type of projector you choose, make sure it is capable delivering a 16:9 aspect ratio for watching widescreen movies".  No Krissy, 16:9 is the standard for High Definition Television (HDTV) not movies - true widescreen movies are in the 2.35:1 ratio (and some even greater than that).  Not only did Krissy specify very little about the "design" of a HT, the book annoyed me because it is so full of errors.  She has almost no knowledge of the subject, regardless of her years as editor of Stereophile Guide to A/V, she clearly wrote this book from the tidbits of information she heard during her years as editor, but doesn't have the conceptual knowledge on how to tie it all together.  Last example: P. 24 she says "Don't put speakers in corners.  The sound will bounce off the walls, ceiling, and floor."  This is funny because speakers even several feet from the corner will still reflect sound off the walls, ceiling and floor, but she says nothing about how to properly place your speakers.  Then, the funniest part, is the picture above shows the center speaker about three feet below the plasma TV, when you should always place a center channel above a plasma (or any other TV, and behind the screen [the best possible spot] for projectors).  In the very least I expected a list of home interior product manufacturers who make home theater equipment.  Like Guilford of Maine (who make acoustically transparent fabric), Owens Corning who make Acoustic Blanket, and other companies that make home theater seating and so on.  The book should have talked about not using glossy paint due to its reflective properties and touched on what type of carpeting is best suited to your home theater - a question I am still looking into.  I would think most people would have loved tips for hiding speaker wire, a list of colors (other than flat black) and a discussion of what colors work well together if you decide on a two-tone room.  Unfortunately none, I mean NONE of this was even referenced in this book.  Krissy just doesn't "get it" and you shouldn't get this book. 
 I WAS REALLY LET DOWN,I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY WILL PATTON THE ACTOR:{ BUMMER DUDE. A WASTE OF $.. 
 Sylvain Beauregard is WIDELY known to die-hard (and average) Celine fans as having a very large ego, not shutting his mouth, and insulting every other Celine fan out there.  Take the "Syl" off, and you have his real identity.  I have never read this book, and I never will.  Endorsing this man and his work is an insult to Celine herself.  Sylvain says he has all these contacts with Celine, her staff, etc. but he has never met her, which I find very odd.  If you REALLY want to know about Celine, read her AUTHORIZED biography and autobiography.  If you really love and admire Celine, DO NOT humor this man 
 The movie is fine, but............... There is no mention in the description that this is a widescreen format. I use full screen. When I contacted amazon to find if it was available in full screen, the response was send it back if you don't want it. I kept it, but was not happy with customer service 
 When this book starts with the supposition that these are some of the things that the United States should do, it negates the fact that the United States has done a significant number of those things and does not distinguish between the things it is doing and should be doing.   Additionally while contributing a solution to the war on terror in Iraq, the group failed to outline the specifics of strategy necessary and used ambiguous terms that could mean many things to many different people.  What I found most troubling about the report though was the arrogance of these folks. While this is well intended, the United States is a sovereign state and we are assisting our new friends in Iraq who are also a sovereign state. Iraq is not a providence of the United States and that relationship, however unique in the world right now, does not make Iraq the 51st State or an extension of US foreign policy. There are channels that even our state department officials and their diplomatic corps must work through. There are intelligence channels in the largest CIA office in the Arab world being worked. The US military in Iraq is working in a unified chain of command with the Iraqi's to secure their borders and Baghdad.   The problem however, is not adequately addressed through this report and that is the brain-drain in Iraq that has occurred from 30+ years of tyranny and war. This is the core issue that fuels the sectarian fight and smart people can help Iraq rebuild its basic services and infrastructure that has been destroyed by more than the United States presence and the war there.   There is another problem with Iraq that the report does not even attempt to touch. Where is the rest of the world? After all these, are State Department Heavy weights? How about Saudi Arabia and Kuwait restructuring and forgiving significant amounts of war reparations from Saddam Hussein still owed by the Iraqi people and government. It is 2007, let us move on, and forgive. How about the mighty European nations who currently aren't part of the coalition of the willing? They have seen what two world wars can do to their home lands. They know the death and destruction and have lost their taste for war. How about some significant contributions in humanitarian assistance instead of the people in the crowd pointing fingers and attempting to look "too cool" to get their feet sandy and roll up those sleeves and get some humanitarian aid in there and how about some oversight so the oil-for-food thing doesn't repeat itself.   Let us get the EU to shift their oil purchasing power away from the tyranny in Iran and encourage growth in the Iraqi government by buying Iraqi whose government is doing its dandiest to be more pro western than any other Muslim government in the world with the exception of Turkey.  How come these ideas weren't on the table?  How about the use of American forces specifically in changing the rules of engagement in the country. If Americans are fired on, we are going to kill you period. If you hide in a mosque, we will hunt you down and kill you. If you use your religion and innocents to further your political aims, we will kill you.   How about pressuring the Russians to assist in Iraq rebuilding by forgiving the Iraqi debt and to stop selling terrorist guns.  Let us really get serious about the problems. They had many good starts in this book but it definitely didn't do enough...and talking with the Iranians hasn't done the EU and Japanese any good...a liar is still a liar and after all they've stated they want to blow us up...are there reasonable people in the government or have they all been exiled, jailed or killed as was the case in a totalitarian régime like Iraq? Just something to consider. 
 this movie is pretty dull and a good example of a bad film adaptation of a kind of okay book.  sometimes it's laughable when it's not supposed to be, hahaha!!  i laughed 
 To start off with, I want to say that I really loved Ilium, and had very high hopes for Olympos. But I was ultimately dissapointed. There are a number of flaws I found in the book, most of which I'll mention here.  Like another reviewer, I was hoping the focus of Olympos would be the war between the united Greeks and Trojans against the gods. To avoid spoilers I won't say much other than there is very little time given to this conflict, which I found very dissapointing.  As many other reviewers have mentioned, the book seems to build for a long time, to what the reader hopes will be some sort of epic intense conclusion, but ultimately there is barely a climax at all. Also, not all mysteries set up by the book are explained (though overall a great deal will become more clear, there are a number of unexplained bits that annoy me). Along with unexplained mysteries, there are a few points in which the motivations of characters do not make much sense.  Also, one specific conflict we are essentially promised at the end of Ilium, and is foreshadowed a number of times in Olympos, never actually occurs. The reader is supposed to accept that this sort of showdown will probably happen at some point after the events of the book.   Olympos also lacks the intensity and action of Ilium. I remember reading the last 300 pages of Ilium in one sitting because  I was so enthralled. Olympos never reaches this level. In fact, by the end I was already dissapointed enough that I practically had to force myself to finish it.  One final thing that bothered me were a number of anti-Islam and homophobic bits that really add nothing to the story. They were essentially purposeless, yet they were there. At one point near the end homosexuality is described as if it was just some psychological disease existing only in the 21st century. This passage comes from nowhere, and like I said, serves no purpose.   While I still think Ilium was an amazing book, this sequal did not come close to meeting its promise 
 Long story short, it's a book about giant, killer moths.  You either buy into the premise and go with it at a bajillion $.50 words or you find it entirely ludicrous and you chuck the book against the wall.  Personally, I was in the latter category right up until we meet the ambassador from Hell, at which point the book broke into such an insane mess that I couldn't stop reading it.  Also, I was in Nairobi, Kenya, and I couldn't find any other sci-fi to tweak my interests.  But mostly, the book's giant, killer moths and trying to figure out how to kill these things because everyone seems to be too stupid to just firebomb the Hell out of them or poison them or, you know, other smarty pants things.  I know this review may not seem too helpful, but I don't know how else to say that the book follows a bunch of stupid people hunting down brain-sucking insects.  Maybe like that.  I'm going to make that my title now.  So, if you buy this, hey!  Good luck 
 but this abridgement is the poorest that I have ever heard or read. There were many elements left out of the story, including some that were mentioned on the cover! With all the missing elements of the story, I'm sure there were nuances that were totally missed, leaving just a fair story with no build up or satisfying resolution. What remained was a "B" grade short story, making me very cautious to ever buy another abridgement. If you like Robin Cook, and want to hear this audio book, I strongly suggest you listen to the unabridged version. It most definitely has to be much better! 
 I'm surprised this show got past Season 1. Honestly, more talent can be found in my local karaoke bar. This show does NOT discover talent, they produce and market it. It is really demeaning to musicians everywhere. The judges are a joke, I guess the producers tell them what to say. Simon "the jerk" Cowell tries hard to be rude to everyone, hey...he has made a living out of it. Randy Jackson's vocab is limited to "yo", "yeah" and "dawg". Paula, who's the only one who I think deserves to even comment on the singers..unfortunately praises everyone, be it for their performance/energy/character/looks/(fill with any word of your choice). All in all, a total disaster...only in shows this sh*tty, can no-talents like William Hung be hailed as a celebrity. I am shocked people other than the families of those participating would actually spend time and money voting for these posers. On a more positive note, it's good that people don't actually buy the albums, thus resulting in total disappearing acts from Idol winners like Ruben and Fantasia...now we just need the American public to stop tuning in to the shows. Well, hope is all we have, right 
 Percy Jones does not appear on this one and his absence is obvious. I really like Livestock and Moroccan Roll but not this one at all 
 Have used these recipes. she and her recipes are authentic , and well reviewed

 This product does not produce a clear sound.  The connection emits static and can be annoying to listen to.  We ordered two of these and they both have had the same results 
 I like the way this book teaches the bridge pattern. I liked the first edition as a stop-gap. I had anticipated that the second edition would beef the book up in several areas - it didn't. My main problem with this book is that it doesn't stand the test of time. I do not find myself coming back to it 
 If I wanted to listen to Interpol-I would. So what if they're British. I'm Texan. How does this fact make these schmucks better than American bands creating that "brit-rock" sound? That's right it doesn't. Now I'm not defending bands like The Bravery or The Killers (I am defending Interpol) but at least these guys jumped on the band wagen at least two years ago. Where were the "Editors" in 2002? Still struggling? Interpol had their debut out way before the "Editors". Just because this Tom Smith putz has an accent people are flocking to him. Fine. Slap an accent on Paul Banks and call it a day. The fact is "Antics", Interpol's weakest album (but still freakin' brilliant) surpasses anything from "The Back Room" 
 I would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good. Overall the book in my mind cannot even be compared to Notes From Underground which is a true existential work of art. My bias I believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person, not just simply more apathetic such as The Strangers main character. I found the book to be very boring. This is just my opinion, and many people find the book great and I have no quarrel with that 
 Although I found the period writing style interesting and the review of Poe's life refreshing, I was puzzled how the death of Mary Rogers and its coupling with Poe's " The Mystery of Marie Roget " really broke any new ground in our understanding of the unsolved murder.  Both the police and Poe engaged in an array of theories and speculations regarding the Beautiful Cigar Girl's demise; however, neither was able to successfully deduce who the real perpetrator or perpetrators were. This made for me the reader a conundrum unfulfilled and wholly unsatisfying - thus wondering why the author went to the trouble of writing on this frustrating subject in the first place.  Next time I would suggest that Mr. Stashower choose a topic that offers the reader more substance than tone and period atmosphere - one with an actual resolution 
 After I rescued 2 beta fish from very poor conditions, I needed some really good information on their care. I did not find it in this book. It has a couple paragraphs about diseases, absolutely no charts or diagrams for biology or anything, and while the pictures were really beautiful, they had nothing to do with the topic on the same pages. There is a lot about how to have beta fights, and speaks of it in a very condoning tone! This is quite cruel and inhumane. There is I grant you some decent very basic info that you could glean off the internet yourself in an hour or two 
 Be warned. The Office Project program advertised as included is a trial version. The ad does not say this. Now I have to turn around a buy a new program- Amazon customer service says it isn't their fault. I really needed the book and the program for a class due to start in four days. Now I'm really stuck. Amazon is even trying to get me to pay for the return shipping 
 I'm not criticizing the VHS/DVD; I haven't yet seen it.  What bugs me is the fact that I was ready to order an Iron Chef video, but not until Checkout did Amazon.com bother to add the phrase "with William Shatner" to the product description, which gave me sufficient pause to hit the "back" button and read these reviews.  Now I realize it's NOT the original Japanese TV series.  Is this a case of your Marketing Department once again overcoming honesty and forthrightness?  You're really no different from any other snake oil salemen, are you 
 As a frequent visitor to the Himalayas and being closely in touch with both Tibetans (ordinary folks, not the tortured ones) and the Chinese, I find this documentary interesting but terribly one-sided. I have not met a single wealthy Tibetan in Nepal or India, who can swear to me that he will return to a freed Tibet, run by their government in exile.   To be fair to the "experts", a lot of the evidence of Chinese violence against the Tibetans is real. I sincerely feel sorry for them and wish that they could somehow be compensated. However, the documentary gets emotive and it seems bent on presenting the situation in Tibet entirely from the viewpoint of the activists and other victims of Chinese aggression.  While it is true that many Tibetans suffered and died during the invasion and subsequent crushing of riots that erupted from time to time, it is unfair to assume that the soldiers and police were the only ones responsible for the deaths and injuries. Were there no looters, vandals, infighting? If you had ever witnessed these riots, would you think that more people might have been hurt or killed had the soldiers not opened fire?  It's also incredibly naive to assume that all Tibetans think the same. Even Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government in exile is not without opposition, violence and even assasination. While I do think that most Tibetans are good Buddhists and nice people, the documentary seems to associate everything sinful with the Chinese and everything saintly with the Tibetans. This is something I find totally unacceptable.  A few snapshots of Tibetan mobs welcoming the delegates from exile tell us nothing. The documentary seems only able to find Tibetans who are against Chinese rule. They paint the picture that nobody in Tibet is happy. This is patently untrue. But then, this sort of thing sells in America. You have to have a demon, you have to have a damsel in distress and you must have the hero (America in this case). Otherwise, it just won't sell. It's not about compassion at all.  If you really want to be "illuminated", visit Tibet and Tibetan communities all over China and see things for yourself. That would be far more enlightening. Sadly, many journalists prefer to interview the wrong (right?) people in order to get a sensational story that will pay for the rent 
 I was looking for a trampoline and I kept looking around for the encloser trampolines.  I purchased the 13 foot trampoline encloser but I didn't realize that the trampoline came separate.  I have the encloser kit witch I spent $70.00 on and no trampoline.  When I looked on the internet I never saw that the tramponine was separate and it wasn't clearly explained that it was just the encloser part.  I also found out that the size of the trampone is not standard, therefore, in order to utilize the encloser kit, I have to spend another $110.00 for shipping on top of the shipping it cost me for the cover and the encloser kit.  I am really upset that this is costing a large amount of money just because they didn't specifically say that the encloser kit needed the trampoline. Bevery careful, it is not every day that you go out and buy a trampoline and the encloser kits are totaly separate.  I am very disapointed 
 For those thinking about buying this book. One word of caution, it is NOT specifically about TWC. It is more about creating a business from the ground up and ignoring critics, blah, blah, blah. I was hoping for a behind-the-sences type of book on TWC, but this is not the case. A pretty dull book IMO, but a great book if you're a business person 
 Look a little harder if you want an alternative to boxers and bland briefs.  The Elance is poorly made and designed, Jockey is barely evern trying.  Look on the web guys, there are better choices.... Jockey's Elance and the similar department store knockoffs of womens underwear are lame 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 If you're into very traditional, formal poetry, than this is the volume for you.  However, if you're looking for something more original and inspired, you may be disappointed.  I was looking for fodder for my wedding ceremony and found scant evidence of any deeply evocative poetry in this volume 
 I read this book as part of a book discussion group I had joined and it was so wretchedly lackluster it proved to be the death knell of me ever going back to the group. This book was half-baked, boring, and grievously devoid of even the tiniest bit of interest. I can't even give it credit for having any sort of vocabulary beyond the comprehension of an average twelve year old. The characters were so flat that I didn't even finish it. Later I heard from the other book discussion members even the title was a let down as Morgan never actually passed away (`twould have been a fitting end though - much like converting a testy horse into glue, something of actual use.) I've never read any of Anne Tyler's books but after this little gem I doubt I'll ever pick up another. 
 Maybe graphic designers will like it but I did not find the images something I wanted look at.  Made my head hurt.  It is packed with a lot of filler: reasons the artist did what he did, what his favorite things are, and why this project was so so difficult for him.   
 Heinlein is a great author.  When he sits back and tells a story, he's one of the best.  Glory Road and Citizen of the Galaxy are wonderful, and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress should be on the shelf of any science fiction fan.  This, however, is an awful book.  It's not merely one of Heinlein's worst.  It's one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read.  The problem isn't that there's no action, although there isn't.  The problem is that there isn't anything of substance to replace it.  There's lots of sex, but not in enough detail to be titilating.  There isn't a love story either; you can't have romance or sexual tension when your characters will sleep with anyone and everyone for any reason.  The book just rambles aimlessly until it ends.  Maybe Heinlein was trying for an examination of gender roles and sexual identity, but if so he failed miserably.  The characters in this book aren't just from a different culture; they aren't people at all.  They're too flat.  If you want to think about such things, ponder them on your own or read a different book.  I suggest Left Hand Of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin.  I Will Fear No Evil reads like an old man's rambling personal fantasies.  Someone must like it, but I can't recommend it even to the most devoted Heinlein fans.  If you're tempted, do yourself a favor and re-read Stranger In A Strange Land instead 
 This book makes saltwater aquariums seem easier than they actually are. For one, I don't even think the book mentions the use of reverse osmosis or deionized water, which is strongly recommended by all marine aquarists. The author also doesn't mention the importance of live rock. In fact, he goes as far to advise against using live rock for fish-only tanks! Sure, you might be able to get away with not using live rock, but it won't be worth it in the long run. Also, I don't agree with the list of recommended filter combinations. One more thing, the book lists an air stone as essential equipment, but the only thing an air stone will do is aid evaporation and cause salt creep! If you have enough movement of water at the surface, you should get sufficient gas exchange. There is, however, one thing the book does get right: its strong recommendation of using a protein skimmer.  This book is easy to understand, but you won't be getting the best information 
 Horrible, boring film from one of my top 10 favorite directors.  The only thing worth seeing is the amazing "tiara" of candles that Goya (supposedly?) uses to paint at night.  BORING! 
 My kids love these research guide books from Magic Tree House writers but this one was a disappointment. One whole chapter was devoted to the big bang theory which we personally don't believe in. They should have skipped this chapter and focused on facts. 
 The day that Morris can get an article published  in the Journal of Science or similar publication he will diserve an appology. Until then he should appologize to the scientific community for his misrepresentations, out right lies and frau 
 I may be repeating what others have said in previous reviews, but I just had to vent over this book. After reading Interview with the Vampire, and the other Vampire Chronicles before Merrick, I was highly disappointed over this book. The action and references to Voodun were vague and boring. The book revolves around a plot concocted by David Talbot and Louis the Vampire to use Merrick in order to contact the ghost of Claudia. Then, the book moves into this tedious tangent over the life of Merrick Mayfair, a character Anne Rice fails to develop as a complex individual. The action in this book is cheesy, typical, and EXTREMELY predictable. The book introduces characters that are related to Merrick, and it is not difficult to guess the fate of these characters as a reader. The vampires are barely portrayed as the mysterious, yet dangerous, and bloodlusting characters they once were in the previous novels. The vampires in Merrick, especially Louis, are portrayed as weak and gutless. Yes, Louis is a tortured soul, but his portrayal is severely watered down in this novel, and his weak nature is irritating to read about. Compare the vampires in Merrick to the same vampires portrayed in Queen of the Damned, like the characters of Akasha and Kayman, who enjoyed "devouring the marrow from their victims' bones". The vampires in Anne Rice's previous books captured the reader's attention with their viciousness, and vengeaful, yet human qualities. Anne Rice did not seem to balance these qualities in the novel Merrick as she did in her others. The action in this novel is painfully slow and without direction. The book is also full of references to David's annoying, perverse tendencies that were written merely to try to increase book sales. Skip this novel, and move on to one of her other vampire chronicles, preferrably her early novels. This just does not cut it 
 First, I listened to the unabridged audio edition. Its clearly missing a few scenes referenced in this novel. However, what I don't miss is the endless scenes of people falling to their knees, weeping, invoking God and tearing their clothes. The count choc-u-lah voice of Anti-Christ was ludicrous and painful to hear. The endless discussions of hacking, and reading lengthy sermons from Judah, and listening to Chloe whine and Buck cry. I honestly can read no more. I thought I could finish out this series, but the Desecration was the worst book I've read in the series to date. Carpathia cavorting on the back of the pig was the final straw.  What made this series great- the trials of an everyday Joe caught up in events beyond his control has devolved into a Christian themed Ludlum novel with Buck and Rayford traveling the globe to rescue small-time Christians who get killed anyway, while ignoring their own families. Christians in these books bait and mock unbelievers and the bad guys act like keystone cops. If Satan were as stupid as he's portrayed in this novel Eve would never have taken a bite from the apple.  Frankly, I finished this book, hoping Carpathia would whack Rayford and the rest of the tribulation force. They are so annoying and sanctimonious. 2 stars. 
 I read Bonfire, Man In Full, Right Stuff, and Hooking Up, and then tried this one. I could not stand it! Amazing some of these reviews. If you read one of the above and want to try another, stick to that list. Electric Kook-Aide is difficult to read if you like a story that flows and becomes a page turner 
 This book was stupid,short and senseless.This was the worst book I have ever read...It was difficult to keep reading this book.I would recommmend that you not read this book.To make this book better it could have been longer.This whole book is like an introduction to some vampire book....after reading the whole book I fine myself asking the question,when is the story going to start? Here is the main plot:We again meet Louis, Lestat, and David. They are followed by the beautiful witch Merrick, an offshoot of the Mayfair clan, who knew David when he was a mortal man working as a member of the Talamasca. Louis seeks Merrick's help in resurrecting the spirit of Claudia.  This novel is a major turning point for Louis: he attempts to commit suicide by allowing himself to bake in the sun. The other vampires, including Merrick, David and Lestat, find him and restore him by showering him with their preternatural blood.  Most of the novel is a rather long flashback detailing David and Merrick's adventures. Readers meet Merrick's malevolent sister, Honey Isabella or Honey in the Sunshine; Merrick's mother, Cold Sandra; and the Great Nananne, a powerful witch whose very presence is enough to frighten and instill respect in Talbot.  One notable adventure involves a journey to Central America, which Merrick is compelled to undertake by dreams of Oncle Julien (or so she thinks). Merrick and David find the cave where Matthew had contracted a fatal disease. David is surprised at the malevolence of the spirits in the cave and conjectures that they are protecting some great treasure. Merrick leaps forward and finds the treasure: a beautiful jade mask. By looking through this mask, one can see ethereal spirits as if they were corporeal. The two Talamascans see a mysterious spirit who resembles a priest. David then falls deathly sick, though Merrick does not. The two escape the treacherous cave, with David growing weaker by the moment; he is shuffled from hospital to hospital and is eventually cured of the disease.  At the very end of the book, Merrick reveals her grand scheme. It was she who, from the very beginning, had used her potent magic to draw David and Louis inexorably towards her so that she would receive the Dark Gift of vampirism.  Because Lestat (along with Louis) have given Merrick their blood, the Talamasca Elders threaten to wage war on the vampires. David Talbot tries to placate them with a final letter, warning that Lestat's enmity is more than the Watcher society could handle. He writes, "You have made yourselves an interesting adversary to one who loves challenges, and it will require all of my considerable influence to protect you individually and collectively from the avid lust you have so foolishly aroused."  In this novel, it becomes clear that one of the largest myths of the Vampire Chronicles series is in fact false. Throughout the series, it seems that a witch's powers are lost upon his or her transformation into a vampire. However, Merrick does not experience this loss...enjoy....Nigel     
 I have read hundreds of graphic novels, and I saw the buzz on this.  I guess I have never been a huge Grant Morrison fan, though he has his moments.  This was his attempt to create a completely new universe out of old characters.  I tried to get started, couldn't finish.  If you are a completest, go for it.  There is better stuff out there.  Re-readability: 2/10  *I always put re-readability in my reviews for people who like to keep their TPB to re-read 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 I could not believe the condition in which this rolling pin arrived.  When I opened the bag around the pin one handle fell off.  When I looked at the pin I noticed huge dark gouges in the wood pieces that make the ravioli.  I thought that was bad enough but when I turned the pin over there was a huge chunk out of one of the wood pieces.  Needless to say, it's useless.  This was my first experience with amazon and it will be my last 
 Don't buy this one. This is just a bunch of blah blah blah written by a guy who does not master the English language, so he uses a lot of filler words just to pile up pages of useless information. Not even the examples at the end of the book are well laid. He used some canned spreadsheet tables to fill in things like "risky" - "medium risk" - "safe" etc... which is just a complete nonsense in Forex.  What really made me mad was the horrible way this book is written. This Russian author could have phrased sentences using less than half of the words he used. It's a no more than a 10 page book streched to more than a 100 pages of you know what. Lame 
 I've never read this writer before but I picked it up in the grocery store because I read the back cover and thought it sounded interesting. I was very mistaken. I found the book long, drawn out and boring and to top it off I really dislike both the main leads. 
 I live in Utah and purchased two of these for my home. Within a day everything was covered with white dust, on calling their customer service, they asked for my zip code...they then informed me they are not recommended for my area, due to the hard water, and to return them to the store. Unfortunately not before the dust had got into my computer hard drive and DVD players, rendering them virtually useless. Why distribute them in a hard water area in the first place ? This is a law suit waiting to happen. I purchased one Evaparotive type of Humidifier from Sears for half the price and there is no dust whatsoever and it is maintaining a comfortable 50% humidity throughout my house 
 Not worth a dime! Poorly written with no experiential power to back the words. Written for making money not enlightenment. Not even worth one star 
 When you look at the title of this book--Planet of the Beast, you think maybe the author is referring to Jason? Nope rather a stupidly contrived planet nick-name for planet #666 how dumb is that? However being that this is a sci-fi Horror, I'm willing to just go with the flow and give the author Nancy Kilpatrick the benefit of the doubt. Planet of the Beast is a slow read, not totally intolerable like the last book, "the Experiment" by Pat Cadigan.  The first half of this book introduces 11 characters living at space station G7 including a meglomaniac doctor and his weasaly assistant which definatley had over tones of Dr Frankenstein and Igor all over it. Including their plan to "create" a new being by way of cloning. Total cheese.     After 200 pages of space regulations and botched interstellar protocol and characters pulling rank on each other our guy Jason finally shows up on board to wreak havoc.  Some of the scenes are pretty cool in typical Jason style, but again(which happens in a lot of these Jason X novels or the Friday the 13th novels) Jason takes a back seat to yet more character development and personal insight. I don't really need to know all that extraneous info on a character that gets disemboweled!     This book could have been any sci fi book, all you had to do was insert the word "alien" or "monster" into the spots that says "Jason X."  Technology on the space station is o.k. for a sci fi book that takes place in the 24th Century, some force fields, advanced nanotechnology, interesting space suits and laser weapons outfit the G7 space station/lab.  The Author almost gives you a walk through of the space station as the story progresses, almost like its a travelogue.      Oh yeah, whats this bunk with calling him "Jason X"? I thought he was just plain old Jason?  Jason "X" was just the number of the film, you know X=10.  The hokey camp fire stories being told by one of the characters pits jason against soldiers in louisiana swamp, and another has Jason back in the 1930's going after Dorothy and Toto. What was the author thinking? Fortunately the Jason and the Wizard of Oz scenerio is pre-empted to go to another scene and then rejoined as the character is finishing. Thank god!    Planet of the Beast has a better second half, but it was still painful to digest. I thought the action could have been a lot better, the urgency of the characters wasn't described good enough.  I also notice several typo's and misspelled words throughout the book.  Bottom Line......try to keep yourself awake reading this one 
 Starts off with a good murder scene and then drifts off into erudite intellectual fluff and nonsense which causes the murder mystery plot to disappear like dew in Dante's inferno. Very disappointing 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 There are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff. It's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin C. A completely pathetic rip-off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product.  Supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices. If you want an energy drink try Rockstar or Monster. If you want to support the troops buy a savings bond 
 This book is basically an "infommercial" for Mr. Williams Psych-K workshops. The workshops are provided at two levels - Basic and Advanced. The book gives a bit of the history of how the core (the "Balances") of the technique was developed, but not much solid information. It turns out that you don't get to learn the "Balances" until you take the Advanced workshop - approximately $1000 later. If you know nothing about kinesiology or the concepts of the conscious and subconscious minds, you might get something useful out of this book. However, this slim book of 150 pages, with the wide margins, large print, wide line spacing and many testamonials could probably be condensed into a booklet one third the size. It's hard to justify the cost of this book considering the lean content. It makes me wonder if Mr. Williams much-touted experience in the world of business hasn't led him to maximize his profit over all other considerations. Had I not first heard of Psych-K in a different venue, I doubt that I would pursue it any further from reading this book. Indeed, it's increased my wariness as to whether there is any possible benefit to be derived from the technique. That being said, I may possibly attend a workshop sometime in the future, so Mr. Williams may prove to be, at least, a good saleman 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 I read this novel the instant it came out.  Everyone was starving for more Star Wars.  Most of us mistakenly thought the sequel to the movie was going to be based on this book, but happily, it wasn't.  Its been many years since I read this book but I distinctly remember feeling it was all wrong.  The stakes in this story are very small.  HOWEVER, in spite of not liking the book, I still have it on my bookshelf twenty years later, because the cover art is AWESOME!  It was the coolest star wars illustration around at the time, and still is a classic.  there have been several covers for this novel, but the one I had featured a silhouette of Darth against a foggy forest, with Luke and Leia cowering in the foreground by a glowing red crystal.  Save yourself the money, and just do a google search and look at the cover.  Its very cool 
 I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate. Well the story line may be interesting but the writing is atrocious. It is curricular, bloated, and seemingly pointless. The characters just keep rattling. A lot of writers fill in the story with descriptions of time and place to give an atmosphere to the story. This writer (Wilkie Collins) just fills it with unrelated trivia. Every once in a while I would go back a few pages to see what I must have missed. When I read again there was nothing there to miss. Ether Wilkie is extremely monotonous or other writing from this period is and I am just now lucky enough to find out. I talked to others about this and they said; "Now you know why Sherlock Holmes is so popular"   
 this is another story that I don't know if I like it or not because Amazon.com never sent it too me.  this has happened about 4/5 times.  While usually I have no problem getting movies, sometimes I do.  sending them e-mails doesn't seem to work.  If they didn't have the best prices for movies, I'd leave 
 Pleasant movie but nothing special, a very ordinary story. Audrey Hepburn's charisma is what puts some life to the movie. Some subtle humour though 
 I like Dale Brown and his work but this book is not good. There are way too many holes in the book. The way the bad guys are able to escape the inept government at every turn is aggravating. Also, midway through the book, the main terrorist discovers that he is the sword of Satan from a tarot reading women. What is that whole section book about? Totally out of place in military thriller. The story is interesting, but the book didn't flow like most of Dale Brown's book and the many holes insult the reader's intelligence. Overall I give 2 stars because of the interesting story, but not one of Dale Brown's best works 
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 Hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states, I have a problem with my camera and I don't have anyone to help, I've been trying some help in amazon's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where I can ask for some help, I don't really understand why is this site so well known on "customer service", but I just cannot communicate with no one in the company to ask anything, I'm just mad about this, if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there's no such a thing like help in the "help area". I need to repair my LCD monitor of my camera, it's really fragile, so if you're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm, don't do it, they don't care about the customer satisfaction at all 
 This stinker comes close to equalling that gigantic bomb from 2001 "Pearl Harbour" starring Ben Affleck. The acting is wooden and forgettable, the action sequences are humorous at best, and the direction is...well, let's just say, director Tony Bill has apparently picked up his directing chops while starring in "Barb Wire". The directing style seems to be...throw in as much loud music as possible, add a heaping helping of a lame love story, toss on some of the worst, most embarrassing lines imaginable, and let's not forget those all important CGI effects and what you end up with is the worst/funniest depiction of WW1 flying action since the Three stooges.   If you want to watch REAL WW1 flying action with REAL WW1 biplanes, check out "The Blue Max". That movie used real WW1 vintage aircraft, that actually have weight to them and do NOT perform impossible flying stunts that the Blue Angels do not even attempt using FA-18 jets.   Pacing is terribly frantic, music is insufferable, character development and construction of any dramatic impact is non-existent.  Pass this one by, unless you're willing to spend 2 hours viewing an all too typical expensive, wasteful, useless, hollywood blockbuster bomb 
 There is no doubt in my mind that Josh Harris is a good person, who sincerely wants to help people, particularly young Christian women, who are especially affected by the vicissitudes of the modern dating scene. However, he doesn't seem to offer much honesty about why this book has been so popular.  Either he's guilelessly uninformed or deliberately avoidant: inexcusable in either case, considering how influential this book has become.   Is it because it offers the best possible advice on how to navigate the most clear and direct path from singleness to marriage?  No.  For the vast majority of singles, the approach described in this book will be too rigid and contrived to be workable.  Few couples have actually gotten together this way.  The real reason why this book, with its overwhelmingly female readership, has sold so well comes down to one main reason: there is a SEVERE SHORTAGE OF SINGLE CHRISTIAN MEN, as documented in CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com male/female ratios, and the Barna Research group website which estimates the shortfall to be in the MILLIONS.  Christianity Today recently identified the gender imbalance as being the issue that "rises to the top" for Christian singles.  Because Christians are encouraged to look at circumstances as springing from "God's plan" for their lives, many of the surplus women faithfully avoid doing the math, but certainly feel the lack of male attention.  Unfortunately, this often gets boiled down to some kind of "passive Christian guy thing", but it probably has more to do with the complacency that accompanies the abundance of women: which is the defining masculine climate wherever there is a man shortage, whether it's New York City, Post-war Russia or your local mega-church.  It's not so much a lack of male leadership, but a lack of males.  And so the idea of courtship appeals to the romantic longings of single Christian women frustrated by what they perceive to be a lack of initiative taken by single Christian men, who they greatly outnumber.  Since reading Christian books about relationships can be as titilating as any romance novel, many of these women will pour over every detail looking for the one piece of advice, the one thing they can change about themselves that will make a difference.  Which means they stay on the spiritual self-improvement treadmill, fuelling a Christian singleness industry with its own slogan "The Gift of Singleness" that refuses to tell them the truth about the Christian man shortage that is the greatest cause of their prolonged singleness!  Of course, their lack of contentment (an innate response that tells you that things don't add up) is something they are told to repent, ironically by pundits who themselves will not repent of how they profit from this symbiotic relationship.  But as long as these women can be convinced that their discontent is caused not by unnaturally protracted singleness that's the result of the Christian man shortage but their by own spiritual failings, there'll always be a market for Christian self-help books like this one.  Pure genius!  What's more, there are "unintended consequences" that can go along with Harris' model for "courtship" that he doesn't really address:  1) Because all masculine initiative taking must be based on a guy's intention to marry the woman, it makes asking a woman to do anything a BIG DEAL to him. This can have several sub-consequences:  (a) It creates a lot of anxiety for guys in terms of their decision-making and rejection-risk (getting turned down for a date is bad enough, but imagine having your "potential marriage proposal" crash and burn!) (b) It fosters prolonged crushes, as stakes get so high with the guy investing all kinds of time and energy in figuring out that this is "the one", he might not ever do it (c) Ironically, it can boost up the guy's expectations in terms of a woman's looks. Because the guy has to have everything worked out in their heads (that yes, this is the kind of woman I want to marry) lot of guys end up not bothering to spend time with girls who don't LOOK like whatever their "wife prototype" might be. Guys who date and don't make a big deal of "a date" are more likely to ask out women they never thought of marrying and possibly end up getting married anyways (In "How to Get a Date Worth Keeping", Henry Cloud explains how couples will admit that their spouses weren't really "their type" when they first met).  2) It keeps people from the humbling reality check that dating provides. Serial dating (as practiced in Latin American countries, where a guy will ask out tons of women, get turned down by most of them until he has a "short-list") teaches you where you stand with the opposite sex. You ask your way down your "ladder of options" until you find your equal (likewise for women, in terms of dealing with the facts about who's asking and who's not). With courtship, a man or woman can nurse an untested prototype of what they want in their heads for years. The idea that it's better not to have any previous flames to compare them to is FALSE. You're better off being compared to their last girlfriend/boyfriend (a real human being with chunky thighs and all) than with the evangelical Angelica Jolie/Brad Pitt that has filled their imaginations since adolescence!  3) It reduces interactive opportunities that promote the acquisition of social skills needed in a romantic context with the opposite sex. It reinforces the pattern of psycho-social-sexual immaturity you commonly see in Christian singles circles.  4) It's unfair to the woman to have some guy spring a potential marriage proposal (which is essentially what courtship is) on her without any prior notice that the guy (who's had a head start on working out his feelings) is romantically interested. Most Christian women seem to need some time to progressively get used to the idea of having a date with most of the guys who would realistically ask them, let alone entertain the thought of marriage.  5) It also heightens the significance of anything the men do when interacting with the women in their circle, who inevitably end up reading too much into their behavior and expecting too much whenever any nuance of interest gets expressed by a someone they like. Kind of like, "he's a nice, sincere, Christian guy and he wouldn't be spending this kind of time with me if he didn't think of me as marriage material, right?"...not always so.   If we are to stand back and take a look at it, the whole courtship redux really hasn't gotten off the ground: it works for too few people at this time. Maybe the world has changed too much, or perhaps there are other issues today's Christian singles face in the mating game that need to be dealt with first: such as the confusion about "the gift of singleness" and the shortage of men. I would recommend Debbie Maken's Getting Serious about Getting Married: Rethinking the Gift of Singleness for an alternative view of courtship that embraces the ordinariness and universality of marriage, instead of this moldy oldy. 
 This "Tea Cattle" is absolutely adorable.  It is not practical for daily use.  The spout doesn't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove.  The lid doesn't remove easily and more often then not knuckles will be knocked on the handle that does not move.  
 Persia Vanderbilt has grown tiresome for me.  The endless self-absorbtion of the character has worn out its welcome.  More emphasis on the town, her auntie, the shop and the plot would be welcome.  Less emphasis on how toned and fit Persia is, and much less description about what she's wearing might make me come back.  As much as I hate to say it, it was a struggle to get through the book.

 Whether William Golding deserved Nobel Prize or not is still a debatable point, but it is true that he wrote one marvelous book, and its name is `Lord of the Flies.' But let's not talk about the differences between the book and the film for a while - because after all no one I am afraid can bring the multi-layered world of words onto the screen. Even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that. You can interpret the meaning of `Lord of the Flies' but who can really visualize it, or the imaginary conversations of Simon for that matter?  The biggest problem of Harry Hook's new version is not the changes done to the film. The boys are American military school cadets, using dirty words frequently, but those parts didn't annoy me much. Real problem is something more essential to the film, which is storytelling. In short the 1990 film doesn't know what it wants to be. On the film's video cover you can read (and I quote) `this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul." Well, not exactly.  For as adventure story it lacks pace; the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing. As allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character. The conflict between Ralph and Jack should be clearer, and Piggy's role should be more than that of a whining fat boy. And don't forget Simon, who sees things, it is true, but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us.  It is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful. It could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop, opposite of optimistic tales of Jules Verne's adventure stories. By watching this film you can follow the story of the book, but find no tension or thought-provoking words in it.  Balthazar Getty's feature film debut. And Lewis M. Allen, one of the producers of the film, had also produced Peter Brook version in 1963 
 A very disappointing performance by Chappelle.  Everything that makes "Killin' them Softly" great is missing here.  Dave doesn't seem to be enjoying himself doing standup in this show.  The jokes aren't sharp, and he lacks the energy he usually exudes.  There are some funny moments, but I don't know...this just falls so short of everything else he's done.  I love Dave, but I think the pressure of being funny and his show really took a toll on him by this point.  We'll just need to look forward to Chappelle's Show Season 3!!!  
 I bought this to help me eat right while pregnant.  i have been a vegetarian for years.  i wanted to make sure I was getting the perfect nutrtion for my growing baby.  The book is pretty informative.  It does contain shopping lists and tons of recipes.  I found that the recipes seemed a bit complicated, because of the amount of ingredients needed and its not just stuff that most people would have lying around the house.  I haven't cooked anyhting out of the book yet, but have used a lot of the tips she offers.  I guess I am just not much of a cook.  I am a young newlywed with all the time in the world, but I am pregnant and therefore exhausted.  I also don't have the cash to spend on all the weird ingredients you need on hand, which I would have to buy at the local co-op which is super expensive.  If you love cooking this book is great, if you are looking for simple recipes or info on vegetarian pregnancy, seek out another resource 
 Very typical of the academic side of the study of the stock market and derivatives - making up unique notation, assuming simplifications (e.g., page 7, "... risk-neutral world."), and incomplete document editing (the Index listing for SDE is "See Stochastic differential equation" but there is no entry for Stochastic differential equation in the Index) - which casts doubt on the validity and applicability to a real-world trading environment 
 While "lost souls" had the unmistakable feeling of secretly discovering forgotten objects and finding traces of urban structures in the middle of a desolate summer field with your best friend while sharing chocolates from a lesser known ex-soviet republic, "some cities" has the feeling of your friend coming over to play gamecube and later call up people on the speakerphone seeing what's up, what's happening, maybe hooking up.  The evocative splendor of appropriately lined tracks 1 to 6 of "lost souls" is nowhere to be found here, yet is replaced by the efforts to sustain it of tracks 7 to 12, but with more giving up and less trying.  Is this a really bad album, does it deserve TWO stars? Well no, not if you don't rate it compared to it's first-most predecessor 
 DVD would not play. DVD stuck and would not go forward 
 I received both Stevie books for christmas. Like all the other reviews say, the pictures ARE the best part of the book. Some facts are not straight. These books kind of upset me, but like any other fan , I had to have them. These books do not offer any information on Stevie, so if you want some good pics, get them. But look for information some where else 
 This biography of General Winfield Scott is lacking from a number of perspectives.   First, there is a total lack of military analysis - the author merely states what Scott did but never in much depth and without an assessment of his strategy or tactical abilities.  We never learn how Scott evolved from a lawyer into a soldier - what was his military education, how did he evolve as a soldier over a 40 year career. How did he view new technologies like railroads and rifled artillery?  Second, Scott appears as a cardboard character here with little or no personal depth.  What were his views on subjects such as slavery, tariffs, the Indians? His family relations are virtually ignored - why did his wife spend so much time in Europe?  Instead, the author spends far too much time on Scott's political ambitions and his intra-service rivalries and bickering.  This is not what he is remembered for and should not be the primary focus for a military biography.  Scott was probably one of the best generals the United States has ever produced, particularly in light of the superb Mexico City campaign, and his generalship should be center stage in a biography, not low-level barracks intrigue.  Finally, the notion that Scott was the agent of manifest destiny is unsupported; he was a dutiful soldier, not an imperialist. Maps were inadequate to follow Scott's battles 
 Unfortunately, not much good to say.  I ordered this book with great anticipation, given my familiarity with the European and Middle Eastern high-end property markets.  The title lends itself to expecting a sense of a dynamic portrayal of the true passion, power and property of Manhattan.  However, the book read like stale bread.  I could almost smell the mothballs and the pungent cedar scent of the endless characters who are from an age gone by.  Where is the extended perspective and insight into the more recent property upheaval, the characters behind the scenes who pull the strings and truly make things happen.    Instead, were are taken through the hallowed halls of bygone era that smacks of a quasi-historical view of Manhattan's historical roots.  Why stop at going as far back as the 19th Century?  Perhaps Gaines would have done best to investigate the true Dutch and pilgrim roots of New York City.  When taking us into the present, or at least the recent past, there is only a very limited perspective of the very top 1% of the players, the movers and the shakers.  There is no intermixing of the various industries that together help shape the property market, nor of the machinations that inevitably get lost amidst the official stories that tend to make it to the social pages of the newspapers.  As a last note, Gaines, has failed to write a compelling book, written in an engaging manner that incites the reader to read further, with the excitement of getting a glimpse at the true Passion of Property in Manhattan.  Gaines has written a bland account that reads more like a tired summary of dates, events, names, and buildings 
 I've always liked John Barnes writing: Orbital Resonance, A Million Open Doors, PARTICULARLY The Man Who Pulled Down the Sky, just a long list of well-written books with excellent SF ideas. But about four years ago he ran into some sort of Block in his writing, and he's been doing brain candy for awhile. Gaudeamus, while having reasonably interesting dialog and at least one "indicated" character who is interesting (Travis), is so badly written that it's embarassing. By this I mean that it doesn't have any character development and the whole story is told by a hokey "reminiscence" trick, where Travis sits down and talks for an hour at a time, with all sorts of non-germane sidetracks. When the aliens show up, Travis and John (who is writing the adventure -- right?) are both drunk, which is supposed to explain any possible errors in the plot. The problem is that the "plot" just kind of passes by in a haze (...and then we saw the aliens land and they wanted to buy the Island of Manhattan! Ha, ha!) I hope John Barnes gets himself together again soon. I can't read this. (I skipped to the end to see what "happened": nothing.) Remember, I LIKE John Barnes, but some people reviewing this can't tell a non-plot when they see it and gave it a misleadingly high average rating 
 Albeit you'll learn many things about Area 7 & 8. Although you'll learn about chemical  and nuke weapons, this book's really boring. Each chapter begins with a persecution. So, how many persecutions could you read in a book? How many times the book's hero can save himself or being save by other person? At half book when you're still reading persecutions, you'll know that Schofield and Gant will survive. About the inexistent love story that of course is pathetic I won't write more. So if you like my kind of books (check my listmania! list) don't read this one 
 "The disciplined armies always kept on foot on the continent of Europe, though they bear a malignant aspect to liberty and oeconomy, have notwithstanding been productive of the signal advantage, of rendering sudden conquests impracticable, and of preventing that rapid desolation, which used to mark the progress of war, prior to their introduction." I assume this is a quote from the federalist papers. Nevertheless, I had some interesting thoughts from the passage and wish to expound.    Because a state's army is impregnable, or atleast its will, defense of freedom and welfare are not necessarily the cause(I derived that from the passage, and the rest will be questions which came to mind). How can someone hold an injurious intent towards freedom and to his or her nation's welfare while, at the same time, claiming to defend such things? Can people defend something for which they wish ill will towards? Maybe they can defend the nation but not the mentioned causes.  Brandon Williford Tulsa, O 
 I was so hyped to read this book ~~ really, I was. I thought, man, "When the Wind Blows" was really good and intense (and surprisingly, rather better-written than a lot of his other books) ~~ so I picked this one up and was hugely disappointed. I finished this book simply because I wanted to know how it ended. I kept turning the pages in hope that maybe just maybe that it would evolve into a wonderful story and all the questions would be answered.  I shouldn't have bothered. The first half was a replica of "When the Wind Blows" and the second half was just repetition of previous paragraphs; no depth to the characters and it was so poorly written, that I just cringe whenever I think of my English teachers struggling to teach decent grammar to their students. I learned absolutely nothing new. It wasn't suspenseful. It didn't provide any shocking revelations. It was just a disappointment. It felt like he was hurrying through this novel so he could write another one. Whatever happened to taking the time to hone a craft?   Anyways, this book focuses on Max and the other bird-children who have been snatched away from Frannie and Kit, whom they considered their parents. Max has a great secret and she knew that they're being hunted again. While living with their biological parents, all the children were separated, taunted, teased and made miserable by humans who didn't understand them. Longing to be with Frannie and Kit again, Frannie and Kit weren't even together. Frannie was still in Colorado while Kit was back in D.C., doing his job as a FBI agent. Max and Matthew were being hunted again for capture, so everyone got together to outwit the enemies who supposedly have this great secret.   If you're a die-hard Patterson fan, then buy this book. If you're not ~~ don't bother as it's not as good as "When the Wind Blows."   11-21-0 
 There are a few quite good letters here, but many of them appear to have been selected either because the writer was famous or the editor was just desperate to fill the book. Nearly all of them are from before WW2 and most are from before the 20th century. As a result, most of the letters have language that would seem very stilted if used today. But even old age doesn't excuse the writing that in some cases made me cringe 
 Owned for 2.5 years. Finaly broken. "The Conair often feels as if it is pulling your hair rather than cut it"- totaly agree 
 I thought I was getting a like-new book, but the dust jacket is worn more than I would expect.  I asked the seller for a small compensation due to their misrepresentation, but I never heard back from them. Be careful with this seller. 
 The setting of this book is beautiful, exotic, and interesting. The author, unfortunately, does nothing to take advantage of this. I am shocked that this book could possibly have won a National Book Award. It must mean that either the award itself is meaningless, or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year -- which I doubt. The topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else, as far as I am concerned. I can't imagine it being done worse! Tuck's writing style -- short vignettes or episodes, one after another -- is terribly ineffective and disjointed. I felt completely detached from all of the characters. I didn't feel like I gained any understanding of who they were, and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies. Another thing that completely irritated me were Tuck's sexual references. Throughout the novel, Tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter (a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest, for example). These sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader; all they did was gross me out. They were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy, not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story. I don't know what Tuck was trying to do in this novel. I think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level: It is not entertaining. It is not profound. It is not educational. It is not beautiful. At only 248 pages, I can't say it was even a quick read. Utterly forgettable, once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it. 
 This GPS ONLY work when you make no mistake/missing/stop/break/change on the route you set before you start driving. Suppose it would work on Marine, but didn't test it yet.   This GPS is for my friend. I've use others for 4 years and I do the testing on this one. I never expect it would be sooooooooo slow to re-calculate.  When you lost or miss a turn, it just frozen there and doing nothing for you lost. When you manually push it to re-calculate, sometime it's working, sometime it doesn't, seems all depend on if IT HAPPY and you don't trouble it. TOO SMART with temper, isn't it?  It may lead you to totally wrong direction. My friend drive out from Atlantic City to Philadelphia, set the destination to Niagara Falls; but he was confused on the toll bridge, then GPS lead him back to Atlantic City. He drove on Atlantic Express Way for a circle, till he realize by himself. It's totally wrong way to his destination.   It took so long to start. And in my testing, 60% of the POI is out of date. Couple of restaurant is closeout and one of it closeout 5 years ago. Well, seems it did a good job on record the history.   Probably I lost the patient to do more testing. At least it doesn't working properly as my old Navmin, even the map of it is also out of date. But I'm very satisfy for the speed to load up and re-calculate 
 I was very excited to own this album knowing that this was a jazztronica album from one of the ECM masters. After struggling to listen to this album several times I have to say Molvaer would do better to stick to the more straight ahead, or perhaps find another producer for such outings. The electronic textures and ambience are fine, and the playing is nothing less than you would expect. Really it's just the beats that make this album unlistenable to me. Extremely cheesy and extremely cliche. My friend commented to me that it reminds him of a 90's movie soundtrack. I think that's about right. Molvaer is a great player, but he's a bit out of touch with some of the genres he was hoping to capture on this record. For jazztronica I would go with Dave Douglas' "Freak In" or the aforementioned E.S.T 
 don't buy this item...I was cheated...now i am gonna send it back. Its really waste of your money. don't go by the price...i will never buy anything from this site 
 ok, I hate to say it, but this never grew on me, i grabbed it when  it first came out and, sadly,  still it's very weak.  I'm a huge Kool Keith fan and this is very disapointing.  By far it's his worst album.  He needs to get back with Dan the Automator or something, these tracks are boring and go nowhere, with a couple exceptions-- so if it's dirt cheap it's worth grabbing. This does nothing for me, I hope he gets back on track 
 This was my first Patterson book, and while I may still try some of his other works, this one was not interesting or gripping in my opinion.  The character development was weak.  The novel is full of twists in the plot, and has a few good moments, but the people seem too simple to really grab my attention.  If you have not read this author before, I would try a different book first.  I have heard that some of his other books are quite different from the books in this series. 
 BOOM BOOM man this album doesnt go well.  Well i may point out first this album is completely different from the good old santana rap where did u go wrong carlos.  srry  but the only funny song is track number 4 where it goes BOOMBOOMBOOM.  It makes me laugh especially when the guy raps cause he says like a bagel cut the bagel.  HAHA but really if u want only one good song then this for you but other than that buy some good old santana like black magic woman. I LIKE THT SON 
 (disclaimer: I am NOT big, I am actually quite trim but I'd like to keep it that way and therefore I use home workout tapes in between gym sessions.)  After you get through a solid 12 minutes of spam, clips, and advertising, you are finally presented with a sloppily thrown together, uncoordinated poor excuse for Pilates. Beginners (which I am not) would be lost altogether as the instructor doesn't demonstrate her steps. The mat work is marginally better but not enough for me to ever touch it again. Therefore, this tape and the other ones I also bought from this series in the same purchase, are going in the "Goodwill" bag.   
 This book was so simplistic as to be useless. I  was a travel writer for ten years and wanted to learn more about the nuts and bolts of the business. I didn't learn a single thing. What a waste of time and money 
 I've got this meter a month ago. I intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise, but I've never been able to do so! At rest, the meter gives a reading after several attempts, but often inaccurate. You have to stay still as a statue for 10-20 seconds to get a reading. Now I'm using it as an exercise watch/stopwatch 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 My brother bought this cookbook for me 2-3 years ago for Christmas and I have yet to crack it open. You can go online to the foodnetwork website and get all her recipes for free (but why would you???) after seeing some of her more recent episodes, I am ready to toss the book in the trash without even taking a glimpse of the inside. Her recipes scare me and I wouldn't feed half of what she makes to my dog. Don't waste the money. If you think you wanna try her recipes, print them free from the web first before you go investing money in her empire. 
 This picturemate has been a total disaster.  After printing just a few pictures the color on the photo turns to pink and yellow.  Put in a new cartridge and it will work for a few photos and then the color turns funny again. Not only does it not print many photos with a true color image, but it is slow and the cartridge runs out of ink after a couple dozen photos.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT 
 Too academic and nothing new to add to material that is already out there.Not that practical from a swing trader's point of view 
 This book is very good if you are going to be working as a personal assistant or for a very high level executive.  If you are an Administrative Assistant for anything other than the White House, a Hollywood star, or a top level executive at a Fortune 500 company, this book doesn't really relate to you.  I've worked as an Admin Asst for a large public company, a small manufacturing firm and a high school.  Almost none of the suggestions applied to me.  It was easy reading but really only applied to very high level or personal assistants.  Also, the author related how what she learned allowed her to move up the corporate ladder and even go into business for herself.  For someone who is looking to work as an Admin Asst for their foreseeable career, this book doesn't give you anymore information than you already know.  Not a bad book, but keep in mind who it's geared toward 
 This was the 5th book I've read by Jodi Picoult, and the one I liked the least. I was intrigued by the subject of the book, as I have been with all of the subjects she has written about. But, this story did not measure up to my expectations at all.   This book was supposed to focus on the question of mercy killing, and could you/would you kill someone you loved if they asked you to because they were ill and had been suffering for a long time. One of the main characters is Cam MacDonald, who is the sheriff of Wheelock, Mass. Cam's cousin Jamie arrives in town and promptly turns himself in to Cam, citing that he has just murdered his wife. Later, you learn she had been battling cancer for a while and allegedly asked Jamie to kill her. So naturally Jamie has to go on trial.   Well, a majority of the book turns out to be about Cam's adultery, which is annoying in and of itself. It seems like adultery is romanticized in this novel and made to seem 'ok' since, as you discover, Cam is disillusioned with his life and is only sheriff because he inherited the position and it's expected of him. Plus, the person he has the affair with, he has known a day or so, which is ridiculous.   Interspersed throughout all of this, almost seeming like an afterthought, is content dealing with the actual subject the book was supposed to cover.   I was very bored with this book, but continued to read it, thinking it was bound to pick up eventually. It never did. As it turned out, I ended up skimming the last 80 pages. If I were you, I'd pick another novel.   
 I enjoyed both the revival production and the revival CD of Chicago.  When they came up with the marketing ploy of a special 10th anniversary multi-disc set, this "Chicago" fan bought it even if the revival CD (which I already have) is part of the set.  The various artist disc of famous stars who have starred in the production in the last 10-years did not offer anything exciting or interesting in their rendition other than their famous names.  Worse, the documentary was not well presented and the clip from the show was actually just a teaser.  It is so sad because Chicago is now the longest running revival in Broadway history and they have decided to put up a forgettable memorabilia that "Chicago" lovers will not treasure in the years to come.  Such a waste.  To ironically paraphrase a line in the show, there was simply "no razzle dazzle".      
 Ordered 11/27 - Never received a single copy.  Not very fast is it?  SLOW COMPANY may be a better description.  Can I have my money back 
 Hatred is not a good way to try to get back in the lime light.  Read your books, saw your picture, and now I understand why you took such extreme tactics to get attention.  Get some talent 
 Let's be up straight and honest.  There is nothing really to recommend or like about this movie.  Shot on a shoestring budget way back in 1994, BALKAN RUNNER has a stiff and pondering script full of holes (like how did the hunky hero get unhandcuffed from the dominatrix's claws?), a talentless cast, and a score reminiscent of a 70s cartoon series.  Daisy White is certainly lovely as is Isabel Russinova, but their emotional range is that of a rutabaga.  Paced incredibly slow and with no exciting sequences to brag about, BALKAN RUNNER is one of those movies you've never heard about, and rightly so!! 
 Hey, look at my review title, I'm playing the historical race card too! Before we compare our pesky scorned eurocentric models and archetypes to Afrocentric 'black/negroid' models and archetypes, let us look at the basic 'historical/cultural' facts. First, the Egyptians, Phoenicians and Carthaginians which inhabitated the northern fringe of Africa and Asia, and did influence the Hellenes,  were Semitic/Hamitic peoples....NOT negroid....Eventually the black Nubians did rule over a later Ancient Egypt for a time, but this was past the cultural mingling  stages between the Hamitic Egyptians and the Ancient Hellenes.  Minoan Crete knew of the Egyptians. Crete never depicted the Egyptians with black/negroid features. If anything, they bore a slight resemblance to the Minoans.  This guy's farfetched theories do not add up, they are riddled with obvious contradictions and totally bogus assumptions.  Athena is Semitic before she is black. Though she had braided hair in some depictions, she was not dark in complexion or ample in the facial features. A straight nose, not a wide nose.  Better yet she was neither Semitic, or black...but Greek. Seeing it is the Ancient Greeks who worshipped her....NOT the Semites or blacks.            
 For such a slim volume - only 175 pages with generous margins - author Sonia Shah attempts too much in trying to explain the vast story of oil. She starts with the geological story of how oil is formed and the incredible energy-efficient punch it delivers. In her preface, Shah writes that in oil, we encountered "one of the most versatile, energy-intense substances ever known."  It's hard not to respect how harvesting this fossil fuel has transformed the world and literally powered global advancements including higher standards of living in industrialized nations uniquely positioned to capitalize on its enormous benefits. This "black gold" is primitive in nature and it spawned a brutal survival of the fittest contest in extracting and utilizing its resources.   But trying to explain the geopolitical story of oil is where Shah attempts too much in too short a format when describing the  forces driving supply and demand on the world oil stage. On Pg. 154, she states that the United States' invasion of Iraq was originally going to be called Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL) but was quickly renamed Operation Iraqi Freedom so that its "oily ramifications" wouldn't be discerned. Regrettably, this explosive "fact" isn't sourced despite her otherwise extensive footnotes. The "Blood for Oil" argument is a compelling and troubling one that demands a fuller and more rigorous vetting.  The important geopolitical story of oil deserves to be told, but isn't in this abbreviated format. 
 But ... maybe this book is required after all.  I mean, the last 3 books were written as if Stephen King threw in whatever ridiculous thought popped into his mind, so maybe we do need this to explain what the hell he was thinking!  One reviewer wrote in his review that this book is NEEDED, not something that you just want, so I guess I may be on the right track after all.  Now that I look closer, I see that this lofty Concordance was published in 2003, which means that it only focuses on the 1st 4 books.  Ah, the good old days, when the Dark Tower series seemed so good and before King's creativity was knocked out of his head when he was hit by a van.  It's true, you know - just compare the 1st four books to the last three and you'll se what I mean 
 I don't care what others may say about the capabilities of the director, producer, cast, cinematographer...nothing, and I mean NOTHING is capable of redeeming this sappy production. The scenes utilizing miniature buildings look like they should be under a Christmas tree, with the only good aspect of the film being the flying scenes borrowed from 633 Squadron. David McCallum is an expressionless bore, while the action scenes of the special bombs look more like elderly lawn bowling. Oh no! Look out Dave! When you bank your plane right your left wing is missing! Studio oversight or did they just figure we're all dumb enough not to notice?  I give it 2 stars instead of one only because of the fact the story actually involves the Barnes Wallis designed Hi Ball weapons that were an off-shoot of the bouncing bombs he designed for the Dam Busters, even though they were to be used on water. Laughable at best...skip it 
 This book seems very much like the authors' personal dating history.  For example, in talking about Libras, they launch into a story about how one of the authors was horribly treated by their Libra girlfriend, except that instead of using this as an example, they implied that everyone else's Libra girlfriend would most probably act the same way.  If you can take their specific examples with a grain of salt, on the whole the book gives some good advice.  However, if you want to have a lasting relationship after seducing someone, this is not the book to buy.  This book's advice is better for getting a one-night stand or short-lived fling.  For example, this book says that to seduce an Aries, you should make a bold first move.  This might get them into bed once or twice, but in the long run, according to nine out of ten astrology books that you picked up, this will bore them, as they need a challenge and prefer to make the first move themselves.  All in all there are some good insights in this book, but I would browse it in the bookstore instead of paying for it 
 I am ex US Army, National Guard and Army Reserve.  I did not expect to receive dress web belts made in China and Taiwan from an Army Navy store.  I have other belts made in USA that are heavier materials (belt and buckle).  The belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new!  I ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking I would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life.  The web material is very thin for a belt.  The buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in Taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in China.  They are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing.  I will not recommend this product to anybody.  After shipping this junk cost me $47.00 !   
 I am not a fan of Robert Kiyosaki.  I find his books superficial and much of what he says common sense.  While he introduces some worthwhile ideas, I don't think he develops them enough to be useful.  I also don't like the tone or context out of which this writer expresses himself.  I find that it comes across as unfeeling, manipulative and selfish.  I don't have anything against seeking out wealth; however, I think the means to that end is important.  In my opinion, this author ignores that important fact and at the same time does not supply the detail that people are looking for or need to achieve their financial goals.  In short, I think this book is a waste of money.  There are many other books that can give you more useful information in less space which is delivered from a more humane emotional space. 
 This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff 
 This book along with Graysmith's earlier book, "Zodiac" were the defining history of the Zodiac killer case of the late 60's and early 70's. Unfortunatley, Graysmith's theories and observations were later proved false and misguided via DNA, fingerprints and other important physical evidence. However, the author continues to lead the investigation astray and has even divised a remarkably stupid theory to circumvent the lack of a DNA match by stating perhaps someone other than the Zodiac licked the envelopes that the Zodiac mailed to the press.....??   Although the author is misguided and perhaps delusional, the books did make an interesting movie this year and for that I appreciate his misguided efforts 
 I remember, not quite four years ago, when this magazine actually had PC substance and catered to a sophisticated PC-oriented market. Now, it's thin, hollow, interminably off-topic and ad-choked.  
 The cover model (or firefighter) is beautiful, sexy, and provocative. One may think this video has much to offer. Well, no, it's not. Even if the mission and vision of putting together this calendar may be noble (Firefighter Fundraising - we often think back to 9/11, and the many lives we have lost, among others).   The video is boring and truly disappointing. It just doesn't flow and, unfortunately, it is not in tune with the message the cover is trying to send. If you feel generous you rather send a donation to the firefighters directly. Do not waste time and expectations buying this video. It's not worth it 
 I was infuriated by this "guide" to Pern. Not only is it not up to standard to the 1st edition, it's very inconsistent in its contents. The descriptions in the series books don't match those in the guide. The drawings of places, objects, animals and people don't match the descriptions in books and the previously published pictures 
 this book has a title that appeals to the heart of every parent, particularly new one and this is the only reason it gets sold. There is no valuable information in that book other that what is compiled from other books by prominent pediatricians. If you want to help your baby sleep, read Dr. Wisebluth book "Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child" 
  This book is very hard to read. It is not for an average person, more for doctors and other professionals. The whole book is written in 'doctor's language'. I wouldn't recommend it. It's now just sitting on my shelf 
 I'm a huge Jane Green fan, but I must say I am disappointed with her latest effort. The writing style almost drove me insane - every time I read a paragraph beginning with "For", I wanted to scream! I barely made it through the book, and only forced myself to finish as I kept hoping that it would take a turn for the better. I loved all her earlier books, but would definitely recommend you pass on this one 
 Got the Archos to be able to take it with me when I travel for work and have movies on my flights.  The recording with the DVR station is great, but in order to hear what I recorded in a quiet room I had to have the volume turned up to 99%.  Hearing the audio with any background noise is impossible.  I contacted Amazon and got a replacement, that part was great, but the new one I have to have the volume up to 80% to hear anything in a quiet room.  I also found the that for the jack out to TV you are required to by the archos cable as it has a different pinout than a standard cable that comes with your video camera etc.  Needless to say, I will be returning the ones I have an buying another hoping it was just a bad manufacturing batch 
 During a meeting with some representatives of the Southern Baptist Convention Robert Millet and his LDS colleagues were asked, "'Why don't you people just admit it: You worship a different Jesus!' My LDS colleagues and I spent the next half hour or so trying to convince them of our acceptance of Jesus of Nazareth, as set forth in the New Testament." (xi-xii) This is the goal Dr. Millet has set forth for A Different Jesus?  Robert Millet begins by presenting the beginnings of Mormonism as an introduction to their beliefs. On this foundation he then proceeds to discuss LDS theologies revolving around Jesus Christ in relation to (mostly Protestant) historical Christianity.   Chapter 1 tells briefly about Christ's pre-existence and the plan of the eternal gospel coming to bear. The second chapter looks at Jesus in light of secular scholarship, namely the Jesus Seminar. In chapter 3 Dr. Millet discusses a list of differences among Christians, the LDS claim to be the "one true church," and what doctrines Mormonism holds in addition to historical Christianity. In subsequent chapters he goes on to explain the LDS beliefs about Jesus Christ and salvation, and at the end has a chapter answering 21 of the most common questions he's been asked by non-Mormons.  In his concluding chapter, Robert Millet tells a story about a question asked of him by a theologian: "You are standing before the judgment bar of the Almighty, and God turns to you and asks: `Robert Millet, what right do you have to enter heaven? Why should I let you in?'... I would say to God: `I claim the right to enter heaven because of my complete trust and reliance upon the merits and mercy and grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.'" (175-177) The question that first came to my mind is, "Which Jesus?"   Well, the LDS Jesus that Robert Millet presents does bear some similarity to the Jesus that historical Christians believe in, but also has a number of important differences. "Jesus was the firstborn spirit child of God the Father and thus the recipient of the birthright of the royal family. As such, and in that premortal realm, he was the Elder Brother of all the spirit sons and daughters of the Father." (20) We are those spirit sons and daughters, literally. "We do not believe that God and man are of a different species." (117) They do believe in the Trinity, "But they believe they are three distinct personages, three Beings, three separate Gods." (141)  These important beliefs are at the foundation of the differences between the Jesus of the LDS Church and the Jesus of historic Christianity. Further, such doctrines about Jesus of Nazareth are, we Christians believe, contradictory to the revelation of the Old and New Testaments. Thus, despite Dr. Millet's insistence otherwise, the LDS do believe in a different Jesus.   On one hand, I found some things to appreciate about this book. Robert Millet emphasizes Jesus Christ more than he does Joseph Smith, which is a move in the right direction. Dr. Millet has interacted with a wide range of popular Protestant authors, which helps him paint a mostly accurate picture of historic Christianity. However, on the other hand, he manages to quote from every prominent open theist and just about all of C.S. Lewis' most controversial beliefs. He poses some great questions throughout the book, but then occasionally fails to really answer them. For example, after quoting from Matthew 16:16-18 he asks, "Did the Lord not clearly state in this passage that Satan would not prevail over the Christian church?" (52) Unfortunately no clear answer is even offered.  While Robert Millet affirms many things I would agree with, on the most fundamental doctrines of who Jesus Christ is, I cannot. Unfortunately I cannot agree with my Christian brother Richard Mouw, who states in his afterword, "I think that an open-minded Christian reader of this book will sense that Bob Millet is in fact trusting in the Jesus of the Bible for his salvation." (183) It appears that Dr. Millet is still trusting in a different Jesus; a different God, than the ONE of the Bible.  The book is well written, which is a testimony to Dr. Millet's prolific writing career. While it would be easily understood by most lay people, I'm afraid I can't recommend it except to those who have a firm understanding of the teachings of the Bible and a general understanding of the LDS General Authorities who are interested in learning about Mormon teachings. I am disappointed that a Christian publisher would print this book, thereby making it accessible to unsuspecting readers in Christian bookstores, as it is an outright defense of a Jesus contrary to the Bible 
 Dull, dull, dull. If I could have submitted a review and given ZERO stars I would have. Pointless 
 I had high expectations for this book but I was let down after reading the book.  Power eating throws a lot of information at you in a very unorganized manner for the first 200 pages.  There are many times when the author contradicts herself especially in regards to how much protein should be eaten.  And in the end there is a diet plan that is very confusing and unclear.  This is not a very usefull book at all and I would not reccomend it 
 As a beginning gardener, I was looking for a book that would spell out, in a simple, organized fashion, exactly what I needed to do to start a vegetable garden on my rooftop patio.  So, I went on Amazon and purchased this book, as well as "McGee & Stuckey's Bountiful Container: A Container Garden of Vegetables, Herbs, Fruits, and Edible Flowers".  Having read both, I would strongly recommend "Bountiful Container" over "Edible Container".  "Edible Container" may seem more appealing because it is full of color photographs, but "Bountiful Container" is far more practical and a true reference book.  "Edible Container" is largely anecdotal and may inspire you, but is frustrating if you're looking to have basic questions answered such as "what dirt should I use", "how often should I water", "what varieties should I plant and when", "should I use fertilizer", etc. "Bountiful Container" is so well-organized and clearly and concisely written that you can literally read it cover to cover (I did) and then you will find yourself coming back to it time and time again as your garden begins to grow. Swearing by the "Bountiful Container", I now how a flourishing garden full of lettuce, beans, squash, tomatoes, and strawberries 
 They should have titled it "Locked in the Arms of a Terrible Author." That would have been a more fitting title for this aweful book 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 Kate Moss?  That gawddamn rollerskate song?  Oh, no.  The spoken tracks are equally repelling.  There is really no atmosphere to this album 
 This map is small.  A good overview of Barcelona, but if you really want to navigate the streets by foot, you need a bigger map.  Though this map shows most of the streets, a lot of them aren't labeled.  You are better off just getting the Lonely Planet book and using the map in the back.  The only good thing about this map is that its laminated 
 HOW COULD ANYONE EVER SUCUMB TO WRITING SUCH AN INSURMOUNTABLE LOAD OF NONSENSE?!?!  A SEXUAL AFFAIR IS THE MOST IMPEACHABLE OFFENSE??? NOT IRAN CONTRA, WATERGATE, TORTURE, OR WIRETAP? Noooooooooooooo, it just HAS to be what the DEMOCRATS did, not matter HOW insignificant 
 The premise for this book had so much potential--examining cultural differences regarding time--but the execution was horrendous.  The wholescale condemnation of all things "Western," "phallic," "linear" and "masculine," and the unilateral and uncritical praise for "indigenous" cultures reminded me of a freshman in their first college seminar: juvenile, naive, and accusatory.  She praises what she terms the feminine and damns anything masculine.  I found this reductive and insulting.  I am an avowed feminist, but I believe this kind of devisive thinking to be harmful and destructive.    Furthermore, Griffiths is an awful writer.  She is cutesy, smug, self-congratulatory, and badly organized.  Her one thesis seems to be "clock time, bad!" and never moves much beyond that.  There are many other authors, such as Linda Hogan, who can write poetically and also politically, but Jay Griffiths is not one of them.    Avoid this self-important book and its hypocritical, accusatory author.  Direct your precious time elsewhere 
 I loved the original movie, and I love Johnny Depp so I thought this movie would be awesome.Wrong wrong wrong!! First of all, the child actors were horrible, well the Charlie and Mike characters were ok, but the two girl actors were the worst I've seen in a long time. And what did they do to Johnny Depp? He was so creepy and weird. I took my nine year old to see it in the theater, and even she almost fell asleep. If you really want a treat watch the original with Gene Wilder 
 ........from reading Danielle Steel.  Here's the book:  three bachelors meet three women.  They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.  BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.  I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.  Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.  My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.  THAT'S sad 
 I am a fourth year neuroscience major and found this book to be extremely verbose and boring.  The chapters are 50 pages long at least and the author continually digresses into random tangents so you're left bored and confused at the end of each chapter.  Do NOT buy it unless you want to be even more confused in your course than necessary 
 I'm about halfway thru this and trying to decide whether or not to sell it to a used bookstore without finishing.  I kept thinking, maybe it's me, maybe there's something wrong with my attention span that I lose interest in these stories half way thru.  They all seem too long, unfocussed. What they really feel like is novels that have been brutally hacked down to the maximum allowable length for short stories.  The quality puzzles me because I'm almost always happily surprised by the quality and variety of short sf I read in the zines.  I haven't followed this anthology over the years, but this particular edition, imho, shows bad selection and worse editing 
 I don't need "MISFITS" wannabe's in the good ol' united states so I definetely dont need some woah woah ooh crap sung in japanese! Buy Earth a.d., Static Age,Walk Among Us,Legacy of Brutality or hell even Evilive to see what these losers wish they were. Just cause your songs are like fater than hell doesn't mean their good 
 I am a recent college graduate, so the premise of the story was definitely intriguing to me. The beginning of the story was written in such a choppy and direct, yet appealing style that I was excited about the possibilities of where this book would take me. As the story went on though I found that the "twist" or "spin" that I expected the story to take never occurred. From the first chapter this book gets progressively worse until you are left closing the book in disappointment. I love Land's style of writing. That was the only thing that kept me interested just enough to finish this book. I would pass on this story, but I am interested in seeing Land's creative technique combined with a worthy story to go along with it. 
 After a promising start, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's 1944 effort plunges into a sea of MGM mediocrity with a ludicrous plot involving the attempted murder of a boy king. However, Chef Ollie's "Steak a la Oliver" is worth a few laughs 
 The worst book I've read (actually, I was listening to the audiobook).  The characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that I found myself YELLING at the tape player, "I KNOW, I KNOW ALREADY".  I couldn't stand the torture anymore, I didn't even finish it.  I have enjoyed some of DS's earlier work, but will not buy another 
 I had high expectations for this book, but I was disappointed.  It concentrated too much on digital systems, rather than broadening the definition of noise to cover the natural environment.  I lost interested in the last 1/3 of the book, and couldn't wait to finish 
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 This work was Brown's most succinct development of his theories regarding the elusive Johannine community and how its development can allegedly be seen in the Fourth Gospel and Johannine epistles.  In this work, Brown came to accept some key conclusions of his colleague at Union Seminary in NY, J. Louis Martyn, and retreated from many of the historical views of the Church, mostly for ill.  Brown believes that the Fourth Gospel and Letters were not designed to provide the reader with historically accurate information regarding the person of Jesus Christ or even necessarily his actual ministry activity.  Instead, Brown thinks that the writings instead reflect the exclusivist (though not completely sectarian) and beleaguered condition of the community decades after the historical events of Jesus.  For Brown, the Fourth Gospel in particular makes Jesus something of a spokesperson for the attitudes of the Johannine community decades later, so that Jesus becomes a pliable character that is made to fit the story the author(s) wants to tell.  As a result, the Fourth Gospel is accurate only to the extent that it accurately portrays the attitudes of those who wrote it.  It does not give us an accurate picture of Jesus himself, but only the Jesus of the author's own making.  On one level, Brown's scholarship is brilliant.  And I for one am willing to give Brown the benefit of the doubt in some ways.  I can believe that Brown was sincerely trying to rescue the Fourth Gospel in particular from the post-Holocaust garbage bin by relegating many of the hostile confrontations with 'the Jews' to the later attitudes of a community that eventually lost much of its identity anyway.  By doing this, Brown was able to exempt the historical Jesus from anti-semitism by saying that the accounts in the Fourth Gospel were not historical to Jesus, and that Jesus himself never said what the Fourth Gospel says he said.  This allowed Brown to say that the Fourth Gospel was still valuable, while taking much of the sting out of it and redeeming it from anti-semitic interpretation by relegating most of the Fourth Gospel to entirely situational material that is not normative on the church today.  The problem is that Brown's proposal is evidentially vacuous (as even he refreshingly hints at in the opening of the book) and methodologically flawed from start to finish.  First, Brown's proposal is, as Carson once noted, a stack of inferences heaped on inferences.  Brown's approach is essentially a structuralist approach, which seeks to develop a theory from entirely within the text with no external controls to govern whether there's any truth to what he's saying.  Structuralism as a literary method of interpretation has been rightly discredited rather thoroughly for over 2 decades now, and this immediately dates Brown's work and makes it severely suspect.  This is why Brown's approach is slowly on the way out in academic circles in favor of more synchronic approaches to interpretation.  The one external control Brown attempts to apply to his analysis is borrowed from Martyn's theory of the Twelfth Benediction.  This is the late 1st C Jewish benediction that allegedly threw Jewish Christians out of the synagogue for confessing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.  Both Brown and Martyn believed this was a critical event in the history of the Johannine community and explains the hostility with 'the Jews' that we find in the Fourth Gospel.  For Brown, we can find this tumultuous event in the Fourth Gospel because the writer(s) have imposed it back onto their narrative of Jesus.  The problem is that the Twelfth Benediction never actually says what Brown claims.  The 12th Benediction is just a rather generic condemnation of the Nazarenes (Christians) with no mention of putting anyone out of the synagogue.  In order for Brown to use this external control to advance his theory, he has to make it say what it doesn't clearly say at all.  Problematic to say the least.  In addition, his flawed structuralism allows him to develop a Bultmannian-like source theory without calling it a source theory.  Instead of various literary sources being smashed together in the Fourth Gospel, Brown argues that differing streams of Johannine tradition were smashed together so that the Fourth Gospel reveals the development of the tradition that can be fairly easily identified.  For Brown, this is the only way to explain how the Fourth Gospel can both repeatedly praise and condemn the world.  But again, there are no external controls to govern his analysis, and his approach is severely deficient in recognizing the nuances with which the author utilizes the terminology he does.  Instead of doing the hard work of syntactical and theological analysis, Brown opts instead to punt the difficulties of the Fourth Gospel to an untestable and unprovable source theory that presumes discontinuity as a methodological starting point rather than proving it evidentially.  This results in a circular argument where unity of authorship is denied to make way for a source theory that conveniently denies unitary authorship.  Such interlocking reconstructions that ignore the hard data in favor of softer inferences is methodologicaly deficient.  Lastly, this theory does violence to the text itself regarding such things as authorship and eyewitness testimony.  The Fourth Gospel presents itself as an eyewitness and apostolic account, and Brown, who once agreed with this, offers us no reasons why we should now follow him in backing away from this constant thrust in the document.  Instead, Brown now says that a writer, or group of writers decades later have put words in Jesus' mouth to make him say what they want him to say in order to deal with the later community's own problems and hardships.  But of course, the Fourth Gospel itself never claims this of itself, and in fact, claims the opposite.  This means that Jesus' prophecy in John 13 about a day when his followers will be put out of the synagogue is no longer a bonafide prophecy, but a later author's imposition back onto the narrative of an event that already happened, and then trying to pass it off as an authentic prophecy of Jesus to the beleaguered community it was written for.  In order to believe something like this with absolutely no evidence to back it up is to bring a presumption of guilt to the text that is hermeneutically unwarranted and intellectually flawed.    In the end, to follow Brown is to reach a conclusion in which the historical Jesus is not really available to us in John's writings.  We can know very little about Jesus himself from reading the Fourth Gospel.  The best we can do is learn about the community who wrote the document and was the intended original audience of the document.  This conveniently removes Jesus himself from the Gospel account, which allows us to do the very thing the author of the Fourth Gospel allegedly did - craft whatever kind of Jesus we want because that's the best we can do.  It's a very American approach to spirituality, but in the end, it stands opposed to the Christian faith and the apostolic witness 
 I purchased this used a few years back because I was always interested in the band though I had never heard them, I had heard ABOUT them , but never heard their music. It was a complete letdown. It sounds mostly like Kiss reject songs. It does have a nice 1970s production valkue to it, but the songs do not, I repeat, do not deliver. If this was the band's best of then I have to say the band was a complete waste of time. "White Lightening" is the only thing that resembles a good rock song, it has a good solid riff and chugs along quiet nicely, but the best song on the whole two discs is the re-working of "Walk Away Renee". If you liked this band when you were 10, then you are forgiven for having a soft spot for the group, for everyone else, however, skip this tripe. 
 I read some raving reviews about this book, but I admit, I was quite disappointed.  Factual, I'm sure, but it lacks details and tries to touch on too much without going into any depth.  Many other pregnancy books go into further detail 
 Robert Kennedy was my very first hero as a child.  Although I enjoyed to some degree the psychological portrait of the man, I was very perturbed by the author's contention that the Attorney General in any way engineered his  brother's death.  To suggest such a thing is to suggest pure madness as RFK  was absolutely devoted to his brother and often sublimated his own identity  during his Attorney General years so as to better serve his brother.  I  found that concept preposterous and completely without merit.   Robert  Kennedy was the only one of the brothers that I liked and I believed he had  a lot of personal integrity, moral conviction and certainly a brave one.   He met personal goals and was an extremely hard worker who had a lot to  show for his efforts.  In some way I feel this book trivialized his  political career. Robert Kennedy is an interesting man in his own right and  I think much more interesting than any of his brothers.  I really felt  somewhat disappointed in this book 
 I was very dissapointed in this book.  It talked about how food allergies make us sick with very few specifics and no real info on how to go about fixing it. There are no references, though many exist.  It is just an ad for their test.  [...].  Don't waste your money 
 WARNING!  My Oxford World's Classics paperback copy had pages of Thoreau's "Walden"  inserted after p.158 of the story "The Room in the Dragon Volant."  Missing are approx. 50 pages of the LeFanu story, so it's not like it's a bonus.  I'm letting Amazon know about it, but check your copy on receipt!! Very disappointing to not know what happens, kind of like watching a thriller on TV and then the power goes out, but the broadcast stays on so you miss the middle.  I do rate LeFanu's stories 4-5 stars though.  Really well-written page turners 
 Alright. Good Charlotte.  A band that's been through a few things here and there; a band trying their best.  I'm sorry, but.. What exactly inspires these people to make music like this? The fans?  The only reason for caring about these fans is money. It's all money, and that is one of the reasons that this band has had even the slightest hint of success. There is no originality in this music. There is no quality. There is no talent.  The guitar playing isn't very amusing, the singing flat-out SUCKS, the drumming sounds like an eight-year-old playing with drumsticks, and as for the lyrics: they're tacky, they're annoying, and they are very childish.  The fans of this terrible music are either:  A) Young children that discovered this band either from sibilings, listening to Radio Disney, watching MTV, or merely getting the damned album.  B) Poseurs.  C) People that like all music out there, or  D) People with a degree of mental retardation.  Please don't think I do not know what I'm talking about. I know too many people that listen to Good Charlotte, and basically all of them fall under those categories. I've listening to Good Charlotte myself.  And PLEASE, for the sake of everything GOOD in this world, do NOT think or reply to this with a 'well I bet the preppy stuff YOU like SUCKS!'  This all sounds sloppy and terrible, but I have to say what I mean and mean what I say, now don't I? And I'm not telling anyone what to listen to, but I'd suggest to show some self-decency by getting into My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, and/or Hawthorne Heights. (Not that I like those bands... They're just slightly better replacements for this garbage.)  Good day to non-fans. 
 This book, which won the 1926 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature, is a collection of stories about the Chinese told as if they were folk tales (however, I have later discovered  that they may not be true folktales but Chrisman's original stories). I  didn't really care for them and I wouldn't recommend them strongly for  children today. But, I'm probably in the minority with that viewpoint 
 I detest this printer.  I've bought quite a few printers in my day:  Lexmark, Canon, and have been quite happy with most HP's, but this was the pits.  The first one I brought home worked fine the first time but when I tried to turn it on the next day, it wouldn't cut on.  It just died on me.  I unplugged it, plugged it back it...then it worked for a little while before dying again.  This time for good.  I returned it, got another one...same problem.  Except this time it keeps going.  All I have to do is unplug it before each and every time I turn it on.  Nice, huh?    Now I'm browsing online again and I've learned my lesson for sure.  No more el cheapo models.  I'm at least going to shell out for a midline price with some heft to it that will last me a year or two 
 I used one of these with my son (he's 3, so it wasn't that long ago) but as I was getting ready to use it again with my daughter, I started thinking about what a pain the Floppy Seat was to use.  Getting it back into it's "bag" was such a hassle I used to just plunk the thing back into the backseat of the car after shopping... which made the convienent small-space self storage a waste of time and money.  This thing is named well, as it really is floppy- floppy to put into the cart and floppy to try to put away again.    I started reading reviews of other seat covers, trying to find a better option and I sure found it!  I was really hesitant at the price of the Buggy Bagg, but I could tell when I took it out of the box that it was worth the extra money!  I've only had the Buggy Bagg for 3 days and I am already thrilled that I spent the money on it... definitely worth the extra $20!  It is super-well padded and can really, truly be put into the cart with ONE HAND!  (The Floppy Seat needs at least two hands to go well into the cart!)  DON'T waste your money on the Floppy Seat- it's a flop of a product!  
 There is a certain pose in these poems, and it is quite effective as poses go, but Buddhism is not a pose, nor a cloak for anger, nor a disguise for preening, and these well-made poems have a hollow core as if the empty kettle had belched. Sorry. I had really wanted to like it 
 This book certainly wasn't what I expected, because I found very little similarity between the title and the actual content of the book.  Galpin spends the entire book discussing the basic concepts of how to organize and manage a change management PROJECT.  If your are scratching you head wondering what that means, the best example I can give would be that if you were considering implementing six sigma as both a standard within your manufacturing area and as a cultural underpinning for your company, the book will take you through the basic structure of setting up a project team to deploy the cultural side of the six sigma message.  If you want a book on project management there are much better volumes. If you want a book on change management deployment (a book I would love to have) this book will leave you frustrated since he doesn't spend enough time on culture, communication and resistance to change which I believe are the three major components that would need to be addressed to discuss true change management.  If you want a book on how to drive strategy down to operational plans (my reason for buying the book) then you are completely out of luck 
 Purchased five of these sets thinking they would be fun stocking stuffers.  Wanting to check out what I purchased, I opened one of the five.   The geodes are tiny (not as pictured).  It was like breaking open dirt-clods... that have a small empty space inside... but not crystals.  Maybe it was a "dud" box, but will probably be returning the other four. 
 I would not recommend this crib mattress pad.  I followed the washing instructions prior to first use, and the pad would not fit on the mattress.  When I tried to stretch the sides around the mattress, they tore.  Luckily Amazon took it back 
 I've read probably more than my share of presidential biographies and this book is probably the worst (as in "unprofessionally written") bio I have ever come across. Period. It's not the subject. It's Mr. Widmer's flippant, "terminally hip", straight-out-of-People-Magaine, style of writing.   What do I mean? Well, the first thing that struck me was that though the book is not very long -- which given the fairly obscure subject matter is understandable -- the rambling intro to this work IS long. We're talking someting like twenty+ pages!  I kept reading page after page after page of the intro and found myself wondering "Ok. So where's the actually book??" I mean, was the author getting paid by the word or something?  And the work itself...again, "flippant" is the work that pretty much sums it up. Ex-president Bill Clinton was mentioned more than once, as well as BC and his intern Monica L. were also mention (in a book about Martin Van Buren?), The sainted (to Mr. Widmer) FDR is also mentioned several times, likewise Hollywood's Steven Spielburg and TV-producer Aaron Spelling... yeah, I know. In about about Martin Van Buren?? But then, I just said these folks were mentioned in Mr. Widmer's book. I didn't say that had any thing to DO with the subject of the book.   In addition, there were terrible gaps/unresolved events in VB life that the writer skipped over. For example: The young VB, an up and coming legal eagle, goes to NYC and there hones his legal skills + moves in very lofty circles + became close friends of titans like Aaron Burr, etc., and then, we are told, that after 6 years of this that VB up and left NYC to become a law partner with this step-brother in some little town in upstate NY. The end. Huh??  A young, rising attorney moving strickly "Class A" social circles in NYC, suddenly drops everything and buries himself in the country? And there's no explaination by the writer. Probably b/c he doesn't know either.  Another example, VB's wife suddenly dies (She just dies. No accident, no illness, her time just ran out) and he is left widower with three young sons. What arrangements does he make for those children, esp. as he is now a mover-and-shaker in DC by now. Again, we'll never know. The three boys simply ***PPIFF*** off the radar and we (the readers) don't learn of them again until they are young men. Granted, it's not vital but it is a loose end, and it would go a long way in fleshing out the personal side of VB. Again, maybe the writer himself didn't know.  And so it goes....  The book is littered with things like this: dead ends, loose ends, and washed out bridges. This book isn't writing. It's pop journalism. Strickly "People" magazine school of journalism. I gave it one star b/c, heck, if you can pick it up for a quarter at a yard sale go ahead and get it, read it. Otherwise, save your money 
 Dear Readers:  This book is NOT for Streisand fans.   It's not even for anyone who deems themselves a lover of humanity.  For someone to claim that Steisand fans will love this book is an abomination and an obvious ploy to sell a book that isn't doing as well as expected.  Animonisity starts in a twisted mind such as Mr. Andersen must have, and then spreads throughout our culture and our world.  Ultimately it breeds contempt between people that ends in wars and desecration.  And I want no part of it.  If you don't think the one thing has anything to do with the other, give it a little thought 
 This is an altogether poor how to draw book that leaves a lot to be desired. Its meager introduction only contains a very haphazard list of materials without specifications or descriptions, followed by the most unhelpful step-by-step layout I have ever seen on a how to draw book. On the left pages it has a full-page color drawing of one Justice League superhero with a short history of the character. On the opposite page there are four progressive drawings on graph paper on how to obtain that finished image, as in copying the same previously presented image and not being able to create your own. There are NO instructions on how to go from one step to the other, and NO discussion of guidelines on basic figure drawing, head and figure proportions, movements or expressions, comparisons of male and female figure features, or perspective and foreshortening for backgrounds and figures, all of them essential issues to any serious cartoonist. It also lacks instructions on compositional drawings, i.e., drawings showing two or more superheroes interacting with backgrounds. This 32-page book also contains a 2-page presentation, a 1-page introduction, a 1-page conclusion, and 4 sheets (8 pages) of graph paper in the back, leaving you with only 20 pages (10 images) of superhero drawings, that is: 2 for Superman, 2 for Batman, 2 for Wonder Woman and one each for Martian Manhunter, Green Lantern, Flash and Hawkgirl. I would recommend buying any of the three Ty Templeton books on cartooning the DC comics universe first: How to Draw Batman, How To Draw Superman or How to Draw Batman and Other DC Comics Superheroes, to get your money's worth of everything missing from this book. Or, if you are desperate to draw the Justice League like Bruce Timm, try downloading some images from the Internet and practice copying them on graph paper, you'll probably do just as well or a lot better than by buying this book. This book is aimed for a 9 to 12 years-old audience, but even they will find the lack of instruction in this book frustrating, what it lacks in depth, it doesn't compensate in price or print quality. --Reviewed by Maritza Volma 
 This book pales in comparison to the Trish and Chris Meyer books (Creating Motion Graphics with After Effects). The tutorials are redundant and don't go beyond very basic concepts. I teach After Effects at a local college, and will not be recommending this book to my students 
 Maybe my expectations were not set accurately, but I wasn't looking for a touchey feely book that simply repeated the same silly message for 161 plus pages. waste of money and time.. now I am going to have to rush and play catch up with all the work I missed while spending quality time to read this dribble 
 I've been cutting myself since I was 14, now I'm 24. I'm currently writing my own book about self-injury and personally I felt this book was boring. I pushed myself to continue to read it and by the end of the book it ended up being just another book on my shelf.  I wouldn't recommend this book to people, self-injurers or non-self-injurers.  I believe the stories that were told within the book had a lot of the same storyline. I would've liked to have read different types of stories. The majority of the stories were about those who were abused. Not every self-injurer was abused. Some just had troubling pasts like myself that weren't able to cope with life.

 This propaganda is by a guy who tried to impeach Clinton while he himself had an affair. On top of that, Gingrich tried to PASS A BILL THAT WOULD GIVE THE DEATH PENALTY TO POT SMOKERS (people who brought 40 grams of weed with them over the border - talk about crazy). This guy shouldn't be in politics - he should be in a Siberian Labor Camp. He, like all Christian Fundamentalists, should just take his bible and his 'lord baby jesus' and shove it deep up his a**, because the rest of the country really doesn't want to hear the bells of theocracy anymore. Do we really want to put our nation in the hands of this antiquated nihilistic Jesus myth? I think not.  Again, this isn't the 'United States of Lord Baby Jesus,' and we as a nation should do everything in our power to prevent it from becoming so.   It's also important to realize that OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WERE NOT CHRISTIAN. They were deists which is akin to today's agnosticism.   George Washington's practice of Christianity was limited and superficial because he was not himself a Christian... He repeatedly declined the church's sacraments. Never did he take communion, and when his wife, Martha, did, he waited for her outside the sanctuary... Even on his deathbed, Washington asked for no ritual, uttered no prayer to Christ, and expressed no wish to be attended by His representative.  HERE ARE SOME OF THE MANY ANTI-RELIGIOUS QUOTES BY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS:  JOHN ADAMS - "This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it." - "The divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity. Nowhere in the Gospels do we find a precept for Creeds, Confessions, Oaths, Doctrines, and whole cartloads of other foolish trumpery that we find in Christianity."   THOMAS JEFFERSON - "I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology." - "Christianity neither is, nor ever was, a part of the Common Law."  BENJAMIN FRANKLIN - "Lighthouses are more helpful than churches."  - "The way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason." - "I looked around for God's judgments, but saw no signs of them."  - "In the affairs of the world, men are saved, not by faith, but by the lack of it."  THOMAS PAINE - "I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any Church that I know of. My own mind is my own Church. Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all." - "All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit."  - "The study of theology, as it stands in the Christian churches, is the study of nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it proceeds by no authority; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits of no conclusion."  Save yourself the money and do the research yourself.   THE PROPER ROLE OF A GOVERNMENT IS TO REMAIN AGNOSTIC.  AND REMEMBER, OUR FOUNDING FATHERS DID NOT BELIEVE IN JESUS. 
 I find that the text is far too basic and simplistic to go along with the pics, which are well drawn but boring.  The author's hints and tips are rarely related to the craft of drawing but rather are inane comments about  giving heroes a shiny pistol and villains evil eyeglasses.   In the end,  this book is a collection of pics and while one can learn from looking at  them and copying them, I think you're better off doing the same with  whatever manga or comics you have lying around 
 My sixth grader likes it.  It is extremely ordinary and easy to outgrow 
 I was expecting a lot more from these two CD's. It teaches you a few items of food, basic words like "Hello", Please" and "airplane" and even teaches you to ask "Where are the suitcases"... but then that is about it. I was really hoping for more... much more 
 Ming has a good idea: Take one basic "master recipe" and apply it to three or more different dishes. Fantastic! Applying general concepts like this is the basis of learning to be a real cook. I'm sure that the concept would be a great boon to many home chefs.   Unfortunately Ming himself is far too irritating to watch for long. His tendancy to be a smug, overbearing, know-it-all and impatient to boot render his show unwatchable by anyone but a Business School frat boy.   If this guy has a book you should buy it and skip the heinous alpha-male kitchen posturing (with a ceramic chef knife) 
 This camera has an attractive look and price but it does not take good pictures.  I bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter and although she was happy with it (she's happy with anything pink) I was very disappointed at the quality and functionality 
 The turgid, confused prose is a dead give away. So is the overblown praise for this poorly written book. The 5 star review from "the United States of America" has to be one of the authors. If so, then the call  for "objective" reviews from a postmodernist is ironic, as well  as amusing. Also ironic is the book's theme of exploitation---by relying on  a dated, superficial review of scholarly research, as well as sleazy pop  culture, the book itself appears to be a work of Western exploitation.  Except this time, it's the arrogant academics exploiting prostitutes,  rather than their male customers. This harsh, intensely narcisistic  diatribe may be good vita fodder, but it is not worthwhile reading 
 If season four saw Homicide:LOTS lose its footing, season five was the one in which it slipped and began sliding downhill in a hurry. Everything that was so brilliant about the first few seasons gets tossed aside here.   Gone are so many of the brilliant characters like Crosetti, Felton, Bolander, and Russert. The strongest characters who remain (Giardello, Pembleton, and Howard) are largely relegated to the background. In their places are the one-note Kellerman, the obnoxious Brody, and the grating Cox.   Before this season, the show was largely about the interpersonal dynamics of the squad room and how that added up to a functional police unit; in season five, each character is isolated by ever-more contrived personal crises. The newer actors bring hystrionics and annoying acting tics to a show in which subtlety and wry nuance used to take center stage.   Gone too this season are some of the best writers on the show, and their replacements show only the most superficial understanding of what make these characters tick. Bayliss, Lewis and Munch are caricatures of themselves in these episodes, and Giardello is pushed so far into the shadows it's suprising that Yaphet Kotto isn't just given a guest starring credit.   Oh, and the original, brilliant opening credit montage--with it's overexposed, gritty urban scenes and unsettling percussion--is replaced with a CSI-esque montage of forensic gobbledegook and bleating sound effects. The original perfectly encapsulated the mood of the show; the new one completely misses the point.  By all means, get the first four seasons. More perfect television has never been made. But only get season five if you can't sleep at night without knowing how Andre Braugher plays a person recovering from a stroke. Six and seven you can skip altogether 
 I was very disappointed in this selection.  Maybe a MALE football fanatic would find something appealing, but I was VERY bored!  Take me back to court, to the lawyer's office, to the judge's chambers,...just about anywhere but these bleachers!! 
 The joke was already over - and, to be truthful, it wasn't really that  funny a joke to begin with. Vanilla Fudge weren't really the worst of their  breed, but if you want one good Vanilla Fudge album stick to the most  recent best-of disc and take an amazing pass on this one, especially, for  any number of reasons - not least of which is, the best track on the album  ("Some Velvet Morning") is included on the newest best-of.  Unless, of course, you're masochistic enough to need every last side-long  cut of the 1960s (and if "Break Song" isn't the most  exasperatingly punishing of the lot, I don't know what else to say), or  sadistic enough to need evidence that the only thing Vanilla Fudge really  had in common with Cream was a name suggesting cool summertime treats. If  you're that desperate for the one original Vanilla Fudge album which won't  drive you out of your mind, try "Renaissance" 
 I am a vegetarian and my husband was suckered by this title because of my love for vegetables.  This book should be called vegetable LIKE--as a side dish.  First, she misses no opportunity to pimp meat/fish/fowl in this vegetable cookbook.  Second, it's not very good.  For a definitive and creative work, see The Passionate Vegetarian.  Or the Italian Vegetarian.  Lots of better books.    I relented and gave it one star because maybe it will cause some people to wake up and eat vegetables 
 His book is like reading only 10 pages in Lawrence G McMillan book on options. It is almost 1000 pages long.  This book is light reading, entertaining and explains in a simplistic way the concept of options.  I do not recommend using it as a first book before tossing your dough away in the  market.  He forgets to explain the most important secret.  How to pick the stock which you write a derivative on.  McMillan might be a bit too much on math but if you do not understand the math and the loss or gain curves you will loose your shirt quickly.  I see this as a nice first book to read but unless you got lots to loose or very lucky, you should read something that is a bit deaper into the math behind the transactions. Not sorry I bought it but I did not learn anything new since I have read other more technical volumes.  Its biggest weakness.....it does not explain how to pick the right stock you need to hit the jackpot... Well really none of them do but I just thought I would warn the beginner. vr amcco 
 Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does. 
 I devoured Barry Singer's "Ever After" in one sitting, and mainly because I was so pumped up by anger that I couldn't put it down.  Why on earth would an author write an entire book about a subject for whiche he has such clear hatred?  From what I could count, he liked less than five musicals between 1978 and 2004, and thinks that there are less than five people who can "save" musical theater.  Whether or not it needs saving is up to the reader, but he knocks the genre flat every chance he can get.  He seems to abhor the "standard" of what a musical is, pushing for anything that is remotely boundary-pushing, good or bad.  If you cannot appreciate the standard, how do you really know what is pushing the boundaries?  In "Ever After," the author makes it clear that either his poison pen or his utter disregard and malevolence toward an entire genre has written this book (without the benefit of an editor or fact checker no less), rather than a feeling human being who can see and hear when inside a theater.  Harsh?  Absolutely, but the book is written in such sweeping over-reaching tones, that's the only way to read it.  
 Hey, Mr. Kearney, let me tell you what I (and alot of other folks) look for in true crime books:  DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT THE TRIAL, GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND INFO ON THE PEOPLE INVOLVED!!!!!  PLEASE! This book barely had any background info on anybody involved in this book.  Instead it went over the night of Devon's murder, and other than a page or two hear and there, straight to the trial.  I disagree with the poster who thought the trial was probably 40% covered, instead I'd place it at about 75%, maybe more. And if that wasn't bad enough, it seemed like in the trial phase certain things were said over and over again. If you're into a blow by blow account of trials you'd enjoy this book.  As for me, I was so stoked to get this book, okay with the first part, started getting a little unhappy towards the middle, and finally I just gave up.  I couldn't even finish it. I don't think I'll ever buy another one of his books 
 I was so disappointed with this item. My son (who's 3) received this for his bday. The child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son couldn't do it. He ended up getting so frustrated, he broke down in tears! The noises the train makes are MUCH TOO LOUD! And you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track, which we do not have. I was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it's a Peg Perego. The manufacturers should've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it. Why couldn't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones? I put it back in the box and back to the store it went. 
 It's a long read, the characters are boring, and the ending makes no sense at all.  It is neither funny nor thrilling. It's just plain dull 
 This book is a decent story that reads fairly well, but the four most important words I can include in this review are "graphically depicted zebra sex."  Yes, you read that right, and yes, it is in the book 
 By far the dumbest, most confusing novel I have ever read. We read it in our Contemporary fiction class in College and we are now trying to get them to change the curriculm so we are never forced to read such rubbish again 
 This book is useless.  Atheists and Christians alike will find the loopholes in his arguments.  You get the idea that he is hiding something and not telling you all you need to know to take a position. The topics chosen make little sense.  I could not decide what his purpose was in writing the book.  On one hand I figured he wanted to discuss why Christianity is superior, then he includes topics of theology that do not seem to fit into that purpose.  Many of the topics I hoped he would cover, he did not.  I found it a waste of my time 
 What?  Ann Coulter was once fat? Brunette?  Well then that settles it.  No need to debate any of her ideas-she must just be wrong.  Can't help wondering what these authors look like 
 I got mostly through the intro of this book and was immediately infuriated.  I sent this book right back to the store.  In the intro, it says natural is better, breast is best, I am not going to pretend that my goal is anything other than to convert you to my way of thinking.  So hello?  Who exactly IS this thinking woman?  I don't think it's the reader because it sounds like they will be told what to think, period, end of story.  I do not appreciate condescending tones in informational books.  They make it emotional when I am purely in search of facts.  It's true, I have never done this before and I am not an expert.  But at the same time, I am not an idiot.  I can read and comprehend.  I can participate in discussions and form my own opinions and beliefs.  Thanks for being straightforward with me, but I didn't buy this book to see one point of view.  I bought it to see what my options were.  I firmly believe there is no one right answer to all of this, and I would like the leeway to see all the answers in a factual way to decide what I want to do.  I will do the best I can, but I will not be put into a mold, thank you very much!  Not any mold.  Not the modern woman's "give me drugs now" mold, and not the natural woman's "hypnobirthing" mold, probably not Bradley or Lamaze either.  I will decide what to pursue after I am finished gathering information.    I feel like it is CRUCIAL for women to get an overview of the various methods and to select a strategy based on whether it is something within their personality to do.  Otherwise, I feel like it will be a waste of time when everything goes down as one will have to work as hard to "do the method" while already be working hard to get babies out.   I would not recommend this book if you are on the lookout for multi-faceted, non-biased, factual information.  Intead, check out "The Birth That's Right for You" by Amen Ness.  That book really gives you the lowdown on the birth process and a lot of different points of view on how women might cope based on their personality.  It isn't a side-by-side comparison on the different methods, but it is a realistic starting point and is chock full of information to better help a woman understand what she is in for 
 In trying to counteract the perils of feminism in modern society without appearing too biased, Gilder goes ludicrously overboard by offering the "savage barbarian" thesis as an olive branch. In short, the all-consuming strength of the more societal and nurturing female is, according to Gilder, what 'straightens out' the otherwise savage and single human male. He offers as 'proof' such data as higher unemployment, mental illness, alcoholism, etc. among unmarried males. However, Gilder's claims---however beautifully written they may be---are not entirely accurate and are largely projections of his own philosophical agenda.    For example, unmarried people might have more of a tendency toward societal and/or psychological problems simply because their lack of socialization makes them more pre-disposed to such problems, not because they aren't married. You know, the fellow who doesn?t like people, who tends to be a loner, or who has never matured in maintaining *any* social relationship is not likely to get married let alone hold a job. In fact, Gilder fails to point out the epidemic of depression, alcoholism and other issues that can strike anyone----whether unmarried and ?barbaric?, or married with good jobs and nice families. Equally significant is the marked successes enjoyed by unmarried groups of males---countless hundreds of thousands who work as single professionals and choose bachelorhood for indefnite periods---perhaps as a ?trial? period to find a suitable mate, not to hunt for sexual prizes as predators. [Other successfull groups are liberated gay males who historically are among the more educated and higher achievers in society. I suppose that Gilder would respond by saying that gay men are less likely to be in the ?savage?category list and thus, more prone to toward culturization without the influence of wives. However, gay men are often just as sexually aggressive and masculine as their straight counterparts so where?s the inevitable barbarianism?] And what about the 50% infidelity rate among married men---many of whom have wonderful families and loving wives? Could it be that barbarianism never leaves the male, or that he is simply hardwired to always take part in the ?hunt?---despite the so-called powerful neutralizing influence of woman? Whatever the answers, Gilder?s grand over idealized scheme doesn?t seem to fit.    Another problem is Gilder?s notion that the primary subconscious motivation of intercourse is to bear children, not simply ?screw? around. But if true, then why do post-menopausal women enjoy sexual relations when they---and their body---know that children are not in the cards? Why do people often avoid, at all costs, the bearing of offspring via birth control and sometimes even abortion?     Gilder?s book is not without merit, as the idea of the nurturing female sensibilities counterbalancing the sometimes cruder and more aggressive male nature is probably somewhat accurate. And it?s also true that the push for women to act more like men has indeed made society a more crass and cruder place---but not necessarily because men are crass, but perhaps because women are acting less like women and losing the moral impetus of males to play more chivalrous and respectable mating roles? In conclusion, to simply assign all-consuming power to womanhood as the sole balancing act in society and to render, by default, males as pretty much hopeless brutes unable to change sans the influence of their counterparts *is* cynical, ridiculously sexist, and without any scientific basis whatsoever. [Imagine the reverse being written---that women would basically self-destruct without the presence of men?? A national outcry on Capital Hill would occur.] Perhaps Mr. Gilder might try a different tack that avoids trashing men, and sucking up to women as the master saviors of the human race 
 I subscribed to Food & Wine for a while and was continuously disappointed. The articles are on the superficial side and more importantly a lot of the recipes and product reviews are not as well researched as they should have been. I experienced more than one flop trying their stuff. The magazine tries very hard to be trendy and pick up the latest and greatest in the cooking and restaurant scene without being careful enough in deciding what is actually an important or meaningful trend rather than a fad. This magazine can't hold a candle to "Bon Appetit" or "Gourmet" 
 Jane Smiley's _A_Thousand_Acres_ had a great deal of potential.  It had a powerful plot (King Lear) that has been little-adapted in modern times.  Smiley chose an interesting and rich setting in her modern day heartland farm.  However, the actual execution of the book leaves much to be desired.  First and foremost, Smiley writes exactly like a writer who has just completed a college writing program.  She uses smart and subtle humor (one may say wit), metaphors and similes.  The problem is that one is conscious at each and every juncture that she is using a simile, a metaphor, or a quip.  While more seasoned writers might have woven beauty into readable text or else have chosen to complexify and engage a reader, instead she chose a middleground that is neither challenging nor readable.  The reader constantly is forced to swallow some rather ridiculous metaphors, all the while conscious that they are swallowing a textbook, but ridiculous, metaphor.  And while the plot taken from Shakespeare had a lot of potential, it was handled quite inexpertly.  Yes, Smiley chose the intelligent path and abandoned Lear about 3/4 of the way through (so that everyone doesn't die).  However, once again, she writes in a way that makes every reader -conscious- that she is adapting Shakespeare, and at times the plot seems ridiculous in its current setting.  Yes, she sheds new light (the protagonist is the Goneril-character, who was a Shakespearean antagonist) in a very intriguing way.  Yes, she invents new excuses for her behavior (former child abuse)... however, had she not tried so hard to make the reader conscious that she was adapting Shakespeare, these plausable interpretations might not have seemed -in-plausable.  All in all, a book with many potent seeds that were not sown to anything near their full value 
 If you're expecting comedy from this DVD, run away, and quickly.  The focus is on the discussions that go on back stage as various comedians, including Seinfeld, work on their acts, and try to build or re-establish their careers.  The dialog is almost impossible to hear at times, because they have music playing over it.  The result is almost unlistenable.  I bought it because I thought it was funny.  Out of the whole thing, you'll get about 5 minutes of laughs.  Spend your money elsewhere.  It's beyond me why Seinfeld, who is now MADE of money, thought it worthwhile to produce this snore fest 
 I don't for a second believe that Burroughs is telling the truth about his life -- but I gobbled up his other books anyway.  He's funny and there's something endearing about the way he writes -- yes he's gay, and yes that necessarily "colors" his worldview -- but talking about a job you hate, a family you loathe, and a partner who amazingly tolerates you are necessarily universal.  That said, he lapses here.  This isn't as approachable a book and the narrator is isn't so much funny as he is unlikeable.  By turns smug and arrogant, too much of this feels self-indulgent.  Chafingly, distractingly so 
 The book's premise was so promising -- how to find work that fulfills your higher calling.  The book just never fulfills that promise.  Just a lot of unmemorable writing about how you will be more fulfilled if your work is meaningful.  Well, that's not a shocker.  But how about some insight into how to find or how to create meaningful work.  For such a deep and spiritual topic, the thinking was very superficial.  The author merely rewrites what he has read elsewhere.  No new thinking.  Readers would be better off reading some of the books he recommends in his bibliography such as Flow and the books by Viktor Frankl.  I was also left with the icky feeling that the real point of this book was to sell you on his company's feel good workshops.  A real disappointment 
 This book has everything to do with cheating your money out of your pocket in whatever way the "master" can manage. It has nothing to do with actual financial market investing/trading. Beware of "master" of DECEIT!!!!!!  Give it a minus 100 stars. 
 Yawn...another self-help book (this one is geared towards the would be business leaders of the future.)  I had to read this for a graduate class and if it were not required reading I would have certainly quit reading it after the first few pages.    Leading with Soul is primarily a narrative tale.  That is, the bulk of the book is a tale about a fictional business manager named Steven Camden and his spiritual awakening.  Steven is feeling empty, depressed, etc. so he goes to this wise women in the woods where he learns to find his soul and thus be the best leader (and human) he can be.  (I know...pretty lame huh?) At the end of every section, Bolman sums up what is happening to Steve and what we can do to find our souls.    You have probably gleaned from the above description what kind of book Leading With Soul is.  That's right another annoying, fluffy, self-help book that appears, on the surface level, to contain deep insights but is really lacking in sustenance. It really made me laugh when the author mentioned that we are always looking to gurus and fads to tell us how to live our lives instead of looking inward.  (And what, pray tell, is Leading With Soul? Does Bolman really think that his book is any different from the rest of the annoying self-help fads?)   The suggestions in this book are nothing new.  You can gain the same insights from reading a book on organizational/industrial psychology.  People like to see their work as meaningful and worthwhile, to feel personally accountable for the consequences of their efforts, and to get feedback that lets them know the results....etc.   And for all this finding your soul business...let me sum it up for you.  There should not be a disconnect between your home life and work life.  You should not check your "soul" at the door when going to work....you should be your authentic self...look inward for answers..yaddy yaddy..self-talk mumbo jumbo...etc etc.  Get it? Now you don't have to waste your time reading this book.   
 WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER REA 
 I recently returned from Maui and used Frommer's 2005 along with another popular 2005 edition as a guide.  Both provided current accurate information on lodging and activities and the other guide provided consistently accurate information on restaurants but I was surprised by the amount of either out of date or erroneous restaurant information in the Frommer's book.  On one occasion we drove across the island for lunch at a recommended restaurant only to find out they are not open for lunch on any day.  We went to another restaurant for dinner partly because of a dessert that Frommer's raved about.  When we tried to order the dessert our waiter informed us they had not served that dessert in years.  On another occasion we selected a restaurant based on a few specific dishes mentioned in Frommer's.  When we arrived we did not find any of the items that interested us from the Frommer's guide on the menu.   I share some of the other reviewer's comments about how often the information is updated. 
 PROS: 1. John Corey is still a funny, memorable character.  CONS: 1. Very little suspense. The author's use of a doomed character's point of view--switching to third person--to tell the reader all of the hows and whys of the main villain's Dr. Evil-esque plan ("FIRE THE NUKE!"). Then, after we know everything, we get plopped back into the first-person, investigative head of Corey, who doesn't yet have the story solved. The result is predicatable and tedious.  2. The don't-look-behind-the-curtain (gratuitous?) use of the Ted Nash character, who makes a brief appearance at the end...despite having died in NIGHTFALL...and, uh, THE LION'S GAME. Why is Ted's appearance so brief here? Well, he admits to screwing Ms. Mayfield. Naturally, Ms. Mayfield opens fire and fills Ted with bullets. Presumably, Ted's dead for good now.   3. The politics of DeMille's novels has been present in other books, but it's never been this catty. Why is the nuke kook a right-winger? (Hey, why not?) I should have known when the jacket cover said the book "will challenge you to question everything you thought you knew about your leaders and your country." The only thing this book has made me question is how anyone can seriously be more worried about conservatives nuking L.A. and San Francisco than the real terrorists out there...the ones who want to slit throats and post the footage on the web.    4. Continuity problems from how the last book, NIGHTFALL ended...Corey and his wife seem way too disaffected by it all. Yep, they are bothered by 9/11, but they are both working their same jobs, apparently having gotten over the whole sickening coverup (witnessed via videotape) that the "accident" of the TWA flight 800 was really caused by a missile. There is passing reference to this, but not much. Apparently, a guy like Corey doesn't do much soul searching. He just keeps going to work. In realilty, it's hard not to notice that DeMille still doesn't know how to deal with the storytelling hole he got himself in with the last book.  Corey is really all this book has going for it. And, while in his capable hands the world will be saved from kooky nuclear schemes from kooky Republicans, he can't save this book.  I think I'm done with DeMille, for better or for worse 
 You dont need a book to tell you how to skate. You need to go to your local spots, and parks and watch people skate. Buy skate videos and figure it out. Skate in your driveway for hours on end. And most of all have fun 
 I'm such a big fan of Tori Amos and Kate Bush that I gave this album a chance to grow on me and really, really tried to like Charlotte too.  The problem is she sounds like such a knockoff of her influences all I can hear is her copycat style, no true depth or originality.  No offense to her fans but sorry, I have to agree with the minority here and say she needs to develop a little more of her own musical identity and stop sounding like her mentors.  If you think you like Charlotte but don't have all of Tori and Kate's work in your library yet, I suggest you start there. For now, I'll give Charlotte two stars for potential. 
 I love this film.  It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing.  I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used.  I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches.  In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture.  I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves.  I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print .  One of  the worst I've ever seen 
 At the same time I also ordered Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child which turned out to be much more informative and useful.  I was exhausted with my 3 month old waking up 5-6 times a night for the pacifier to be replaced in his mouth.  I would nurse him 1-2 times when he wouldn't go right back to sleep.  I couldn't bear to hear him cry and would always attend to him immediately.  Elizabeth Pantley's suggestions were really not anything different than I had been doing.  I tried not picking him up and he was fine as long as someone put the pacifier back in his mouth.  For my son's sleep problems her method really isn't feasible when you are so exhausted.  I strongly recommend Dr. Richard ferber's book " Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems".  This book made the most sense and informs you about infant sleep patterns.  Our very simple solution was to take away his pacifier.  It was hard for me to do but he was 4 months old at this point and I was desperate.  Turns out it was not anywhere near as hard as I thought it was going to be on him.  He cried for about an hour before falling asleep and I would comfort him in his crib every ten minutes.  It took him about 2 days to learn how to fall asleep alone without it and he has been much happier since.  He no longer has fragmented sleep and is much happier when he wakes up.  His book also explains how to wean them off of wanting to be rocked to sleep in your arms or nursed to sleep.  It involves some crying but not ignoring them.  As a first time mom I did not like the idea of ever letting my baby cry but after reading these books and my experience has proved that a little crying is ok and NOT harmful.  It is actually not in the best interest of your child after 3 months to always pick them up so that they never learn how to fall asleep on their own.  My son went from waking up 5 times a night to sleeping throught the night 8-12 hours over the past 8 weeks.  He is now 6 months old and sleeps really well. My experience FWIW 
 The content is good and it's easy to look up words, however this advantage is lost because the print is too small and the spine breaks immediately with normal use and the pages fall out. I'm not happy with this purchase.  
 I have no idea what people see in this book.  I had such high hopes, only to have them dashed by a collection of surreal 'huh?' stories -- turned me off Ian McEwan completely 
 Worst movie. I think this one is not near as good as the earlier movies. Broly whoops everybody, but goku at the end beats him with a regular punch? what happened to ending them with a spirit bomb or kamehameha? the music is actually really good. not worth $20. First 3 movies are the best. but, it is dragonball z. but this movie is long and boring, and that is why i give it a 2 out of five 
 I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through).  It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere.  I do not recommend this book 
 I love Al Franken, but these radio show bits cobbled together doesn't make for very good entertainment 
 I am a graduate student at the University of Harford. I havejust finished Intro to Neurophysiology. The text, Fundamental Neuroscience was definately not "FUN". The text was hard to follow, too many  unnessary details, and figures that were to complicated to follow. Also,  there was no space in the margins to take notes, and the summaries were as  weak in descriptions as the chapters. I gave the text one star because  hopefully this summer I'll have a lot of bugs to kill, a 100 bucks for a  fly swatter is a bargin these days 
 Peter Carey is a pungent and bold prose stylist, who never shirks from taking huge risks in composing his very wild and very Australian novels. He certainly found an interesting voice for Ned Kelly in this tale. It takes talent to make a success out of a novel ventriloquising the story of a 19th Century Australian folk tale (little known outside that continent), but Carey has managed it (helped, of course, by a second Booker). Whether you like the novel will depend on whether you go for Carey's choice of narrative voice. I find that highly articulate, erudite novelists usually mess up when trying to ape the style and tone of an illiterate narrator. It's so hard to do, lose all that natural flair and polished style.   Carey has Ned tell his story in an impassioned vernacular, pretending that Ned's narrative was found in several dirt stained, weathered manuscripts. It is Ned's memoir to his daughter, telling how he became a farmer, bushranger, outlaw and policeman killer. Personally, I found the tale surprisingly ungripping given the potential quality of the raw material. The jarring, monotonous vernacular was an assualt on the ear on every page. Ned has no knowledge of the comma (that item of punctuation never appears in his account) but unfaltering mastery of the apostrophe, with all its nuances - 'wasn't', 'isn't', 'they're' etc. Is this plausible?   There are moments of raw beauty, that capture Ned's hard fought and tragic life, and the wild Australian outback. But I found this a pretty shabby, failed stylistic experiment of a book to truly enjoy it. 
 Mr. Hicks has done a wonderful job in compling equations, however, he has missed the practical applications in compressed air and vacuum systems.  I initially used his theoritcal position on calculating pressure drop in pipe for compressed air.  His position seems reasonable and logical until you compare the results with practical applications.  Ingresoll-Rand, the air compressor manufacturer, published tables of pressure drop verses pipe sizes, delivery pressures and ACFM.  Futher ASPE has published a data book which leads the engineer into an empirical equation for calculating pressure loss in compressed air piping.  The results with both Ingresoll-Rand and ASPE agree.  Using Mr. Hicks' therotical approach drives the pipe size much larger than needed and therefore the cost of the project.  My suggestion is that Mr. Hicks contact I-R and ASPE to incorporate their empirical approach to sizing pipe for compressed air and vacuum systems 
 If you read the outside cover of the CD Audiobook, you get the impression that the volume strongly will deal with the manner in which FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt led the country during World War II.  However, what you get is more often innuendo about FDR's fascination with women other than his wife, whether his prviate secretaries, a visiting princess, or his mistress of many years.  Eleanor is covered in more detail than was expected, but she comes off pretty well, her husband's wandering eye notwithstanding.  Goodwin does provide some insight into the challenges of running the United States during the critical war years, but the amount of time devoted to private pursuits was not what was expected.  I had hoped for a lot more detail on the warimte effects of the economy, and the challenges it served the president.  I had hopes of more on FDR's handling of race and labor issues, but did not get it.  I had hopes of learning more about FDR's partnership with the Congress to achieve the nation's goals, but was disappointed there as well.  This was the first Goodwin book I picked up, and it didn't put me off enough to avoid her amazingly good Team of Rivals, about Lincoln and his cabinet.  Still, I remain disappointed that the book's cover and inside clearly focused on other issues than what was projected 
 Valuable as a reference work.  Don't read it for pleasure or relaxatio 
 That one day 4 year olds will be able to actually read this book. This book is not meant for kids aged 4-8. It is well beyond what they understand. Frankly , i don't even think a 4 year old can even read this. Nice pictures. But unfortunately , i don't enjoy buying a book for pictures. I can get pictures anywhere. I didn't need to purchase this book to get them. Anyway , don't buy this book unless you enjoy paying a high price for pictures. With regards to the age group. Unless you have a gifted 4 year old this book is a waste of time for him/her 
 What happened??! I have really been enjoying the Sneaky Pie Brown series - up till now. Found this one to be extremely disappointing and far off the mark for all the characters- they weren't very likeable. Conversations were too preachy and had little or nothing to do with the basic story line. There was very little focus leading up to how the mystery was solved, and  the condition in which the murder victim(s) were found, more graphic than it needed to be.  Ms Brown needs to go back and review her earlier books in this series and refresh her memory on why this series has been so fun to read. Jud 
 I love Massive Attack. I hate, with a passion, 'Hymn of the Big Wheel'. Come on! Poor Horace Andy sounds like he's hurling in that song! I'm really trying to like this compilation. Some songs are wonderful (Dido, Gorillaz, Morcheeba, Royksopp, Badly Drawn Boy, Chem. Bros.), but then they want to include Goldfrapp's 'Utopia', which is a brilliant song, but the track included in the Ultra compilation is some [bad] mix that doesn't even begin to portray the beauty that is the original uncut song. WTF?! I feel lightly ripped-off, like I've been had. So, I'm going to edit my copy of Ultra Chilled Vol. 1 and burn my own edit (and include the original 'Utopia') so I can at least enjoy the good parts. But seriously, it shouldn't have to be like this 
 Let's just be honest: this film is terrible . . . and not in the way that "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!" is so "terrible" that it's great . . . more like the way "Caddyshack II" is so terrible that the director should forever live in shame . . .  I was a kid when this film was released. And, while it was not particularly exciting then, it is insanely tedious now. It is a genuine test of patience . . . but with no pay-off what-so-ever.  Here's some potentially helpful information:  The slasher film can branch in two directions: supernatural (Friday the 13th II, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street etc...) and crime/revenge (I Spit on Your Grave, Friday the 13th, TCM, Scream, Urban Legend ect...). This one falls under the latter heading. And while realism can render a more potent effect ("This could really happen!"), this film simply fails to engage the viewer ON ANY LEVEL.  The goal of a slasher film is two-fold: to horrify and repulse. This does neither!! The "horror" element is non-existent: there is no point in expounding, since there is nothing to examine.  And, if you love gore (and who doesn't?) try another film. The "murders" are barely visible (literally) and so sloppy that they solicit no response other than a yawn. Many of the film's problems are technical: the cinematography is just horrendous. The entirely film is extremely underlit, the colors are needlessly washed-out, and the film stock is grade "F." And this, as you know, is not because the film is over twenty-five years old . . . the problem was always there.  There is ONE "good" moment in the entire film . . . when the school's "bad boy" has his head lopped-off and it clumsily thunks down the prom-court walk-way. Still, it is more comic-relief than genuine horror.  The soundtrack could not BE WORSE. I am not referring to the disco tunes (we accept those since this film was made at the end of the disco period), but the tracks made for the film . . . they sound like they were squeaked-out by The Carpenters. So, imagine lots of disco punctuated by lackluster, psuedo-thoughtful ballads (like the final song on the track). Words cannot explain how wildly offensive it is!!  Did I mention that Leslie Nielson has a meaty role (yes, THAT Leslie Nielsen from Airplane, and Naked Gun)? He plays a tough-minded principal who is tormented by the death of his daughter. I know, it SOUNDS funny, but IT'S NOT!! Trust me!!  If you dig watching unattractive teenagers "disco the night away," hey, this film is totally for you!! But if you are looking for a decent slasher film from the early middle-period of its reign look elsewhere (like Halloween, Friday the 13th etc...)  I'd be willing to get all Ed McMahon's Star-Search on you and give this "film" a 1/4 star. But it is an important milestone in the slasher sub-genre (I will not spoil the film and tell you why, though). So if you are a slasher enthusiast or a horror scholar, watch it . . . on picture-in-picture . . . maybe after a few drinks . . . on a day when the cable is out . . . on fast-forward! 
 Wow. Good thing I didn't buy this book.  Looking at all these reviews there seems to be two catagories of people who rate this book.  The normal people catagory and the bling bling people who cash in on this book only to recommend their own books. And when you look at their profiles and see what books they have reviewed it's very little. It's obvious people want to cash in the name of the books ("Men are from Mars....)  One reviewer talks about his sex drive being improved then recommends his own book.  Seriously, shut up.  We live in a society where sex sells and the idea of if you want to be beautiful you have to get this book.  Don't be fooled. This book is BS and you will feel bad because another diet didn't work.  There are better diet books out there. John Gray is just trying to cash in in the weight loss craze just like Dr. Phil.  AND if you truly want to lose weight and need discipline weight watchers is great. If you are reading this you are a smart consumer don't invest in this poser, wanna be diet book. 
 The ends are comming off this cable doesn't meet the normal Belkin standards 
 I read this book because it was supposed to be one of Heinlein's classics.  I liked several of Heinlein's early works and thought I'd try this one, although I heard it was controversial.  After reading it, I can see why.  I cannot recommend this book.  It is not a classic, and if it wasn't written by Heinlein it probably wouldn't have been published, and if it was published, would have been forgotten long ago.  Other reviewers state that this is a book that questions social customs.  I'm sorry, but stories about time travel in which the protagonist meets and beds his mother as a young woman are not questioning social norms, they are the rantings of a dirty old man.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' this is not.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long are entertaining, but they don't make up for the poor quality of the rest of the text.  I regret spending money on this book, and I really regret losing the time I wasted reading it.  7MAY06 - I've added to this review after receiving a few not helpful votes, because, in part, I was concerned that my original review was too terse.  My opinion about this novel has not changed.  This is a series of stories about the life and adventures of Lazarus Long, a man who has lived thousands of years and experienced, effectively, multiple lives.  That is, he has loved, married, and 'built a life' several times.  He has now grown weary of the tedium of life and is contemplating suicide.  The novel consists of dialogue with some of his living decendants as he tells the story of his life.  Stories, really.  Each major section in the book is a vignette in LLs life.  In theory, this was a very good idea for a sci-fi novel, but in practice, this novel is simply tripe.  There are several things that I really dislike about this novel and would not recommend it to anyone.  Like much of Heinlein's later writings, this novel explores alternate family relationship (i.e. a code for incest).  As I mentioned above, one of the vignettes involves LL travelling back in time to bed his mother.  Another relates a `complex' (i.e. sexual) relationship between brother and sister.  Additionally, most of the novel is dialogue between the characters, there isn't much action.  I generally view this as a strength, not a weakness, but in this case the dialogue can be classified only as mindless banter loaded with sexual inuendo and overtone.  The characters on Beverly Hills 90210 had better lines.  If you are looking for a good science fiction novel, this is NOT IT.  This is really a novel about alternate family relationships with some sci-fi elements (e.g. longevity and time travel) in the plot.  There are some who may find this type of novel compelling, but from my perspective, the author of `Starship Troopers' and `The Puppet Masters' fell a long way when he published this novel.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long, a collection of witty saying interspersed throughout the book are great.  Judging from the other reviews, there are many who find this novel appealling.  Just be warned that this novel is very different than Heinlein's earlier classics.  There may be Time Enough for Love, but most people don't have enough time in their life to waste on this silliness 
 I got this book super cheap at a sale, otherwise I doubt I would have purchased it.  Just a warning, if you are seriously interested in profound, complex work with Faeries, this is not the book to help you. Like the other reviewer wrote, is this fiction? She said she's done tons of research. Where? What books was she researching? Certainly none of the dozens of books I have read on the lore, history and past of this ancient tradtion. She makes no mention of ancestors, none of the different types of faeries (hives, trooping etc)...only focusing on the elementals, which aren't even the Faery in the body of old lore. No mention of the connection between the Faerie realm and ghosts (ancestors as well)....even though this is well known and documented throughout all cultures and times.  Her brand of Faerie seems to come from the post industrial realm of what people think Faeries are and do. Really a made up one. She has none of the beautiful and evocative poetry and words from well known old poets such as W.B. Yeats, Fiona MacLeod....or writing from the famous Robert Kirk...nothing whatsoever of any histrorical mention, not even folklore or ballads! Just qoutes from her horrible sounding faerie romance novel (from the many qoutes from it) Uhg and the artwork...pretty bad. One of the paintings of a "faerie king" looks like some cheesy calvin klein model, with one of his hands in his jeans to boot. I laughed outloud at this drawing. The only thing intersting in the whole book was her description of the Snow Queen.   This book is just bad. If you are a serioud seeker and what to really delve into the enchanted realm and way beyond I recommend The Feary Teachings by Orion Foxwood or Earth Light and Living World of Faery by R.J. Stewart. If you want to keep it lite and flit about the flowers and think you've somehow connected to something by just wandering around nature and building altars with glitter....by all means read this book 
 The Easy Rider soundtrack was tainted from the very beginning for two reasons:1)the exclusion of The Bands version of "The Weight" replaced with the far inferior version by Smith 2)The exclusion of The Electric Flags "Flash,Bam, Pow".  Despite these shortcomings the Lp worked. Now 30 odd years later it would seem that when and "Expanded" version was released the kinks would have been worked out. This however is not the case.  The Bands version of "The Weight" is included--on side two with a bunch of songs that have a lot to do with the 60's and nothing to do with the movie.  Why wasn't Smith's version of "The Weight" dropped alltogether and the Bands inserted in proper sequence as it should have been all along.  Additionally The Electric Flag is still missing.  What gives?  The first disc is the same as what was released 36 years ago and disc two is nothing more than a 60's compilation of songs that aren't even in line with the feel of the movie as the original Lp was--the reason the soundtrack worked is that it coincided so well with the film.  Overall this is a highly disappointing release 
 This is the story of Stingo, a 22 y/o aspiring writer in NYC in 1947 who meets a pair of lovers, Sophie and Nathan, at his boarding house and is drawn into their dysfunctional relationship, falling in love with both and witnessing their self-destruction.  Nathan is a mentally deranged and drug-addicted genius.  Sophie is a haunted Polish survivor of Auschwitz.  Her story unfolds as she confides to Nathan the awful truths of her unwillingness to join the Polish resistance, her eventual capture over a small infraction and her heart-destroying choice when she arrives in the camp--she must decide which of her children will live and which will be sent immediately to the gas chamber.  While Nathan and Sophie are both fascinating, fully-realized characters with terrible obstacles, Stingo, the narrator, is about as imbecilic a person as ever an author has entrusted his narrative to.  Despite his thirty or so years of perspective on the events of '47 which he is relating, he seems to possess little or no wisdom about them, no intriguing viewpoints about his life or his friends' tragedies, and his actions and attitudes at the age of 22 are so immature and superficial as to be almost unbearable.  The novel is far too long--it could be nearly cut in half and only benefit.  The narrative style is foolishly ponderous, far over-written, especially in the first half.  And in the end while the structure of narrator/observer seems like a fine choice in the abstract, the specific narrator and his terrible lack of wisdom only interferes with the heartbreaking story of Nathan and Sophie.  In the end, the narrator never even approaches the key question in my mind:  why did Sophie so quickly choose Eva to die rather than Jan?  A lack of true understanding of what would happen to the girl?  A blind panic?  A preference for her son, the sort of harmless preference many parents may harbor that is never important because we are never asked to choose?  It is this having chosen which seems more than the other tragedies to have really destroyed Sophie, and yet it's glossed over in the narrative.  In fact, it's followed by Sophie and Stingo having an endless night of 'fu---ng' as the novel would put it.  Really?  Almost hard to believe Sophie could get it together to have peremptory sex after her drinking and her terrible revelations.  She uses sex to escape with her lover Nathan, but it's hard to imagine this all-night sexcapade Stingo relates.  Could it be that Styron only knows how to connect people through sex?    How this could be considered one of the greatest American novels of all time is a mystery to me.  The potential is there, but only a truly talented, dedicated editor could have rescued the book from itsmany structural and linguistic failures 
 Reading the first chapter was the only time I actually enjoyed this book. Everything went downhill afterwards, when I realized this was just a retelling of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is a well-told classic, timeless, raw, and beautiful. Here On Earth, however, is just a poor rendition, very contrived, no spontaneity whatsoever.  The almost-complete cast of characters in Wuthering Heights is present in Here On Earth. I don't remember the names of the characters in Here On Earth but I remember their counterparts pretty well. There's your modern-day version of Catherine Earnshaw, there's the modern-day counterpart of her brother Hindley. Then there's the counterpart of Heathcliff! Surprise! Surprise! A foundling with a dark and ominous character! And then there are the neighbors: the counterpart of Edgar Linton (whom Catherine's counterpart marries), and the counterpart of Isabella Linton (whom the counterpart of Heathcliff marries). And then there's the counterpart of Catherine Jr (Catherine-counterpart and Edgar-counterpart's daughter), who falls in love with cousin counterpart of Hareton (son of Hindley's counterpart). There's also Nelly Dean's counterpart, and Linton Linton's counterpart, but that's all I'm going to say. Those of you who've read and loved Wuthering Heights, you know the rest.  It's a sad thing that this is the first Alice Hoffman novel I've read. I'm now inclined to ignore the rest of her novels. Maybe. Or I might be open to her other novels if I've finished reading all the other books I really wanted to read first 
 This is a beautiful book of photographs.  However, I was quite diappointed in the fact that there is very little text in this book.  The history of the building of the Chrysler Building is fascinating, yet explanations and descriptions are non-existent in this book.  One would have to buy another book to learn of all the facts, the building process, the "competition" with the Empire State Building, or the architect, who was never truly recognized and compensated for this magnificent work of art.  It is a nice book to add to a collection, but I would seek out a more comprehensive book to get a true and complete picture of the masterpiece of the Chrysler Building 
 We purchased this toy for our son last Christmas.  First of all an eight year old will not be able to put this together.  It might even be difficult for an adult.  When we finally finished it we put it on and it was having major problems.  The gears kept skipping.  We called the company to see if there was something that we could do and they told us "Well, really this toy is not ment to last"  a lot of help they were.  So over all it was a giant waste of money.  It has made it's final resting place in the dump 
 I wanted to be entertained but instead I was disappointed as a dog lover, and a lover of the short story.  I continued to read the book because I couldn't believe it could be that bad.  If you like dogs, don't waste your  time.  If you like short stories, ditto 
 This band has had some interesting moments over the years, particularly their seminal release, "Up In It", which featured alt.punk classics like, "retarded."  THey made an MTV worthy breakthrough with "Gentleman" but after that their legacy just sort of trailed off... This album yearns to be a come back album, along the lines of "Gentleman" but it comes up short in every way.   The main plus to this album is the funky, groovy drum beats and guitar hooks, but they sound dry and uninspired compared to earlier whigs efforts. Also, the lyrics are grating and monotonous.... you'd think he'd find something else to sing about after all these years, right!? If you are a die hard fan, then of course you'll want this album for your colleciton, but if you're new to the whigs, start with Gentleman 
 And I don't have that degree. Fortunately I do have advanced math and some engineering physics under my metaphorical belt, otherwise I would've been completely lost when reading this book. As it was I was only lost about half of the time.  All the elements of a good story are here, a mystery, interesting characters and conflict, but the author just doesn't seem to know how to pull it all together successfully. For every step the plot or character development advances, you're slapped with a load of technobabble. A little science is good, too much and you're writing a technical manual, not a sci-fi novel.  I really was intrigued by this mysterious artifact and what it ended up containing, and by the character conflicts, but overall it was just impossible to focus on any of that when trying to wade through yet *another* round of math/chemistry/physics lectures.  Give this one a miss, unless of course reading textbooks is your idea of a good time 
 A great deal of discourse has come out of the use of this book in my law class on the interaction of law in society, but I find it's use counter-productive to the forward-thinking goals of most academic institutions. Prof. Williams cannot seem to make up her mind on anything. She attacks Marxist lawyers, while at the same time advocating an affront to the bourgeoise, especially those without black skin (whites, Hispanics and Asians are all vilified to some degree in this book). While masquerading as a socialist activist herself, she then advocates a very right-wing goal of keeping each other in our respective racial boxes to keep order, even refusing to accept that she herself can be at once black, female and educated -- these three identities always appear separately for her. Her book is a regressive look at the future that denies the possibility of progress in race and gender relations. She is sadly unable to employ the power in her rights and instead prefers to wallow in a viscious cycle that refuses to recognize nuance, and prefers rather to assume racial categories, because they are simpler. Very few new ideas are presented in this racist, ethnically intolerant and misandric text and it is hardly worth a read, beyond the fact that it may come up in discussion 
 While the plot could have been worse, it was tremendously forgettable.  And while Shapiro used the Austen-era language well, could someone PLEASE get this woman an editor?  There were commas where they were unnecessary, and the absence of them when they were needed.  Sentences ran on and on and ON.  She would do well to learn that it's quite acceptable to use a semicolon, somewhere, anywhere!  I unfortunately cannot get past these egregious grammatical errors, because it made the book a headache to read 
 This is a horrible book! It should be read to inmates who get life imprisonment 
 These songs are definately for younger kids,but not even six year olds,younger. I do like "Achy Breaky Heart"Okay and I like"Hands Up" Alot,but most of it is for young kids. Good-bye 
 I remember liking this book as a child and I thought I could get this book for my daughter.  The board book has been so abridged that it lacks a lot of things that I thought were funny.  AND what about that "climatic ending" where the apples all topple - Not there! I wouldn't even recognize the wording in the board book as Dr. Suess's 
 i think Susan Sontag is missing the political nature of illness.  as far as i'm concerned there is a culture of blaming the victim in our society that is not limited to medicine.  the victim is blamed because the victim has little power.  the ill person is blamed because the tobacco companies are powerful, the oil companies are powerful, the sugar companies are powerful, the retail chains are powerful, the manufacturers are powerful, the health insurance companies are powerful and the governments are powerful.  they have armies of lawyers to defend them; they have armies of doctors, scientists, and psychiatrists to fabricate pseudo-scientific evidence to support their self interest, but the victim is powerless to defend themselves against blame.  this isn't about language, it's about politics of money and power.  language is only one of the tools that the powerful use to blame the ill, and victims more generally 
 I chose this book to get more information on running an S Corporation, and I've been utterly disappointed.  The author spends more time telling you the number of words in the tax code then on the meat & potatoes of the information.  The chapter on compensation was particularly void of any S Corp information.  Overall, I think there are far better sources available 
 Kuiper calls himself a reformer but he does a carefully worded job of making the Reformation look like a mistake.  According to him both Romanists and Protestants are linked by the Creeds.  He calls the Latin Vulgate "Jerome's noblest achievement".  Martin Luther attributed much of the errors in the Roman Catholic Church to Jerome and Origen, but Kuiper leaves such "tidbits" of important information out.  If you want to return to Rome and have "historical precedent" from the RC perspective for doing so, this is the book for you 
 This book is one of the most overrated books I've ever read.  Reading it, I couldn't help but feel that I would rather be grating my face off with a cheese grater.  If you want to read good literature, look elsewhere.  Firstly, the book is terribly long.  For what little happens, there's a whole lot of reading to do.    Secondly, the protagonist is ceaselessly annoying.  Grass does not create any kind of empathy for his protagonist (a tiny conceited dwarf).  Instead, he creates a character that is a selfish, deluded, and perverted murderer.  There's a reason why people banned the movie version of this book as child pornography.  Thirdly, the only compelling part of the story is the history which it does not treat well.  Grass instead relies heavily on desensitization (through mindnumbing repetitiveness) to disgusting set pieces.  Though this work is full of literary value as an example of magical realism (through its animation of objects and the combination of the fantastic and the real to create the uncanny), attempting to read this book outside of a literary study context will probably result in boredom, disgust, or both.  Gunther Grass's involvement in the SS should be enough to keep you away from this book, but, if you are steadfast enough to start reading anyway, I wish you luck in finishing this waste of time.  
 Kevin knows how to SELL a book, and he knows how to keep the money. He doesn't know anything about the subject he supposedly is writing about, but he knows what is most important to him: If he can trick you into buying this book with a money-back guarantee, you will tend not to return the book no matter how bad it is. And it is 
 The Summary (short version)  The characters...  Go to restaurants and drink.  Go to bars and drink.  Go home and drink.  Go to bullfights and drink.  Insult each other and drink.  P!ss and drink.  Go to sleep, wake up and drink.  Take baths and drink.  Have sex and drink.  I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises.  Summary (the long version) Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo.  I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read 
 This telplay is supposedly based on the possibility of an asteroid hitting the earth. That possibility is real, and many people take the issue seriously. One commercial film, Deep Impact, also included some real effort to "get it right". However, there is nothing in this film that relates to the real concern about asteroid impacts. This is pure fantasy and thus a turn-off to anyone who has thought seriously about this issue 
 This may be the most overrated book in network marketing.  Don't get me wrong.  John Milton Fogg is a heck of a writer.  This "fable" is truly an extraordinary read, filled with wonderful images and seemingly heart-felt sentiment.  A page-turner, the reader whisks through the story of a novice networker's breath-taking encounter with the Greatest Networker in the World.  From a Japanese Restaurant to a hot bath to a baseball diamond to an opportunity meeting, the reader really believes that he (or she) is learning the secret to true networking success.  As such, this book has been heralded as the "classic" for the industry. (I must confess that I once was a believer.)  It's easy to come away from this book after a first reading thinking, "so this is what I'm missing."  Fogg has a gift.  The problem, however, is that there is nothing that Fogg presents that truly helps someone "do" the networking business, and do it well.  There is nothing written in the book that justifies the feeling of discovery that the first reading bestows.  Moreover, Fogg presents no authentic insight.  Instead, this book is empty.  It promises a "secret," almost Gnostic, knowledge of the inner-game of MLM, but never delivers.  It certainly leaves the reader hungry for more; but hungry because there was no food in the first place.  This book, instead, permitted Fogg to craft for himself a self-styled persona of "networking expert," with his finger on the pulse beat of the industry.  What Dexter Yager did with Amway, Fogg tried to do with the industry as a whole.  Take a look at his greatestnetwork community.  (Yager, to his credit however, actually built a downline.  I don't think Fogg can say the same.)  The Emperor has no clothes.  There is little, if anything, in this book which is new or thought provoking.  It gives the appearance of substance, but appearances are deceiving 
 Yes, this is a supernatural psycological thriller... but far from a good one as far as I'm concerned.  I love these kinds of stories and I went to see this film with a lot of excitement... first because it has a interesting subject. Second because it has a great actor. I thought Denzel Washington would never associate himself with a bad script... but I was wrong.  But Denzel is always top notch. The rest isn't.  By now you already know the story. A good detective... a killer who happens to me a demon who happens to pass from person to person just by touch... the hunt... blah blah blah....  The script is idiot from page one. The killer (as we will see as the story develops) travels by simple touch. So... excuse me... why doesn't the killer passes to a guard as he is going to be executed??? I mean... The guy is sooo powerful (and mobile) that I find it unbelievable that he gets to be executed in the first place.  But... ok... let's give the screenwriters a break.  Somewhere in the middle of the film, the demon enters a cat. Ok... so he can enter all kinds of animals. Fine.  Later on, the main character learns that in order to defeat the demon, he must kill his body in a place where there is nobody around. His brilliant idea: the forest. Full of animals.  Was I the only one who did not know the ending before it came????  Want more?  In an interesting twist, the protagonist kills an innocent man and later on... his own brother. And no one will believe the truth! How is he gonna get out of such a mess???  In the world of storytelling, there are only two ways of getting out of such an impossibly difficult situation: EITHER the screenwriter is brilliant and finds a believable way to save his character from the master mess built by the screenwriter himself - so he should know! (and then we get some sort of positive ending despite everything...) OR something deep inside the protagonist fails and he loses the battle against evil (despite the fact that there was a way out).  First line of solution: Die Hard, The Fugitive. Second line of solution: S7ven, Chinatown.  We have none of that here.  Instead we have an evil god against a simple man (great starter for drama, right?) ...BUT the man gets weaker and weaker and weaker... and the demon gets stronger and stronger... to the point where we get the fact that the demon IS invincible long before he actually wins. And the great turnaround never comes.  Obviously we all hope he will be defeated... and that's why I kept myself seated all through the film... because if there was a way out... it would be brilliant. If the character dropped the towel... it would be thought provoking to say the least.  But no... the ending was easy and predictable. The screenwriter could not achieve one of the two possible lines of solutions. He wrote the first thing that came to his mind and hid himself under "The story ends bad" label. Without any depth.  Every villain has a weak point. It is up to the hero to explore it (may he loose or win). The only problem the hero faces here is a stupid lack of data. We have the data the moment the demon enters a cat. That's why we know how's gonna end.  What about the girl who helps Denzel? What about his nephew? Shouldn't they be part of the ending too? Don't come with the "this is an open-ending" kind of talk!  Do I sense a smell of desire for a sequel? Quick! Gas masks!!!! Or... as A.C.Doyle would write: "Quick, Dr. Watson, the needle!"  Despite a stupid screenplay. Denzel is always great. 
 This is a great system. The sounds is amazing, the setup is easy and the configuration of the system with it's 2 small but powerful speakers is fantastic. I own a number of BOSE products and needless to say that this piece of equipment very much lived up to my expectations of a BOSE system - for the first 8 weeks!  After 8 weeks of blissful enjoyment, the honeymoon was over! First, one of the speakers stopped working. BOSE asked us to return the speaker for replacement - which we did - leaving us with only 1 working speaker for 3 weeks.   Following this replacement, another 3 months passed before the second original speaker followed the same fate as the 1st! Again, we were asked to return the faulty speaker for replacement. 4 weeks passed and the replacement speaker arrived - unfornately it was the wrong make and model! BOSE were somewhat apologetic and sent us the correct speaker 2 weeks later.  A further 4 months of enjoyment followed before the base unit started to falfunction. BOSE suggested fixing our faulty unit, but after a protracted phone argument, they agreed to replace the entire system at my request! I was asked to pay for the $60 return postage to BOSE for the faulty system and again, another 4 week wait followed awaiting the replacement.  The upshot of all of the above is that I have been able to enjoy my system in full working order for 7 months since purchase 10 months ago, I have had to make 3 factory returns for replacement & exchange and the whole ordeal has cost me $60! Genuinely superb customer service.  At this point it is worth pointing out that not a single person from BOSE has ever been sympathic with my plight and I have been offered no compensation for my trouble - and why should they - I am a but one small customer whereas they are a huge multinational corporation!?!  Having just received my replacement system I am understandably keeping my fingers crossed this time although my confidence levels with the product are at an all time low.  Buy at your peril - you have been warned 
 Echikson is one of these writers who feels that if he was there, whatever he saw must be described as if it were the most important part of the story. And if he wasn't there, he'll make it appear as if he was. He applied the same technique to Bernard Loiseau's quest for a third Michelin star in "Burgundy Stars," a book about gastronomy that failed to show how anything was actually cooked or what it actually tasted like.   In this volume, he muddles two good stories. First is the family upheaval surrounding the sale of Chateau d'Yquem. Second is an attempt to pin down changes in winemaking style influenced by wine journalist Robert Parker. The former is a classic drama; the latter a Wall Street Journal feature. The timeframe of these two tales overlap, and Echikson intercuts the narratives to give some vague sense that they're somehow related. No way.  Worse, it's clear, time and again, that Echikson hasn't got a clue how wine is actually made, so he relies on gossip about the winemakers. A very frustrating book. Thin, bitter, stylistically simplistic. Ptui 
 While installing Norton Antivirus 2007 XP, a Norton message flashed that I must delete Webroot for MSN. I did it, and it resulted in crashing the session.  Tried first the paying phone support and gave up after 2 hrs wait. Then ried the online chat. The wait went on for 9hrs, started #245 in the queue and by now in lline at #59 I realized this was not the Norton I'd used for so many years, I ordered Kapersky anti-virus.       
 A book on AppleScript, written in 2004, that completely ignores topics "data sources" and "data representations" can hardly call itself a bible.  The problem with such books, that write from real-life experience, is just that. They miss the real-life experiences of the rest of us. This book asks use to shun the label that "it is just another book on AppleScript," but that is all it is. Even 800-plus pages of oversized print cannot justify the $60 price tag 
 While I agree with reviews indicating that the author has a beautiful style, I was tremendously disappointed at the lack of payoff in this book.  Yes, there are interesting situations, compelling descriptions... but the entire last third or so of the book fails to deliver anything worthy of the set-up prior to that. Did the author just get tired out?  Too committed to just tying up loose ends from the previous book?  This was quite a bummer as I wanted to like the book and had invested time and emotion up to that point 
 This book, Meditations on the Tarot, is for the ardent spiritual "seeker" what the Davinci Code or Harry Potter are for the common folk. All cater to the perennial desire to tap into the hidden powers seemingly latent in the cosmos and man via, what the (anonymous) author, "Unknown Friend" calls, "the authentic experience of mysticism, magic, and gnosis."  Even though the book carries an afterward by Cardinal Hans Urs Von Balthasar, it can in no way be reconciled with traditional Christianity based on faith and reason. The author attempts in this book to present a universal spirituality combining such genuine Catholic mystics such as St. John of the Cross and St. Theresa of Avila with the occult doctrines of such as Eliphias Levy and Louis Claude de St. Martin. This occult theosophy, as recounted by the author, is generally based on a supposed innate divine potential of man taught by the mythical Egyptian sage, Hermes Trismagistus, and the doctrine of "coincidentia oppositorum" or fusion of all opposites;above-below, heaven-earth, male-female, light-darkness, good and evil.   This is a fascinating and seductive book, however, caveat lector, all that is spiritual is not good or of God. Remember the 1976 words of Pope Paul VI: "Evil is not a deficiency, but a highly efficient spiritual being who is both pervasive and perverting. This is a terrible reality, but true."  Hamilton Reed Armstrong, AGDEI  
 When I first heard that 4 Strings would be coming out with another album I was excited. I had so thoroughly enjoyed their first cd that I had high hopes for this one. The first single was amazing! The day it came out I ran out and bought it. I must have listened to it hundreds of times, it was so good! I couldn't wait for the actual album. Then it came out...My excitement diminished. First of all, I realized that Vanessa was barely on the cd. You don't mess with a good thing! Vanessa's voice complimented the music so well! Then a second problem arose: the music seemed like a rehash of the previous album's music only this time with different lyrics. What happened?! The only relief I found in this cd was the track "Euphoric Eyes." It's the only track that doesn't make me want my money back. (even both versions of the title track "Turn It Around" make me angry. I advise getting the single, as it has the best version.) So here's my verdict: Major disappointment. Why, 4 Strings? Why 
 I happen to like sweet and funny romances including animals as pets, but this book was a huge disappointment.  For instance, the stories included one about a cat who was a person/witch in cat form, caused by a spell from an evil woman. It was ridiculous to me.  This book was more about fantasy/witchcraft than about cats.  I found it to be disturbing overall, as it was more scary/unpleasant than it was romantic.  In other ways it just seemed silly.  I am not opposed to stories about witchcraft,in general, but these stories seemed to be more about spells and evil-doers than about romance and kitties.  Not my "cup of tea."  I discarded this one 
 This book is a poor substitute for Thomas Sugrue's "Origins of the Urban Crisis." More sensational and less objective, Holloway's weak prose add very little to the important discourse on the fall of Detroit. At best, this book should be considered a supplement (with its unique sources) to more rigorous and thoughtful writings 
 I read the other favorable reviews of this movie and bought it. I was clearly misled. I have never written a review before, but after watching this terrible movie I felt it my civic duty to warn others not to buy it.   I love movies and have hundreds of DVDs. This DVD is among the worst I have ever purchased.   I generally love Anthony Quinn as an actor, like James Coburn as an actor and love pirate movies. However, this is the worst so called "pirate" movie that I have ever seen. The acting by all of the actors in this movie is appalling: it is flat and boring throughout. Every actor seems as if they are half asleep or drugged throuhgout the movie. The actors fail to convey a single spark of human emotion, drama or interest in the story.   This an instantly forgettable movie. The "plot" makes no sense and is entirely uninteresting. For example, 5 children are forciblly taken from one ship to another and kidnapped by pirates and all the while the chidren never come to the realization that anything has gone wrong or that their captors are even pirates!  Nothing interesting happens in any part of the movie. It is infinitely tiresome and boring. There is not a single sword fight, not a single cannon fired, nor a single sea battle (that is depicted anyway--one sea battle is supposedly carried on during the movie--but no part of it is shown).   Additionally, every actor in this movie remains constantly terrified of one thing or another throughout the movie. Despite the fact that the plot calls for the actors to be terrified, they sleepwalk their way through their parts failing to convey even the slightest credibility that the actors are capable of displaying any human emotion.  The movie begins with a tropical hurricane in Jamaica. During the hurricane, the house of a plantation owner is seriously damaged. Afterward the plantation owner decides to send his children on a sea journey of several thousand miles to England to live with their grandparents there--without either parent making any effort to accompany the children on such an arduous voyage. All of the children are boring snobs who are entirely unlikable. The children are elitist, obnxious, self-centered, spoiled brats throughout the movie who constantly spout doom and gloom and inflict misery and misfortune everywhere they go.   The plot has the actors stumbling from one misfortune to another and never has a redeeming moment. In the end, one of the children accidentally stabs a man to death and the pirates are all hung for it because the young girl fails to tell what truthfully happened. Defying credulity, Anthony Quinn goes to his death smiling and joking.   At the end, the children all return to their Patrician lifestyle as spolied little rich children playing at their father's plantation without another thought as to the deaths of the pirates or their previous (boring) adventure.   There is not a single memorable moment in this film. It is quite simply awful.   Don't be misled by the other favorable reviews:   DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVIE.    
 I debated whether to give this book 1 or 2 stars. At first I was going to give it 2 stars as I thought LKH did a better job with this book than she did with the ABVH book Danse Macabre. I settled on 1 star after thinking about all of the things that bothered and/or disappointed me about this book.   My biggest problem were the scenes with Sholto. I hated what she did to him which I'm not going to say because I don't want to give anything away. However, to me it seemed like LKH was taking the easy way out. She took away any "specialness" and made it "ordinary". The scenes between Merry and Sholto could have been Merry and AnyGuy.   There were many other disappointments for me in this book. I'm not sure if the deficiencies of Mistral's Kiss were magnified for me as I had just finished reading a number of books (the latest from Kim Harrison, JR Ward and Lynsay Sands to start) which, IMO, were head and shoulders above anything coming from LKH lately. 
        I re-read some of the chapters of this book, hoping to be able let her argument convince me that the way our homes are currently designed and geographically situated are founded on a sexist world view, creating significant detriment to society.  I am not certain she was much help though.  This is a pretty serious flaw since I am sympathetic to her thesis.  Her arguments in support of her thesis are disjointed and use out of date information.           One interesting feature of the book is that, where other authors would at most provide a couple alternatives or one encompassing school of thought as a solution, she briefly traces scores of possible alternatives.  Most are only briefly mentioned, enough maybe to urge the reader to search out more information elsewhere 
 . .If you could sue writers for false advertising regarding what they write on bookjackets, you'd have a great case against these two! This book rehashes old legends and stories but provides nothing new. In fact, it does not even provide a good synopsis of what allegedly occurred during the "experiment", providing only bits and pieces along the way. It actually sounds like an addendum to some previous work that assumes you have heard all the cool details, and provides you with a few coincidences that the authors assume support their case. A don't know much about William L. Moore, but I used to read all Charles Berlitz's books when I was a kid, as I thought the Bermuda Triangle made for some great stories. But as I got older, I realized that that's all they were. Charles Berlitz never made any groundbreaking discoveries while "researching" his Bermuda Triangle books, just rehashed old sailor's tales. I recall him during a guest spot on the "Larry King Live" program, and when I Coast Guard officer called in and provided known, verifiable details on some of his "without a trace" cases, Berlitz looked like a monkey. As a former Coast Guard Rescue Pilot myself, stationed for 3 years in Borinquen, Puerto Rico (one of the apexes of the "Triangle"), I can also assure you that it is quite easy for an aircraft or moderately sized vessel to "disappear without a trace", and that there is nothing mysterious about it. . .it's a big ocean! I witnessed the indistinct horizons and other phenomena, all of which had perfectly good explanations. Save yourself some money and avoid all books that have Charles Berlitz's name associated with them unless you're reading them for "entertainment purposes only" 
 I don't usually do fiction, but have picked up a few excellent reads in that category. This isn't one of the best. For those who prefer nonfiction, and who are seeking a concept of god they can live with in good concscience, check out God Without Relgion by Sankara Saranam. 
 This is the first Patterson novel I have ever read, and it is certain to be the last.  Most good authors draw the reader into a story by offering vivid descriptions and in-depth characters, but Patterson does none of that.  The author's writing style is akin to that of a small child's, as he uncermoniously plunks the reader in the middle of boring locales populated with one-dimensional characters.  Patterson then holds the reader's hand as he matter-of-factly recounts the explosion or gunshot du jour and then moves on without explanation, presenting a book written by a Ralph Wiggums-like child for immature children to enjoy.  How does the reader know Alex was scared? The reader knows because Patterson clumsily beats him about the head and shoulders with writing similar to the style: "The man pulled out a gun, Alex was scared, Alex shot the man and he was happy, and the man was dead."  Don't believe me? Simply graze through the book and find where the hero handily dispatches an arch-nemesis in a scene so brief and without fanfare I had to read it twice to make sure the protagonist killed who I thought he killed, or skip to the end if you prefer and painstakingly wind your way through a series of forgettable characters each deadpanning that he or she is responsible for the antagonist's evil deeds.  Quite simply, this author shows a complete lack of imagination and creativity and this book should be avoided at all costs 
 this movie was horrible. I can't believe I actually paid money to see it 
 I'm really disappointed in this book.  The overall premise was a solid one, that if you can buy (say) a DVD for $12, watch it, then resell it on eBay for $5, it really only costy ou $7.  The author goes into some of the history and theory of secondary markets, why they work, and why they are important.    Unfortunately, I just gave you the whole book.  He repeats the above 3-5 times a chapter for 10 chapters, and weaves in commercials for his own, drop-shipping company, claiming that only fools or hobbyists would consider selling things on eBay themselves.    I wish this book had been worth the time or money it took to read it, as the topic is a fascinating one, but instead I feel like I was duped into reading a barely disguised brochure for the author's company.  I cannot recommend anything about this book 
 Johnny Depp (Secret Window, Ed Wood) goes up into space with his friend, actor Nick Cassevettes (son of Director John Cassevettes, starred in Face/Off) and both of them come back, in tact although Cassevettes soon after at a party dies and then his wife kills herself. Theron becomes more and more suspicious of her husband as she finds out evidence that Depp might not be her husband, but get this, an alien and that the twins she's carrying in her stomach are aliens as well. Then, she's all alone when her Sister and other's wind up missing. Bland boring thriller offers too many things that really dont add up to anything and the finale is hilariously dumb. Depp tries his best to rise above material that seemed to of been remade from other good movies and Theron cant show her talents as she lets all the stuff crumble on top of her....she's done way better people and so has Depp. Also starring Joe Morton (Speed, Terminator 2), Clea DuVall (Ghosts Of Mars, 13 Conversations About One Thing), Tom Noonan (Armageddon, Knockaround Guys), Donna Murphy and Gary Grubbs (Tv's Angel). A failed thriller 
 This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.  Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.  Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as "harken" rather than "hearken"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention 
 Despite the word "Science" appearing about thirty-eight times and the covers depicting spaceships and moonscapes, fans should be aware that Gardner Dozois in on record as defining science fiction as "What I like..."  During his nineteen years as editor of Asimov's Science Fiction magazine, he stretched the definiton to the point of being meaningless.  So instead of adventurous tales of heroic astronauts exploring the solar system and positive stories about the promise and wonder of the near future, the reader instead gets bleak and "disquieting" (Dozois favorite word to use in the introductory blubs) literary experimentations that are mostly fantasy or horror, or I-have-no-idea-what-it-is-but-it's-not-science fiction.  Parents should also be aware that shortly before Dozois "stepped down to pursue other interests," Asimov's magazine was banned in a few high school and middle-school school districts for some semi-pornographic stories with inappropriate language.  This anthology contains stories in a similiar vein and of similiar quality.  
 I read this book with interest, and then read a review that made me realize that Haynes and Klehr may have played a little fast and loose with some facts themselves.  For example (taken from the review by Walter and Meriem Schnier), "when parts of Bentley's story are shown to be consistent with Venona, they are prepared to declare without any qualification that 'Elizabeth Bentley had told the truth.' They overlook the fact that the decoders of Venona used names and incidents from the FBI files to help make identifications and fill gaps - the very names and incidents that were often supplied in the first place by Chambers and Bentley."  Their review, which can be found online ...doscuments numerous instances of sloppy interpretations and selective omission of facts.  I suggest that prospective readers of this book read the full review for other examples of problems with the book's handling of material from Venona 
 This was the second book that I have read of the authors (after the readable Body Double) and I would strongly recommend that readers unfamiliar with Gerritsen (a talented writer) avoid this book and look at the later books.  This novel centres around the events in a small Maine town where the local kids have started random acts of violence. The town doctor notices the acts and works out the correlation between the violence and the strange happenings at the local lake.   I found that this was a poor mans Michael Crichton, made worse with the authors leaning towards adding the romance element into the book. It may be just me, but the book seemed written more like a movie script than a novel.  A readable book if you can suspend disbelief 
 More mindless dribble from a writer whom Amway helped make thousands of dollars by writing a book that is required reading for all new distributors.  To give you a hint, Amway is now on the web under the name of  to hide who they are; a website where you can purchase toilet  paper .         Nowhere does the writer talk about  the hundreds of lawsuits that have been filed against Amway, that most of  the money in Amway is through the sale of books and tapes created by  organizations independent of Amway, or the thousands of people deceived  every year.  Don't waste your money on this book:  instead read False  Profits by Fitzpatrick 
 What is being called the "paperback" version of A Short History of Western Civilization here is in actuality not the paperback version at all but another paperback book entitled "A Study Guide to Accompany A Short History of Western Civilization from the 1600's." Richard Sullivan is not the author of THIS book. On the order form and on the packing slip it says "A Short History of Western Civilization" but it is not!  If what you want is a study guide for half of this book then go ahead and order it.  If you really want the entire Short History of Western Civilization book, then order the HARDCOVER version 
 I think this may have grazed my top ten list of bad horror movies (it is right up there with movies like "half-caste"). This just redefined the word bad. It is defecation. The best way to describe this is to imagine an episode of the power rangers meeting an MTV boy band video: It has very bad acting, slow, generic killing scenes (each victim is surround by members of a boy band and smothered so you cannot see what they do to the victim) At least half of the movie is a generic music video (singing throughout the movie) You almost have to see it to believe it, and I definitely wouldn't recommend seeing it. This movie is the equivalent to getting kicked in the groin or going to the dentist. This movie will make you want to hurt someone, or vomit uncontrollably. It will make you want to peel your eyelids off with a fork. Oh and did I mention it was bad 
 I had heard alot about this movie when I was a kid. So when I saw it on DVD I though it would be a good time to see it. I was wrong this movie is Bad and Boring. My advice, don't boy this DVD! 
  The People of Sparks by Jeanne DuPrau is a horrible book that I would not recommend to people under the age of eleven. This story takes place in the city of Sparks. Lina & Doon have just lead the people of Ember out from underground. After coming to the city the Emberites are mistreated, malnourished, and misunderstood. So Lina goes out into the Empty Lands with a roamer that is looking for treasure. The Empty Lands are full of owls, coyotes, and other odd animals. There are also destroyed homes and buildings. Following this she comes back, and there is a large fight involving everybody. After that the climax is still climbing, and the most important part is ... I can't tell you!  	The above ground city of Sparks is an incredibly small city. The population is only three hundred twenty-seven and then to make matters worse, four hundred odd some people of Ember come to live with them. With food being scarce and people on the brink of war, Lina leaves with a roamer and goes to the Ancient City. This roamer that Lina left with is very rude, odd, and is looking for buried treasure that isn't there. When the roamer leaves, Lina leaves with the roamer's partner and head back to Sparks. When the two meet a new roamer, that is going to Sparks, they travel with him. The Roamer tells Lina the clues to the treasure, and Lina tells him that it is... I can't tell you, you have to read it.  	Truly, I thought the book was horrible, and weird because I don't like Fantasies, but if you like Fantasies you should read it 
 I have finally finished reading this book, and in my opinion, it's not worth picking up.  Many, many inaccuracies...with not much covered that hasn't already been published.  I was hoping this book would go into a little more depth about his life between 'The Big Trail' and 'Stagecoach'.  Things like how he felt about going to Paramount and playing 2nd lead to Johnny Mack Brown in 'Helltown',  or what was going on in his life when he decided to leave Republic in 1936, and try making non-westerns for Universal.     This book is more like reading a pamphlet about John Wayne, then any kind of biography.  And the title is a misnomer...the book covers his entire life, not just his younger years.   A real disappointment.  
 The books in not very complete in what it teaches you. It is fine for beginners, but does not meet the needs of advanced users. 
 Wouldn't recommend this at all, most of the songs are not the original recordings but Johnny must have redone them on a tired day in the studio.  Others are from live concerts.  Save your $$ 
 I just want to say "Please don't buy this vacuum" Here is why: 1. When I vacuum on hardwood floors, the dirt would shoot out from the back of the vacuum itself.  Make my job twice as hard.  It does not do that on carpet, though. 2. It is heavy.  3. The cable is short, and so I have to keep on moving it to different plug in the other room. 4. It blows air everywhere and so when I tried to vacuum my golden retriever's hair I decided it's better to use a broom instead. 5. It is not wide enough. You really get what you buy for a 'cheap' vacuum, don't expect much from it!! 
 Ancient Sanctuary throws lots of unique cards at us.  First, Fairy decks start to rise from the junk pile in the corner of your room.  Zombies finally have an 1800 attacker.  Machines have a mean burn monster.  The rares are something else.  Soul Resurrection is a Call of the Haunted except the monster goes into defence mode.  And it's only a rare! There is also Blowback Dragon, who like his brother, Barrel Dragon, has the same effect.  Instead of destroying monsters only, Blowback destroys ANY card on the field.  Zaborg the Thunder Monarch is also a plus to this set, destroying any monster on the field when summoned.  I got this 5 set and got Gear Golem, the Moving Fortress, Enemy Controller, Draining Shield, Zaborg the Thunder Monarch and Avatar of the Pot.  In other words, buy it.  This is worth the money 
 I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.    The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.  I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.  This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
 So I've got a bookstore, and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up. So why is it that I see so many positive reviews here? Myself, I thought the authentic feel was a definite plus, (much of the time I did feel that I was reading an ancient memoir) but as for being "a page turner," as somebody else called it, you've got to be joking. This book is one of the slowest novels I've ever read. I did it on audio book and I kept falling asleep. It was a lot like sitting in Driver's Ed. after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus. Creighton has written some pretty fun stuff, some of it even mildly thought provoking, but his is neither. Timeline and the two Jurassic Park books fit well into the whole "roller coaster of a book" thing, and personally I thought Sphere was great.  I realize that there isn't too much in the way of popular Viking fiction out there and so I suppose if you've got to have a Valhalla fix you could check this out, but I'd still recommend the Kirk Douglas movie "Vikings" over this book. Or maybe the book "Grendel" by John Gardener, which is based on the same epic poem. But this book just feels to much like a boring history lesson. 
 I appreciate Mr.Logsdon's writing abililty.   In fact, I was enjoying the book immensely until I got to the part about killing the raccoon, which happens to be the animal I wanted to learn to get along with.  I think the  title is very misleading.  I wanted to know how to get along with my  backyard neighbors, and not by killing them.  To top it all, he actually  gave recipes for raccoon dishes.  Like I said, it was quite enjoyable until  this part, but I feel there are much more pleasant ways to get along with  our backyard neighbors.  I don't offend easily, but this title does not fit  the entire contents of the book 
 Saw this one on television.   Vincent van Gogh was misfortunate in life and certainly crazy. The artist who portrays him does his job very well.  The scenery is breathtaking.  However the nudity  in the film is vulgar. The chaeracters are hard to identify with. Some of the scenes are disgusting.   Not going to see this one again 
 An incredibly jargon-laden work. Sadly, many of the contributors really have nothing to say and spend a long time not saying it. On a few occasions, however, some of the contributions really shine and remind one that not all of academia is populated by mediocrity 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 It's sad that people can get a record deal for beinga good kareoke singer. Yeah, maybe my fish can get a record deal: They "sing" in tone, can breath, but refue to lip-synch(I know it sounds gay). This is just sad because bands that PLAY THEIR OWN INSTRUMENTS, WRITE THEIR OWN SONGS, and PERFORM THEIR OWN SONGS can pretty much get almost no attention. Let's take the band King's X: Doug Pinnick (vocals/bass) is an amazing metal singer who can sing in perfect pitch and writes good lyrics about God (King's X is a Christian band); Ty Tabor (guitar/vocals) has some of the bestguitar solos you probably don't know; and Jerry Gaskill (drums/vocals) has some pretty complicated rhythm patterns...yet only like a few dozen people (I know a lot more people than that like KX; I'm just exagerating) seem to like this band. It's sad. If you want good music, listen to the band I just menioned (King's X if you weren't paying attention). (If amazon doesn't post this I will SERIOUSLY get POed! 
 Well, I have to admit that I am a self-admitted design junkie! I am familiar with most of the television designer/decorators out there and have a fair collection of books on the subject. The amount of real and useful information in this book could have easily be covered in a short magazine article. Nate is selling "Nate", not creative design, (like many others I'm sure, I was suckered in by the "image"...) Put side by side with Candice Olson's new book, which I also just bought, this one doesn't even register on the scale (and it's twice the price). Do yourself a favor and check out Candice's book first. It runs circles around this one for content, ideas, before and after photography and most of all really great design 
 This music is a rip off. All is borrowed to the 4 first albums of Marc Bolan playing under the name of Tyranosaurus Rex. Something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy.  A shame 
 While attempting a complete adoption resource, the authors of this book have only discouraging and incorrect comments for lesbian and gay would-be parents. This lack of professionalism taints the entire book 
 As someone who was absolutely blown away by 'Waiting' I anticipated loving this as well. I did read a pre-publication proof that I found used in a local bookstore, so maybe there were some big changes between the proof and the finished product, but I was very disappointed in this story. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are totally one-dimensional, and Jian, the narrator, is relatively uninteresting and one doesn't really care what becomes of him. Plus, while what happened to Professor Yang after the Revolution was horrible, i'm sure it happpened to many, many intellectuals, so it wasn't that out of the ordinary. Finally, and I don't know if this was in the final novel or not, there is a note from the author at the end thanking someone for 'seeing the potential for this when she first read it in 1988.' So, my fear is that this is one of those first novels that was rejected, and suddenly, when a writer has success (as with 'Waiting') their earlier work magically is worthy of publication.   Overall, not a great novel, but an interesting view of pre-Tiannammen Square China, and Ha Jin is a good writer, and 'Waiting' was SO good that this wouldn't stop me from reading something else by him, but i'd pass on this one if I were you.. 
 I have read every book written about Stan Musial. I felt when I read this one the author was only interested in finding all the dirt he could find on this most wonderful person. I grew up watching this man play baseball. But most of all, I grew up watching a top rated human being. I really don't care about his personal life since I have met him many times and I don't have to have a book to tell the kind of person Stan Musial was or is. If you want to read dirt, than read Ball Four. That will keep you busy. If you want to read about a true baseball hero, I would suggest you read one of the other books about Stan Musial. They are what you could call real baseball books, ones by people know or knew the game

 WORST PRODUCT EVER! Safety 1st should recall this item if they have any sense at all.   I'd like to smack the so called engineer that designed this infant tub.  My 10 month old son pinched his little privates so bad it gave him a blood blister. Yeah, OUCH!!!  The stinkin bar that goes between the legs slides in and out of place when the baby moves --SNAP! It pinches their private part.  Everything was just fine and then suddenly my son looked at me with such panic and then screamed and cried. I realize what had happened and quickly moved the bar.  OUCH! It still makes me grit my teeth when I think about it.   Horrible product especially for baby boys. 
 Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did 
 The rest of the reviewers wrote glowing responses to this book.  From our perspective, it could include more background and easily to understand steps on how to utilize some of the tools, techniques, and methods of compression.    Are there any other books out there for digital compression in more detail that take into consideration the latest technology issues that might have a bearing such as DTV, HDTV, World Wide Uses on legacy systems as well as state of the art systems 
 Covers several items but is somewhat limited.  Felt like it was more for a butler than a regular man.    However, it did have some good material and I did get good information from reading it 
 LUCKY FOR ME I DIDN'T PAY FOR THIS PUMP BUT THE HOSPITAL GAVE IT TO ME. I COULD ONLY GET TWO DROPS OF MILK FOR EVERY TEN PUMPS. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME. YOU WOULD FIGURE THE HOSPITAL WOULD KNOW IF THE PUMP WORKED 
 Another bunch of blather, in my opinion. The biggest stock market crash in history may be coming. IS probably coming, even. But WHEN, Mr. Kiyosaki, WHEN? In 2016? It might, but you don't know, the chairman of the fed doesn't know, the President doesn't know, no one does. You're guessing. All your books say you're a money expert, based on a questionable autobiography, anecdotes, and a gullible public. I don't think Mr. Kiyosaki gives very good advice. I'd prefer Andrew Tobias, Ben Stein, or God help me, Suze Orman. Sorry 
 Unfortunately, this book is only going to help you if you're a fat nagging religious close minded wife who's let herself go.   For the modern woman with common sense (and who doesn't have her man beg her for sex, for instance) this book is completely useless. I can think of a few women who'd benefit from it (church ladies?), but most of the things on this book are common sense to a well educated wordly woman. I also found Shaunti Feldhahn's way of writing very anoying...at the beggining of the book, it feels like she goes on and on about respect forever. I get it, respect the man, there's no need to say it 30 times with different words.  It was definitly a waste of money.   
 I read this book on the basis of a favorable review in the New Yorker.  I found, though, that the book was rather dry and predictable.  The one star review may seem harsh, but this book simply did not live up to my expectations.  Mr. Okrent should probably stick to rotisserie baseball 
 Imagine a ring around a star.  A ring shaped like a giant canal, with sides high enough to keep an earthlike atmosphere in, and a floor covered over with dirt and teeming with billions, even trillions of beings spread out over a surface area greater than all the planets in our solar system.  The very concept of Ringworld is so cool that it gives any book set there an extra star.  In spite of this, I give it only two stars, which should tell you how bad everything except the setting is.  First, there is the constant, and distracting, obsession with alien sex.  The concept of "rishathra"- sex between races- is mentioned at least once in every scene involving non-humans.  It is the focus of many conversations that do nothing to move the plot forward.  And when Niven describes it you get the distinct impression of a thirteen year old nerd trying very hard to be as blasï¿½ as James Bond.  ("Ho hum, the aliens are having sex, I've certainly seen this before, let's watch!")  Niven is thus entered onto the list of sci-fi writers who manage to make sex completely uninteresting.  Indeed, I'd say he's so bad at it that he might even dethrone Robert Heinlein from the top of that list.  Second, the plot itself is convoluted and makes very little sense.  The book jumps back and forth between a group of aliens who make a trek across the Ringworld and Louis Wu, a human trapped on the artificial construction who must battle to save it from a weird alien menace.  However, the aliens could easily have been eliminated from the book - as far as I could see there was no connection between them and the main Louis Wu storyline.  Not that the main storyline was anything to write home about.  The weird aliens were all battling each other for the privilege of saving the Ringworld, so I'm not exactly sure where the sense of menace was supposed to be coming from.  Add to that the haphazard introduction of a new character halfway through the book and the gimmicky deus ex machina resolution, and the plot entirely fails to deliver.  It should be noted that this is the third - or perhaps even fourth- book in the Ringworld series, so longstanding fans may not be as confused as the reader who is picking it up for the first time.  But whether you are a fresh reader or an old fan, my recommendation would be to stay away 
 It appears that the thesis of this book is that logical organization and structure in the laws of physics only goes so far down, that you reach a certain level where the nature of reality is intrinsically opaque and that even in principle there can be no further explanations, that things just are the way they are.  Further, at this level of opacity, the "givens" are very messy and arbitrary: there is no elegance, simplicity, and beauty, the heretofore goals of scientific theories. Instead, at bottom the universe we live in is a Rube Goldberg concoction of surpassing inelegance.  At this point, the author, Leonard Susskind, says there are two possibilities:  1. There is only one universe, the one we live in. In that case, these messy, seemingly arbitrary laws and constants of the universe must be deliberately designed to allow the development of intelligent creatures like us human beings. This follows the so-called "strong" anthropic principle: our very existence proves there is an Intelligence Designer behind all of existence.  2. There are unending possibilities in the laws and constants of nature and our universe is just one possibility. There is a "megaverse" that continuously spawns "pocket universes," each of which has a random set of laws and constants, and our universe is just one of these countless numbers.   How can we make a purely scientific decision between these two views? Until recently, a lot of physicists hoped that String Theory would be found to support the first scenario: there would be a single solution to the equations that would produce the particular laws and constants we find in our universe. This seemingly arbitrary and messy collection of too many constants and laws would actually flow from a tiny set of first principles that would appear to be inevitable. This would also get around the "need" for an Intelligent Designer. The universe would be the way it is because it has to be that way.  But, alas, the most recent developments of String Theory seem to be pushing in the opposite direction: String Theory seems to allow for an unimaginably large set of possible sets of laws and constants: ten to the five-hundredth power in fact! Among all those possibilities, one or more like our own universe would arise purely by chance, and once again there wouldn't be anything mysterious or supernatural about our existence.  Thus, Susskind triumphantly disposes of the need of a supernatural basis for existence no matter what, and if this book has any focus at all this conclusion seems to be it.  The attitude that is convinced by this kind of reasoning is called scientific materialism. It is commonly used in popular science books by atheistic authors. Now there is nothing wrong with trying to explain phenomena "all the way down," without bringing supernatural causes and "miracles" into the picture. That's what the business of science is, and we should always be suspect when the miraculous is used to fill in "gaps" that science is unable (at the moment) to fill (most often these reputed gaps are merely wishful thinking on the part of religious fundamentalists anyhow, especially when it comes to "disbelief" in evolution). But to conclude that there is no transcendent ground to existence just because we have scientific explanations for something "all the way down" is overstepping the bounds of science proper into scientific materialism, and that is the fatal flaw of this book and is a major reason for me downgrading it to two stars.  Just because a God may not be self-consciously involved in the selection of the most fundamental laws of nature in our pocket universe doesn't mean that it doesn't take the infinite depths of a God behind everything to provide "room" in the potentialities of existence for life as we know it to arise. The very fact that it is possible for something like the human mind to arise from the apparently "dead" material of existence speaks to a transcendent nature that is behind it all.  This is the point that everyone seems to miss who preaches like Susskind that because at bottom it is only a matter of chance that our universe has the laws that it has, there is no "need" for God. The very fact that human experience is possible, even with our laws at bottom the result of sheer chance among 10**500 other possibilities, this very fact requires there to be an infinite Presence that some like to call God. It is God's bottomless nature that allows such highly improbable universes as ours to come into existence in the first place. God doesn't need to bring any universes into existence consciously; he does it by his very nature, and most of them pop in an out of existence without God even being consciously aware of them: it's just something God does without having to think about it. But without this infinite nature, none of us would ever appear in any highly improbable, anthropic universe, because the potential would not be there.   Maybe a conscious God is not needed to produce bacteria. Maybe a conscious God is not needed to produce 10**500 universes for every one like ours. But God is a prerequisite for universes like ours even to appear. The miracle is that there is "room" for a universe like ours to exist. God doesn't need to concern himself with the overwhelming preponderance of abortive pocket universes that pop in and out of existence. The spark of his consciousness needs only to spring alive when a universe like ours happens along by sheer chance. Then he can take an interest and start persuading consciousness when it begins to arise to flow in certain directions, towards his own unlimited possibilities in depth and beauty. God then acts like a lure, drawing consciousness into his own explosive depths, and who knows how far evolution can then proceed, once the conscious God takes hold of it.  In presenting this "theistic" view of reality, I'm really doing no more than the same sort of thing that Susskind is doing, and that's the flaw of this book. I'm not presenting science, but Susskind is using the name of science to present an atheistic view contrary to theistic views that irritate him. All I'm saying is that his atheistic views are easily countered by alternative theistic views. In either case, those views are only going to be persuasive to those with corresponding spiritual experiences of the world. As for the science that Susskind does describe in his book, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, it has been far better explained by other authors such as Brian Greene. I was frankly bored silly by the last half of Susskind's book, whereas Brian Greene is fascinating throughout. 
 I bought this thinking "Failures due to normal wear and tear", which is checked on the checklist of items covered on the overview page, would include accidental damage such as dropping.  However the pdf indicates that (3) DAMAGE FROM ACCIDENT, ABUSE, MISUSE, INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN OBJECTS INTO THE PRODUCT," is not covered.  This is just an extended manufacturer's warranty.  A call to customer service confirms this - damage due to accidents are not covered.  Save your money 
 The CD is great... sound good on the preview, still waiting for the CD to arrive.  I haven't receive my delivery after ordered it more than a month ago, only an e-mail asking me to review the product and there is no response from Amazon regarding the delivery or delay, am I wasting money here? 
 ...because I have! In his book on ACC basketball. In some cases, he  didn't change a word....just repeated the same anecdotes. I am really glad that I didn't pay for this book because I would have been really angry about re-reading old material.  If you like reading about ACC basketball, and you haven't read Feinstein's verrrry similar book, you will probably like it.  If you like reading about Big East basketball when you're not reading about ACC basketball...you might like it.  If you think that the basketball universe is bigger than the ACC, the Big East, and Feinstein's apparent obsession with Bob Knight, save your money for another book.  It's too bad, really. Feinstein is a good writer. I guess the big buckets of cash he gets from each book he writes has finally caused him to lower his standards 
 We LOVE this monitor, but only when it does not have awful interference.  Unfortunately, in the evening for some reason the interference is really bad and all we hear is static off and on for hours.  We do not live in an apartment or townhouse (which I read was not recommended for this product), but we do have wireless internet. Only we aren't using it when there is static, so who knows...  I love being able to see my boy, but the static makes the monitor REALLY annoying 
 This started out as a good story filled with mystery and intrigue.  A little over halfway through when I expected it to really start getting good, it died.  This story dove faster than the P-47 in the opening.  The second half of the story waned and the ending had no closure. I hope future novels by these authors will learn by these shortcomings 
 For all the talk Stossel makes about how he exposed all that he claims to hate, he grants himself a nice big fat deal of a job at ABC. The only reason Stossel switched from liberal to libertarian was his opportunistic behavior. For all that he claimed to expose, it was the ordinary folks doing it for him while he stole the credit. Stossel would be better off exposing fundamentalists in the Arab world if he cared to prove himself worth anything other than a pile of dirt talking dirt 
 I had never read a Brother Cadfael book before this and I don't plan on reading any after.  This book was bland, boring and butchered the English language.  It was set in a sanitized version of the middle ages where everything sparkled besides, of course, the prose.  If you want to read a good book with similar elements, try The Name Of The Rose by Umberto Eco.  It's also about heresy, a mysterious book and a monk who investigates crimes during the middle ages.  However, unlike The Heretic's Apprentice, it's good 
 i loved all of the previous books by Alexander McCall Smith and looked forward to each new one, although the frequency of publications does make one question if his writing has turned into a pure money producing scheme. However this novel failed to develop Isabel in the manner that I have always viewed her character and has became superficial. To end as this does seems extrordinarily superficial to meet a mass market view of society, and reminds me of the second movie in the 'Back to the Future.' This novel destroyed Isabel for me. mar 
 How is it that Wolff's books get such great reviews?  I'm not going to rehash the negative points.  Search the reviews for the scant few that gave less than 4 or 5 stars.  I think there is some kind of "circle of friends" going around giving 5-star reviews and then going back saying that they found each other's reviews to be helpful.  The books certainly are not helpful. Reviewer SBJ400, while having some good reviews on other products, has basically cut and pasted reviews from one Wolff book to another and given them all 5 stars.  If you want to get started-out in weight training I'd suggest anything from the "Men's Health" line of products or anything that Lou Schuler has been associated with (even though he is no longer with Men's Health).  As far as I'm concerned, "The Book of Muscle" has been pretty much the seminal treatise on weight training for the past couple of years.  I've read probably 50 other books on the subject, and none of them has any information that one doesn't have in it 
 This and Mad Jack were stunning dissappointments.  Where are the fiery heroines, the ones with true pluck and spirit?  Why do all of Coulter's females become bedridden at some point?  What happened to the mystery?  There was nothing fresh about this novel.  The relationship is missing the brilliant spark that is so enchanting in many of her previous works--it seems lately Coulter is marrying off her couples earlier and earlier.  This story has been done to death by Coulter.  Try the "Song" series or the early Sherbrooke brides 
 This is a great book to read by the fireplace. After about thirty pages you can conveniently toss it IN the fireplace! This is the most boring, disorganized, pointless book I have ever read. I read it because it was recommended by Stephen King. If you want a good book, I would recommend looking elsewhere 
 Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists.  I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability.  This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others 
 Dave Barry's Bad Habits has comedy fiction writer Dave Barry trying his hand at the non fiction market.  Although he achieved quality work in this genre with later attempts such Homes and Other Black Holes, this book was clearly just cashing in on the success of his fiction with little effort put in whatsoever.  There's lots of references to Commies which either means Barry was extremely paranoid and brainwashed by his government of the time or he is retelling the same joke over and over again throughout the book, a joke that isn't that funny the first time and is really irritating when repeated and repeated and repeated.   Barry also insists on telling us his personal stories in this book, obviously the publishers had a word in his ear with future non fiction books as these stories are hardly evident in those books but unfortunately they are here and aren't that interesting.  Dave Barry can write some really good stuff, both fiction and non fiction.  Dave Barry's Bad Habits unfortunately is not one of those occasions. 
 This book belongs in the Fantasy section of the library.  Let's start with the question of Israel's borders.  Do some folks say that these borders ought to be the Nile and Euphrates rivers?  After all, Israel is kind of small.  Doesn't it need, um, a tiny bit more land?  Well, Israel may need a little more land.  But almost nobody is proposing anything like this.  I see very few Israeli politicians demanding even all of the West Bank, let alone all of Jordan.  And as for the Nile to the Euphrates, this is pretty much exclusively anti-Zionist propaganda.  There's a nice article by Daniel Pipes in the March, 1994 issue of Middle East Quarterly that goes into this in some detail, in case anyone cares.  Yes, we've seen propaganda before.  In the 1930s, some Germans claimed that the Jews were planning to take over the whole world.  Now, what do we see in this book?  What we see in this book is Chris Hedges quoting someone as saying that Israel allows state-funded religious schools to preach that Jewish rule should extend from the Nile to the Euphrates.  Is there any connection between this and truth?  Yes, there's a connection.  You see, in the Bible (in Deuteronomy), Moses says at one point that Israel's borders shall run from the river Euphrates to the "western sea" (presumably, the Mediterranean, but definitely not the Nile).  Of course, someone might want to ask a Jewish authority about what the Bible says.  It turns out that there's much more detailed material in the Book of Numbers, and that is what Pipes says religious Jews are taught is Biblical.  And that specifies a much smaller Israel.  In addition, it is quite a leap to go from Biblical borders, no matter how large or small, to preaching that Jews ought to rule such an area today.  Hedges is doing us a big disservice here.  You may want to check all this for yourselves.  In addition, Hedges has an exciting description of the Battle of Khafji (which took place during Desert Storm).  Some people who were really there dispute it, however.  You may want to check that as well.  We also see Hedges describe the behavior of Israeli soldiers in Gaza on June 17, 2001.  Now, remember that these soldiers are trained to obey orders.  Their superiors know that Israel can't afford unnecessary violence.  The soldiers are there to protect lives, not to hurt or kill others.  And in fact, it turns out to be true that in the fighting between Jews and Arabs, the Jews (as expected) have rarely been guilty of gratuitous violence.  On the other hand, the Arabs, who have rather different goals and constraints, have displayed quite a bit of bad behavior.  Nevertheless, in spite of logic and facts to the contrary, in this book, Hedges comes up with the following (as usual, I encourage you to verify for yourselves what the truth is, and you might want to start by finding out how many people died that day and who they were):  "I had seen children shot in other conflicts that I had covered - death squads gunned them down in El Salvador and Guatemala, mothers with infants were lined up and massacred in Algeria, and Serb snipers put children in their sights and watched them crumple onto the pavement in Sarajevo - but I had never watched soldiers entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport."  Well!  What is it about Israelis that could lead them to behave in such a surprising manner?  Hedges speculates that exposure to all sorts of nasty reading material about the Holocaust has perverted these unfortunate young men.  Well, I'm perfectly prepared to believe that men and women from all nations have been exposed to all sorts of reading material.  But I don't buy Hedges' absurd conclusion at all.  Nor do I buy any of what he says about the behavior of the soldiers.  And no, I'm not in denial.  If you believe Hedges, I think you may be in denial, though!  I'll stop here.  Anyone capable of saying what I've quoted from Hedges so far is capable of saying anything.  We readers do not need this. 
 Expecting a romance type story, it's needless to say I was somewhat disappointed that it did not go too much into the relationship.  I was even more put-off with her constant whining about things that did not go exactly how she pictured.   There are so many unanswered questions that I wondered if she bothered making a seconded drafted of her story.   There is too much whining and too little about the people around her, especially about Fredrick.  I think she expected too much and did not give enough of herself.  True, there are some funny moments, but to put it bluntly, I'm glad I only checked this out of the library instead if buying it like I was intending to.   
 This book is an inspiring read with lots of good examples. The main strengths of the book are its passion and  advocacy of integrity, values and taking people with you when you manage major change. Otherwise it is now very dated as a theory of leadership. It came out originally in the late 1980's when management was made the scapegoat for US industry's lack of success against the Japanese, hence management is never mentioned in the book. At that time, everyone was calling for leadership to replace management without asking whether management could be upgraded to be less controlling and stifling of initiative. Ever since then, management has been consigned to the bad guy role - Theory X, transactional and initiating structure while leadership got all the good guy work - being Theory Y, transformational and showing consideration for people. The result is a bloated, unfocused concept of leadership with the leader as hero who has to do everything. Their top-down conception of leadership is also old fashioned as it makes no allowance for bottom-up leadership which, because it is limited to challenging the status quo, has nothing to do with managing people. We really need a reinvented concept of management that allows it to be facilitative, supportive and inspiring too as it is in sports for example, but that's another story. The fact that this book is still so popular is revealing because it shows we have not moved on in leadership theory over the past 25 years 
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters are unlikeable except for Charity's two friends. The songs are far too long and I had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull. I was especially disappointed with Big Spender because I love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from Bob Fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar. The only redeeming factor was that Sammy Davis Jr. was in it. He's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid. This was my first Shirley MacLaine film and on the back it said that Sweet Charity was her best movie. I have no desire to see her other movies then 
 hair dryer worked good for about 1 year. Then the switch broke, fused in the open position.I would not buy an Andis product again 
 Out of all... the dynasty....did not sit well for me!!!....but he came back with a blast from blue print 1 
 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
 The product I recieved looked just like the picture. It shipped very fast and when the product wasn't exactly what my husband was looking for (he is kinda picky) The company had no problem with refunding my money. I reccomend the seller to anyone. Very easy to work with! Thanks a bunch 
 Is it me or is it the film?  I watched my copy of the special edition the other night and there were words missing from  the dialogue in various parts of the film.  Now I wish that I didn't give my gold version away 
 The cover blurb made this book sound amazing; if only it were as complex and fulfilling as it sounded.  The book is very dependent upon Katherine's character, yet she simply didn't mesh for me.  She didn't come off as dangerous or interesting; she sounded more like any immature, impulsive, hard-drinking twenty-two-year-old. And the plot seemed bogged down in a "Groundhog Day" scenario, the same scene happening over and over.  There were snippets here and there that showcased talented writing; I agree w/ the other reviewer that Sabina Murray seems more suited to short stories. Over all, the book seemed poorly edited, with no real cohesion or feeling that the plot was moving forward 
 This book dishes out a lot of information in the small space between it's paperback covers.  I read it looking for film lighting basics, and had a tough time grasping some of the more technical language involving exposure, T-stops, etc, even though I have a decent background in photography. The book does a poor job of addressing and explaining these key concepts.  I gleaned a decent amount of information from the pictures and diagrams, but they were poorly aligned with the text, requiring lots of flipping back and forth. All in all, I would reccommend this book only to people with a fair amount of knowledge of the physics behind photography and/or film. 
 While the memory foam in this pillow is of good quality and the craftsmanship seems equally good, this pillow is too small to do an adult much good.  It is much smaller than you might think and will not serve its intended purpose.  It could be perfect perhaps for a child 
 I have enjoyed almost all her other works but this one was a waste of money and time.  I couldn't force myself to get to the end.  Continually I turned the page in hopes it would get better but it didn't.  The way she moves the point of view from Katharine back to the story is not enjoyable.  I would hate not to enjoy Philippa Gregory again but this one will make me think twice before paying full price again 
 Calling "The Truelove', whose story is primarily that of Clarissa Oakes, a woman who has been sexually abused from early girlhood until she boards Aubrey's ship [and, one might argue, until she leaves] a light hearted romp is misleading.  Hardly the first time this series has dealt with the impact of a woman on 'the wooden world' that Aubrey, Maturin and the ever changing cast of supporting characters inhabit, this time it shows everyone behaving in odd and surprising ways. Jack is thick headed and oblivious. Stephen, normally so clear-eyed, sends Clarissa, who admits not only to disliking children but to throwing an infant down a well, to stay with his wife and their newborn. Pullings throws off his sense of duty and is befuddled as well as bewitched.  Since Clarissa [like all O'Brian's 'strong' females] is really a man in a skirt [for a woman in uniform we have the aptly named Killick, in all his shrewish glory] she is far too flat, vague and undeveloped to carry such large portions of the plot with any measure of success.  This is definitely the worst book of the series and, sadly, in some ways not a good book at all. Not just because the plot is so out of place in this series, or even because characters you have grown to know start behaving in ways that are inexplicable, but because they have almost disappeared from the story to be replaced by someone you can't actually care about because she seems so fake 
 Not very interesting and dated, like something out of Reader's Digest. I laughed a lot at the dated profundity but the list was not quite as funny as Letterman's top 10 
 Like many of you are thinking about, I bought this through a website (Apple). I bought it based on the name brand, partnerships, and design (I must admit, it is a very nice design - in theory) figuring, "Hey, Nike invented this additional sensor and must have figured out a way to fit into a nice little package...I'll spend $30."  IT DOESN'T FIT CORRECTLY & YOU CANNOT SEE THE SCREEN. This armband is NOT FUNCTIONAL! I even tried to make it work by fitting some tissue at the bottom to raise it to its "intended" position, but inevitably the tissue shifted during the run.  I used the Nike+ armband a total of three times over a 10-mile period and IT CAUSED PROBLEMS DURING EACH RUN.  First, I had trouble adjusting the volume. Second, I accidentally kept pausing my workout trying to play my "Power Song" (center button on Nano).  Third, on my longest run, just today, I accidentally erased the workout trying to end the workout without taking the Nano out of its case (I still don't know how I did this).  I was so frustrated after that third negative occurrence that I immediately went out and bought a different case. I'm not going to name drop, but just type in NIKE+ armband and there are several other options (okay, I will name drop).  My favorite, (especially because I did not want to purchase the Nike+ shoes) was the Marware Sportsuit Relay; this set comes with a neoprene Nike+ sensor pouch (to attach to your current running shoes) and a wrist/arm band that covers the entire Nano with room for the additional Nike+ transmitter. Bottom Line - Nike+ system and partnership with Apple Nano = AWESOME! Honestly works perfect and I couldn't be happier so far, but don't give Nike any more $ for this specific armband. Hopefully we will see enough bad reports, and Nike will come out with a new, more functional design. 
 This film, if you can actually call it that sghould have been a 10minute short. It is a 90 minute watered down stale acted piece of garbarge that never should have been released. But what can you expect from a distributor who also releases cineam classics like Da Hip Hop Witch. The director has alot to learn if she intends on trying to make it....if not she'll be leaving soon for her parents house where she will undoubtably seek refuge 
 Too boring to ever really loathe, McLachlan has long remained on that cusp of mediocrity and frustration - hints of beauty surface here and there every few years, but the compendium is always the same - dull songs, listless vocals, uninspiring and lazy musical arrangement. Nothing here as breathtaking as `Ben's Song' or `Possession' or `Do What You Have To Do', but we have a host of replicates of the dreaded `Angel' and `Into The Fire' and `Solace' and any other countless fungible melodies from her pretty-enough canon. She might or might not be a hack, but if she is, she's a fancy hack.  My grade:  C 
 I purchased this book after reading the reviews on Amazon.  All those 5 star reviews convinced me!  They were wrong.  I find more help in the owners manual I received with my new electric pressure cooker!  Too many speciality ingredients that I don't even know where to buy, much less whether we like or not. Too many ingredients in general.  I was looking for down home, easy, family-type meals, and found "gourmet" type recipes.  I now check out the customer reviews rather than the "experts" and I read the reviews more carefully and watch for key words like simple, few ingredients, family, ingredients I find on my shelves, etc.  I also check out table of contents when offered 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was not what I expected and I was bored 95% of the time 
 this is one of those movies that you have to ask,"why remake a movie that did it right the first time!!! buy the 1968 version and forget this one! skip it! 
 For many centuries in "civilized" Europe, the mostpopular form of mass entertainment was watching other people being putto death in horrible ways. This phenomenon reached its apex (or if you will, its nadir) during the Roman empire, with the infamous games of the amphitheater. As Roland Auguet relates, in his recent book, Cruelty and Civilization, the games had their origin in the funeral customs of wealthy Etruscan families, who would compel a few of their slaves to kill each other in ritual combat as a form of sacrifice to appease the spirit of the deceased. By the time of Caesar Augustus, these gladiatorial combats had pretty much lost any vestige of a religious character and become huge spectacles, organized with all the style of big budget Hollywood productions. Like the blockbuster movie, they often featured a cast of thousands. The big difference was that in the Roman shows, the blood was real, the stunts weren't faked, and the stars really died.  Everyone loved the games. The most respectable women in Rome, the Vestal Virgins, had their own reserved seating so they could have a close-up view of men being hacked to pieces, disembowelled, or torn apart by wild animals. Roman fathers would take their sons to see murder done for the same reasons they'd take them to a hockey game today; it was good clean fun. The Romans revelled in violence in a way that is hard for us to accept or understand.  In Cruelty and Civilization, Mr.  Auguet promises us something more than just a standard narrative history of the Roman games; he also proposes to offer some kind of psycho-moral analysis. Unfortunately, he is such a slavish admirer of Roman culture that he can't bring himself to see it clearly. Right at the beginning of the book, he asserts that "there is nothing more incompatible with the Roman mentality than the form of cruelty known as sadism." - in spite of all the evidence to the contrary. Having ruled out the most natural and logical explanation for the games - that the Romans, like all human beings, had their dark side - Auguet is then unable to come up with any alternative theory. He raises all the usual questions but doesn't provide any new answers. So why did he bother to write the book? And why should we bother to read it 
 I had been given a slow cooker a while ago, but could never find good recipes for it.  When I thumbed through this book, the pictures and ingredients looked wonderful, so I bought it.  What a mistake!  These recipes could be made much faster and with the same amount of effort if I didn't even use my slow cooker! If I have to cook everything before I put it in the slow cooker, what exactly is the point? I could cook it using my stove and oven in less time with the same results and effort (something I have successfully tried twice). While the recipes are fairly good in general, this was not at all what I was looking for and to me, it has defeated the purpose of using the slow cooker. 
 This book appears to be useful only for secondary teachers.  That was not stated in any of the information about the book and I would not have purchased it had I known.  The author should have thought of that in the title, since its not what every teacher needs to know, but only secondary teachers.  Its was not useful at all for people at the elementary level 
 I don't know whether Seinfeld creator Larry David had A Nos Amours in mind for the mock Eurotrash film that appears in repeated episodes, Rochelle, Rochelle. There are so many French films that could be described as "a young girl's strange erotic journey from Milan to Minsk" - the sexual activities/awakenings of pretty young teenagers is somewhat of a national obsession. It's hard to pick just one.  Maurice Pialat is widely known as "the French Cassavetes" (or, if you are British, "the French Ken Loach") which is the shorthand way of saying he's French, made films on the fringe of the European studio system, imbued his pictures with unsentimental realism, and is well-liked by film snobs who see Pialat's lack of relative mainstream success on these shores as proof of their sophisticated taste. His feature length debut, L'Enfance Nue, was tendered the Francois Truffaut mark of approval (it was produced by the master) as well as a Prix Jean Figo. That award is given each year to a promising French director, generally a young one though Pialat was a forty-four when he got his. He cemented his reputation as un auteur with 1987's Sous le soleil de Satan, which not only won him the Palme d'Or but iconoclast status for life when he flipped off some booing audience members while accepting it. Sounds like a guy I could like.  If only A Nos Amours were a better film.  The picture stars sixteen-year-old Sandrine Bonnaire as the frequently-nude (not as titillating as it sounds) Suzanne, a confused French teenager wandering from one hollow sexual encounter to the next. She says she's only happy when she's in the arms of one of her paramours and we don't blame her: Suzanne's home-life is at best unusual, at worst fairly grotesque. Dad (played by Pialat himself) flies the coop early on, leaving his son, pudgy tyrant Robert (Dominique Besnehard) in charge of both daughter and half-crazy Mom (Evelyne Ker). Emotional and physical abuse relents only for short passages of awkward conversation, often hinging on some sort of inappropriately sexual subject that tinges everything in something akin to unconsummated incest. Mom calls daughter a slut who trades sex advice with Dad while fielding interminable compliments about her body from her brother who himself has become a surrogate husband to Mom. Everyone in this family (Suzanne included) seeks to make life miserable for everyone else, and in their own creepy ways they succeed.  Plenty of women seek the affections of too many men (or too many of the wrong men) to compensate for an absent father - such are the incontrovertible facts that cliché is made of. It's the sort of unsophisticated platitude-masquerading-as-wisdom we've come to expect from daytime talk shows, peddled to prostitutes and cheating spouses. In his own quasi-verité manner, I imagine Pialat was seeking to subvert the cliché, deconstruct it, transcend it - rarely does it actually come off. The meandering quarrels, beatings, and post-coital chit-chats all have the feel of work-shopping actors being put through an exercise rather than real life, even the life of a sexually-obsessed French person. Pialat never truly gets under the surface of these characters, frquently mistaking the bizarre and cruel for honest characterization (it's no surprise Catherine Breillat is such a fan of a the picture). One hundred minutes pass, and yet we still feel as though we do not know these characters - they remain only our acquaintances, obnoxious ones at that, and if it's all the same we rather wish we hadn't been introduced.  Interesting footnote: One of Suzanne's first sexual conquests is an American tourist - we meet him as his has an argument with some French sailors, whom he calls warmongers. This is probably the only time in cinema you will see an American character call a French one a warmonger 
 I was mislead into wasting money on Jim Fay's audio book on toddlers and I think Amazon and other  booksellers have a responsibility to be honest with consumers about this series;   The author as a promoted as a "doctor" and yet the series is  about heavy handed fundamentalist Christian parenting.  I used to live in Denver, and because the authors made several references to Colorado I began to wonder  if this were something put out by the "Focus on the Family" extremist cult based in Colorado Springs;  I was right. The titles and descriptions are deliberately misleading, but if you click on the copyright link you'll see that this is where it came from.  When did these extreme Christian fundamentalist pass an amendment to the "Shall not lie" commandment? When did it become a "Christian Value" to disguise, mislead and lie about an agenda in order to sell something that they know the buyer would have avoided had we been given honest information beforehand?  For me, this validates the fear that a lot of people in Colorado had expressed about this group. It also shows how  much the extreme Christian right has in common with the Muslim extremist in Afghanistan:  Both groups are willing to disregard the core dictates of the  religion they claim to follow if it serves their efforts to make money or to impose their  beliefs on the rest of the word.  I purchased the "Toddler Love and Logic" audio book from this series, and after the first 10 minutes of listening  to the these two men laughing at (and sarcastically imitating  the voices of) mother's they've overheard making " mistakes" in conversations with their children, I realized the real mistake had been in wasting my money.  Why would they use "Logic" in the title of a book that tells parents that they shouldn't take the time to explain the reasoning behind the 'commands' they make to their children? And what is logical about using a child's bedroom as a punishment during the day and expecting them to  view it as a comfortable safe place at bedtime? 
 Although this book may be so brilliantly written by John Reed, I found it to be too laden with historical details, and even somewhat confusing for someone who is using this book to merely familiarize her (him)self with the makings of the Russian Revolution for the first time.  The book provides with a glossary of Russian terms, events and political parties necessary to understand it but even so I found myself hopelessly stumbling through the chapters trying to pick up information here and there.  However, due to my lack of knowledge of Russian history I was unable to piece together any of the information.  So, in frustration I gave up and relinquished the book to somebody who knows somebody who is a "history buff".  From this experience I learned that if you want to familiarize yourself with a historical event about which you know truly nothing, it is always better to read a book which describes that event perhaps in a very broad outline form on the first page of the book.  The rest of the book should be written according to that outline. A glossary of main events would also be helpful.  On the other hand I do realize that most historical events are way too complicated to be approached in this manner.  Anyway, if you would like to expand your knowledge about the Russian Revolution, I highly recommend this book.  However, if like me you are looking to merely acquire a basic knowledge about this historical event you will get lost in its too many facts 
 Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clichï¿½ upon clichï¿½ is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.  All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.   Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. 
 This book is actually worse than Lahaye's deeply disturbing and nonsensical "Rapture" series because it masquerades under the guise of "scholarship."  Of course the book it claims to be analyzing can only be proven true by refrencing passages in that book that claim that its true.  So, borrowing a tactic from our all knowing Heavenly Furher Jesus:  THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT IS TRUE: Christians are full of **** and shouldn't be allowed to publish books.  You read it so it must be true 
 It should be noted in the description of this item that this product also doubles as a vibrator! I'm not talking about the muscle relaxing kind; I'm talking about the sexually stimulating kind. Once you remove the plastic prongs that are designed to relax the head/neck, the base is an approximately 5 inch vibrator.  Just be forewarned, customers, this item is not for the easily offended 
 At his best, MacLean is near the top of the pulp action genre with interesting locations and characters and a bit of romance.  "Fear", a story of revenge, misses the mark.  I never could quite connect with the protaganist and surprisingly, the ending was neither compelling or, to me, satisfying.  Other MacLean books such as "Dusty Death" and "Caravan" better display his true abilities 
 I take AP psychology and I cant believe are school bought this book. I have many psychology books and I really think the scenarios help one have a better understanding of psychology, especially if someone is not use to the language of psychology. This book revolves around three people, Marc, Todd and Dan and they just do really lame and boring things together and somehow Dr. Rathus makes correlations b/w them and psychology. Not only that, the author is just plane lazy, constantly referring to other books and authors all through the text presumably because he doesn't have any ingenuity at all. The worst of all of this book is that some of the information is just wrong, giving the reason why I had to give it one star. $82.00 is what "Dr. Rathus" and Holt should be paying me to just read this grotesque textbook 
 Billy Joel's career was built around an image of himself as the "young rebel" fighting against traditional American prejudices and bringing in the ideas of the "young".   Well, now that Billy Joel himself is older than most of the people in the "older" generation, even if he were to come back to rock and roll he would look rather ridiculous. I doubt if the effect could ever be the same.  Well, perhaps it might be! Mick Jagger is still singing about partying in the streets of New York (changing values) and he is old enough to be the grandfather of the kids who are partying in the streets of New York. Jagger is even older than the President.  Perhaps the old people of today really can jump up and rebel against the older generation. . . but which older generation? The one that's now dead?  As to Billy Joel. Billy Joel was one of the greatest in his day. His music had power and influence that rocked the world. Like the paintings of Leonardo Da Vinci, his artistry will be ageless. His music will be listended to even five centuries from now.  But although the music is ageless, the man who made the music unfortunately is not. It is my opinion that when one becomes a certain age, it's time for him to admit he is no longer a member of the younger generation rebeling against the old. He IS the older generation now. Sadly, it's time for Billy Joel to pass the torch to someone else. 
 Graduating high school in 1990, I really can appreciate the whole hair metal thing. But unless your a hardcore "Slaughter" fan, they really were a two hit wonder. Not that they're so bad, it's just that they make "Warrant" and "Cinderella" seem amazing in comparison. Your best bet is to find their hit songs on a "Hair" collection, and hope that they're between a "Motley Crue" and "Skid Row" song. That should keep you up all night 
 There are a variety of approaches to starting a Research Business, and this book simply does little justice to providing business-smart content for doing just that. If you want to embark into a research business on your own, this might give you a vision but it will certainly not give you the business smarts you need to really start and manage your new business. Best to look into resources on starting a consulting business and other resources about starting any business.  Best of luck.  - Dissapointe 
 Shakespeare's play already contains plenty of time-shifts.  Ancient Athens meets fairlyland,  which in turn meets Elizabethan tradespeople-turned-thespians...adding layers of 19th century Italy to the mix,  and bicycles,  and windeup gramophones, and a repetitive recycling of Italian opera's greatest hits on the soundtrack,  just muddies things up.  Lots of money went into this production,  and it does have some nice visuals.  But there is no genuine artistic vision here.  Less would have been more.  The two stars are for the director's concept,  not for author William S., whose best lines are just about impossible to ruin 
 I purchsed this kettle about half a year ago and it's already broken. The switch kept turning off automatically before boiling. On top of that the outside is not insulated and i got burned by it 
 The title is far better than the actual book.  All it does it make you even more obsessed with food, and now even sugars in fruits are bad!  I don't like the strictly outlined nutritional program--I don't think that works for people who "can't stop eating".  I know that strictly outlined nutritional programs don't work for me.  I know from personal experience that most of the time when people can't stop eating, someone giving you a new list of things you can't eat isn't going to help much.  All this book did was make me feel more helpless in the face of my binge-eating disorder 
 This "documentary" has the look and feel of THIS IS SPINAL TAP: the situations are absurd and the characters are ridiculous but there's a harsh feeling of reality to the proceedings.  The comedy here is the nonstop beating of these preening, arrogant "air personalities" who try to hold their lofty perches up while getting hit with horrendous business practices, battering reality checks ("John Kerry can still win this!"), and abyssmal ratings--all while sniping at who's getting better PR and bickering with their audience or co-workers or even their own family members. I don't even know if the blokes from Spinal Tap would've soldiered on this long!  But leave it to HBO to put a "happy ending" on this othewise fascinating documentary.  That even made me laugh outloud: after seeing the complete chaos of how Air America came into being, HBO shows a graphic of the USA and insinuates that the radio network is springing up all over the map and firmly taking root.  I just read today that Air America's shares have fallen dramatically (Randi Rhodes is 25th in New York City) and I know they've been replaced by a Mexican mariachi station where I am in the West. Was HBO's final graphic to this "documentary" meant to be part of the joke 
 This book was published in the year 1962. I wonder if it needs to be updated to be accurate and to take into account discoveries since 1962 
 This book provides a very simplistic view of the sociological ramifications of the Rolling Stones.   One or two of the other online reviewers correctly state that this book provides a very limited view of the Stones, in that Watts and Wood seem to be mostly "yes men," and no one who would contest Mick and Keith are given a voice.  Where are Bill Wyman, Mick Taylor, Marianne Faithfull, Anita Pallenberg et al.?   Way too much space is devoted to the period after 1972.  I couldn't care less about their disco period, the 80s, etc.  Half of the book involves Ron Wood who is, at best, a mediocre guitar player.  One chapter is entitled "The New Kid" (referring to Wood).  Barf.  The majority of the book should have focused on '62-'72.  I suppose the Stones feel obligated to talk about such garbage as "Dirty Work", but it's only to make those later pieces seem more important than they were.  Ron Wood wrote many of the songs on "Dirty Work".  What does that tell you about his ability?   The multitude of photographs point to the fact the rock and roll is mostly a visual phenomenon these days (probably caused by the Stones!).  Substance is not as important as attitude, looks, and for lack of a better word "coolness".  It's sad to see less intellectual content and more filler from the people who gave us "Gimme Shelter", "Satisfaction", "Dead Flowers", etc. After just seeing the documentary "Gimme Shelter," it becomes painfully obvious that the Stones were probably washed up as early as 1970.  Ironically, it may have been Mick Taylor (who is trashed by everyone interviewed) who kept them going musically for the next few years.  I'm not sure if it's true but I read that many of the tracks for "Exile on Main Street" were written during the sessions for "Let It Bleed".  Interesting.   Is it possible that Keith's drug problems completely ruined the band and that they couldn't come up with new, good material after he became addicted to heroin in `69?  None of this is explored.  In fact, no topic is approached with the level headedness you would hope for from men in their 60s.   Consideration is given to whether Wood or Jagger wrote "It's Only Rock and Roll."  It's like arguing over who deserves credit for picking Eagleton as McGovern's running mate.        Even with his loyalty to the bosses, Watts provides reasonably interesting material.  Mick Jagger's sections are a total waste, just pathetic in terms of providing insight.  I'm convinced after reading this book and seeing "Gimme Shelter" that Mick Jagger has the mind of a child.  Keith basically goofs around.  This shouldn't come as a shock if you have seen any footage from the `60s where Richards' PR consisted of him sticking his tongue out at a camera.   "Stone Alone" by Wyman is a quantum leap above this book, although in fairness to "According to the Rolling Stones", this is really a children's book and shouldn't be compared to Wyman's serious effort.  
 Not only does the new music change the mood and quality of critical scenes, it's tantamount to watching old Batman episodes. As soon as something develops, in comes the cheesy music... The added scenes were poorly produced which is why they didn't make the original cut...The interviews seemed contrived.  I'm not impressed.  The older version supersedes the new 
 Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole "We're married and my husband's a doctor." charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and "Dr. Holmes" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?  What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.  Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?  Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us "don't do it!" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!  It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap 
 All in all not a horrible album, but their Pink Floyd The Wall ending to the CD seemed about as appropriate as a fart in church 
 I expected this book to be about PARENTING an only child per its title and was disappointed. Susan Newman did touch on some important issues such as teaching sharing and respectfulness and avoiding loneliness, although there wasn't a lot of meat to the chapters on these subjects. She also discussed being careful not to have excessive expectations of an only child, which I found interesting. However, a great deal of this book was devoted to justifying the decision to have an only child. If you're struggling with your family planning choices and would like someone to tell you repeatedly you're doing the right thing, you may enjoy this book. At this point, I don't need justification, I need information on addressing relevant issues so that I can be the best possible parent to my child. I also do not need reasons why my decision to have an only child is "superior" to the paths other families choose and was a little disturbed by the author's tone. Bottom line: this book effectively identifies some concerns of parents of only children, but I will be looking elsewhere for more substantial parenting support 
 Not very well known, but one of the most important artists in his styl 
 ...mayhap I have picked the wrong Coulter novel with which to begin. Even still, I cannot say it has been totally without mirth. I have found some of the dialogue laugh-out-loud funny (audio book version.) Talking back in response to the ludicrous dialogue affords some diversion, though mayhap most for drivers around me.  Must everything be redder than red, blacker than black, whiter than white, higher than high, etc? Did I really hear that the earth moved during a vigorous amatory adventure? In subject matter, this dialogue is clearly intended for adult audiences. In construction, it rivals "See Spot run". By all the saints' pimply noses, mayhap the most fun is to be derived from the creative and deliberately non-repetitive invocations of said saints. I could wish though that someone close to the author would favor us by building an auto-correct into her word processor to over-ride "mayhap" and "hard".  Oh, aye, I'll finish it (it really is a long, boring drive home and it is futile to wish the time back) but I'm glad this was a library freebie. By all the saints' split ends, I'd have been madder than mad had I purchased it 
 the nikon camera s3 is a good camera but the camera takes to long to take a picture i dont like it because when i am at a party i want to take a fast picture. it sucks and i wish i never bought it dont make the same error i did and waist my money on the piece of junk. 
 My nephew really needed a new controller.  So I ordered this along with a game for his birthday.  The game was received fine, but he never received the controller.  I finally got notification of shipping delay several weeks later.  Yet the controller still listed as ships within 24 hours on Amazon.  The delays kept coming and eventually it just turned into a cancelled order by Amazon.    So the 1 star is for the service, the delay, and the lack of full explanation.  Who knows, the controller could have been wonderful?? 
 I just tried to read this book but I had to put it down. Unfortunately, the author, Joshua M. Greene is not a particularly good writer. The stilted prose reads like it was written for 11-year-olds.  I wanted to learn more about George Harrison and his spirituality - honestly, I did. George Harrison was a huge influence on me when I was young, and he helped steer me onto a spirtual path.  But I started reading this book and it opened with the same Beatles biographical information that I've already read 100 times. Paul met John and George met Paul and John thought George was a pain and he was young and he had big ears and John's mother was killed and he was raised by his Aunt Mimi and the music from America came to Liverpool before the rest of England...WHO NEEDS TO READ THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN???  Not me. I don't have the time. I returned the book to the library 
 Let me see if I have got this right? The only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way? That way we all gain? OK the bosses of Nike, McDonalds, and Wal-Mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk, but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide?  Sounds good: who would want to be the party pooper?!  Well someone's got to be, and for the simple reason that we don't live on a planet the size of Jupiter.   The oil's finite: we know that but can't be bothered to act on it. Even the supply of water is turning out to be finite: the south east of England is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water. OK, they could ship it in from the rest of the UK where there's no problem, but for reasons that don't quite add up that's not possible. It's not the corporate solution, if you will forgive the pun.  Has it occurred to anyone, I wonder, if it's capitalist-driven growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems? Yes, I know Marx and Stalin don't offer any fixes, but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced: growth is going to wind-down whether we like it or not.  
 I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it.  After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw.  After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book.  It found it's way to the trash can.  Don't waste your time on this 
 anyone who thinks this is a good transfer must be daft.  in addition as was mentioned earlier 11 minutes have been cut and as i remember the film they were some of the "best" scenes if you get my drift.  if you want to see the original film this is not it.  avoid at all costs 
 I tried to read this book(translated) to the portuguese, about 15 years ago.Even never finishing it, I as a brazilian (unemployed) agronomist must tell the reality about weberianism. At first, Max Weber was a man looking to show the reality.He wasn't a bigot(or mad) such as Loraine Boettner, Eric Jon Phelps, etc. With no doubt, Max Weber was a great scholar, a man with great IQ, a man man looking for reality.Even with this qualities, Max weber was wrong.Even a man like Max Weber, like you and me, is ever a prisioner of his times, informations and reality. The core idea of this book is that capitalism, industrial revolution and modern science were made by protestantism. Very believed idea in Weber's times. In fact, Weber puts "the cart ahead of the horse", in this idea.In fact, modern world wasn't created after Luther.It was shaped in XV Century, with the press and Great Navigations. The press was invented by a catholic german, called Johann Gutemberg.All the great navigators were catholic men.Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Bartolomeu Dias,Cabral, Gil Eanes,etc. 100% of then were catholics and were under catholic kings money and orders.With the Great discoveries the American continent was under Europe's hands.The claim that protestantism was the source of Europe's power was and is a fraud. In fact economically and lively, after Luther, protestant Germany became a nightmare until the end of 30 years War, in 1648.The claim that protestantism was good for Europe is a possibility, not a fact. In fact, we could see protestantism is a result of nacionalism, church's abuses, education and greed for church's money. Not all protestants countries of Europe had good economical results.Germany was doomed after Luther's Reformations.Not all catholic countries had bad economic results, as France shows.Spain and Portugal were bad, after jew's expeling, not after any reformation. With the Industrial Revolution, coal became condition "sine qua non" for economical sucess.And the Geology(not theology)decided the future for nations in Europe.With no coal Portugal, Spain, Italy were senteced to relatively poverty, in Europe.France with bad coal reserves, has some dificults in industrialization.Belgium, even more than 90% of his population in catholic church, had no economical problems, because Belgium had great coal's mines. Why England had so good economic results, ahead of every other european country?Beeing an island, England shouldn't have an expensive army against invasions.Then, England could built the biggest navy in the world.Geography, not theology gave economic sucess to England in XVI and XVII Century.With the Industrial Revolution, England had coal reserves looking to be minerated. Geography and later geology gave England industrial and economical sucess.With the 30 years War, Germany was splited in about 300 feufdoms. The England's decadency also came from no theological problemas, but geological, political and tecnological problems.With the reunification of Germany, an industrial enemy was created in continental Europe.With the invention of airplane, England could be attacked by an enemy with no navy.With the coming of oil's age, England (North Sea oil's reserves not found before the 1960's) had to import100% of his fuel.With both World wars, England's empire was sentenced to death. Protestantism in fact, like today, was ever divided in thounsands of cults, since his beginnings.If fact all kinds of protestantisms are image and similarity of his human creator, culture and society.Luther made a anti-semithic protestantism suc as himself.Calvin made a bank's friend protestantism, as himself was.And the England's king Henry VIII made an english protestantism.All reformator made a Jesus equal to himself.This fact is true until today.Protestantism don't make a society and culture.In fact a society and a culture makes a protestantism. The brazilian and latin american reality shows that protestantism itself don't make economical sucess.Here in Brazil, 80% of people who go to a church, go to a protestant (pentecostal) church.Do we have economical sucess with all this protestantism? NO!!!! This same fact happened in many parts of latin America.Bad economic results followed protestantism growing.El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua all are as protestants(pentecostals) as Brazil.All with bad economical results. About 35% of brazilian population are protestants, against about 80% of brazilian maids are protestants.In fact the brazilian protestants are, poorer than the general brazilian population.Also brazilian states with more protestants have bigger crime rates.In fact, more protestants, more crimes in Brazil.The poorest of all religious groups in Brazil are, the protestants(pentecostal).Only protestantism as a medicine for economical, political and cultural troubles is a quackery. Not a single african or latin american country had good economical results after protestantism's growing.At the same time, Spain with less than 1% of his population protestant, is an economical sucess.Italy and Portugal with only about 2% of protestants are also developed countries.  This book is a source with some good things to read.As I wrote up, Max Weber was an honest scholar, not a mad or a bigot.After all, Max Weber was looking to show us the reality, but he only wrote us rooted, in his own times, believes and realities.Every man is a prisioner of his times, friends and realities.And Max Weber wasn't an exception.          
 We all know Repbulicans don't care much for the environment, and now we're chopping down trees to give more praise to a man whose son's ambition is paid for with American lives. Why was this book written? Are trhe Bush-Kochs suddenly strapped for cash?    The book, if you can focus on a father and daughter that aren't dripping with wealth and power, is good enough. I like GHWB, voted for him, but the lovefest is going way overboard.   And as for the $500 billion dollar aircraft carrier (the tenth and final Nimitz-class supercarrier) just commisioned and named after George, Sr---it was absolutely wrong to do so. The man CVN-77 should have been named after is Admiral James B. Stockdale. Admiral Stockdale, a distinguished naval aviator and test pilot flight instructor, flew over 240 carrier-based missions, earned 28 combat decorations, and after being shot down over North Vietnam in 1965, spent 8 years as a P.O.W., 4 years in leg irons, 2 years in complete darkness, tortured and beaten daily. It is amazing that he didn't go blind after 2 years in darkness, malnourished and sleeping on concrete. Despite all of his pain, his primary concern was always the welfare of his fellow prisoners and that they received enough food and proper medical care. Stockdale even organized a hunger strike when one prisoner was denied medical treatment. At one point, he knew that one of his fellow P.O.W.s was guilty of an infraction that would possibly lead to that prisoner's execution. His captors knew Stockdale knew who the guilty prisoner was, and tortured Stockdale without mercy. Knowing there would be more torture and fearful he would crack and give out the prisoner's name, Stockdale attempted suicide. Rather than bear the thought of one of his fellow prisoners being executed or subjected to the pain that was inflicted on him, he tried to take his own life. Stockdale's suicide attempt was unsuccessful, yet in the attempt, was the ultimate statement about Admiral James B. Stockdale, that he would rather have died than see a fellow American soldier suffer pain or death at the hands of their captors. That maybe true about GHWB, but perhaps not so about our current President. Adwarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1976, Admiral Stockdale died in July of 2005. Even GHWB would tell you that CVN-77 should have been named after Admiral Stockdale.   Why isn't that in your book, Doro? On October 7th, 3 days after your book was released, you christened the USS George H.W. Bush, CVN-77. It rained that day. So much so that the ceremony was closed to the public 
 Just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced.  This is a $5.00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit.  It will protect against scratching, but only the areas of the unit you're not really concerned about.  The screen is totally exposed, so it can be scratched when in the unit.  I'm sure that's so you can see the screen better, but a clear protective cover (that can open and close) over the screen would have been nice.  Anyway, at $25.00 this is too much to spend.  I'm ordering a leather cover with a kick stand (which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table) for less than the price of this product.  I feel I just flushed $25.00 bucks down the drain, hopefully you will not.  
 This brief novel offers a rather pointless speculative fiction take on Conrad's Heart of Darkness. A ridiculous and under-explained premise is used to prop up some equally under-explained ruminations from Ballard on the human condition and spirituality. Here the action takes place in an African jungle that is becoming crystallized, as all objects slowly become encrusted with luminous jewels. Ballard doesn't explain how this process works except for some weak references to the "crystallized" time and space aspects of relativity. This implausible premise leads to curious changes in the people who also find themselves crystallized, with some sort of inner peace and spiritual fulfillment being found in the process, though Ballard leaves this aspect of the story anemic as well, other than some flimsy philosophical ramblings. Meanwhile, the action of the story mostly involves a pointless chase sequence connected to a blood feud between two shallow supporting characters, which is never resolved within the story. Add to all of this the book's outdated colonialist conceptions of the third world and its inhabitants, and the weak premise and theme of this novel retreat further into the crystal haze.

 David Fromkin's "Peace to End All Peace" is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work. Many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other.  Fromkin attempts to examine how the modern Middle East (extending as far as Afghanistan and some sections of Central Asia) was created during and after the First World War. Obviously, in order to do this, the fall of the Ottoman Empire in that war must be considered. This is where Fromkin's unusual methodology comes into play. Focusing on the European political machinations to resolve the "Eastern Question" in their favour, the sorry tale becomes one more of Churchill and TE Lawrence than of the Arabs and Turks who were also involved in the process. Admittedly, it was the Europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn, but reducing key figures such as the CUP Triumvirate in the dying Ottoman Empire (and Kemal Ataturk in Turkey immediately thereafter) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much.  Never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell. A complex web of national and personal political interests in both Europe and the Middle East combined to make the region what it is today, and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations. The problem that Fromkin has, however, is that he does not make these very well at all. The story is told in a roughly chronological manner, which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters. Ultimately, the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader, who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is.  Additionally, Fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided. Indeed, one map (showing Enver Pasha's advance on Baku and his campaigns in Central Asia) is laughable in the extreme. The legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows, and not equilateral triagles.  Where Fromkin does well, however, is in his use of purely European sources. It is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern Middle East, but I have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the Middle Eastern aspects of the events in question. In terms of Europe, however, his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did.  Ultimately, "A Peace to End All Peace" is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work. A diplomatic history of Europe during the Great War can be written much better than this, and a history of the development of the Middle East following that conflict already has been (the chapters in Margaret Attwood's "The Peacemakers" or William Cleveland's "Modern Middle East" both easily outshine this) 
 I am 15 years old and was required to read this book as summer reading for my school. Let me just say that this is the most punishingly boring book I have ever opened. I say opened because I just could not finish it. I was doing fine until I reached his section about the future of computers. I had to skip the entire section...about 50 pages or so. It, along with almost every other section of the book is impossible to understand, at least for a 15 year old. After that, the book just kept going downhill, and I gave up. This book is not interesting in the least. Avoid at all costs 
 This book is for readers with little or no knowledge of recent debates on energy security, global warming, etc. as well as related technological advances in fields such as hydrogen and fuel cells. The author contributes little to previous books on the subject, such as Rikin's book on hydrogen which is much better researched and just as accesible to the general public. If anything, the book's original contribution is to discuss how energy and environmental issues can be addressed using market mechanisms. In doing so, the author comes up with some interesting case studies, but it's quite obvious he is biased toward the same tired free-market ideology that is endlessly promoted in the pages of The Economist, which happens to be the author's employer. Moreover, there was little effort in integrating the various chapters. Overall, a very disapointing book. The author should stick to journalism 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 After a promising start the entire story moved along with such linear precision that it may have been written by a mathematician. Never did it deviate from a plotline that was anticipated after the second chapter. In the genre of heist stories we've come to expect twists and turns until the last minute. Here we had none. I was waiting for somebody to be something other than what they appeared to be, somebody to do something out of character. And the thorough implausibility of the climactic confrontation on stage in front of 5000 people had me shaking my head. Oh, and if somebody would be kind enough to post a follow up review explaining the significance of the hitch hiker, I'd appreciate it 
 Firstly, this product is useless as is - the dock will not stay above water.  You must silicone it to your tank for it to remain stable.  That being said, it is inappropriate for this usage as well.  It is made of styrofoam which a turtle with claws will rip apart (and will eat the pieces.)  My adult RES broke off the entire corner of the dock and there was a LARGE METAL SPIKE PROTRUDING pointing in the exact direction the turle climbs from.  I suppose this is the inner armature - it is not a blunt-edge metal wire, which would be dangerous enough, but a thick VERY SHARP spike.  I actually broke skin by touching it while trying to photograph it (sending a letter to the company.)   I consider myself very lucky that my turtle did not impale himself.  Stay away from this product.  If you would like a ramp, I suggest getting a piece of cork bark and siliconing it to your tank 
 The product has made my skin MUCH worse than when I started. I am so sorry I  even kept at it!!   :(  How can I reverse all the damage now that Murad has given me. :* 
 The second CD was scratched and hence I cannot play it. I would appreciate it if you would send me another one and also include the information needed to return the damaged one sent to me.  Thanks.  Jeann 
 This nonsensical bio is written entirely from a blind feminist perspective.  The research is suspect.  The prose amateurish.  The details gossipy and contrived. If Eleanor Roosevelt was truly a woman of thought and progressivism, then Cook has done her an unforgivable disservice. If you're looking to understand Roosevelt's honest-to-goodness place in history, you will not find it is this intellectually offensive work 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this clown, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 Like some of the other reviewers, this was pretty much the first book I ever read on the subject, but later as I studied more, I discovered that Wilson has so filled this book with bias and irrelevancy as to make it virtually useless.  It's only saving grace is that so many players in the game are namechecked that the interested student will at least know where to look.  There is also the final chapter, "Glimpses", which might have made a good small book on its own, with its discussion of "Faculty X", that I rather liked.  On the whole though, I can't say that the brand new edition is worth it--you'd be better off purchasing this one from an Amazon Seller 
 I was very appointed when I finished this book. The book is not meant for advanced brewers and did not explain any chemical reactions of the brewing process at all. The author even makes a few errors while explaining the  proces of brewing. The chapter of offflavours is slightly interesting. My  opinion: if you want to buy a goof book on advanced brewing techniques buy  the book An Analysis of Brwing Techniques from Fi 
 Dean makes very specific accusations in the very subtitle of this book, yet he provides no documentation to back his assertions. I expect more from a scholar 
 As a teacher, I read a lot of books about education and childhood development.  Real Boys is typical of most of these books in that the author takes 500-600 pages to say what he could have expressed in 100 pages.  Read the first chapter and you get the point of the whole book. 
 Like David Wheaton, I too am a student at Stanford University, which for him seemed to be the equivalent of Babylon. Personally, I love my first year here and I'm looking forward to getting my Master's in Graphic Design. I realize that this book was written by a Christian for Christians, but just hear me out.  Mr. Wheaton seems to believe that the problem is colleges are oppresive and discriminatory towards Christians. Rather, I think the problem really is that Christians such as Mr. Wheaton have a hard time dealing with the diveristy and variety of people, faiths, philosophies, sexual orientations and ideas on college campuses. They seem to think that everyone will think and believe as they do the second they arrive for campus orientation. If this were the case, they would at a Christian college.  At college, no one will force you to abandone your faith. No one will force beer down your throat or force pot smoke down your lungs unless you give them license to. No one will tell you what to think. In fact, no one forces you to go to these colleges in the first place 
 This step stool is not worth it - the steps that are shown extended in the photo connect only via a plastic groove in the red plastic cross bars shown on the legs of the stepstool.  Therefore, when you move the stool, the steps flop along.  You have to move them out yourself and put them back in yourself.  They come off too easily so you are having to place them inside the groove whenever you move the stool/chair.  The stool itself is very small and while this is OK for a stationary perching stool, it is NOT good for a step stool and too small and uncomfortable as a seat 
 I was excited to see a book on documentation and made the mistake of ordering it without seeing a few reviews from other readers.  68 pages is barely enough for a couple of chapters, certainly not enough for a $20 book.  Save your money and wait for a better book to come out, or read "Business Process Improvement Workbook" from Harrington, Esseling and Nimwegen which I would give 5 stars.  This is the most disappointing business book I have ever purchased 
 Very disappointed in his research.  All of his studies were conducted by a government research group of somekind.   Mr. Piscatella states on page 51 that he recommends Canola Oil.  Really?  Is he not aware that Canola was developed from the rape seed and is thus unsuited for human consumption.  Why?  because it contains a long-chain fatty acid called erucic acid, which under some circumstances is associated with fibrotic heart lesions coupled with a very high sulphur content and goes rancid easily (Nourishing Traditions, 2001).  Not to mention Mr. Piscatella condemns tropical oils which are high in lauric acid which are not only stable at high temperatures but has high antifungal and antimicrobial properties.  Guess where lauric acid also can be found?  Mother's milk and we certainly don't condemn that.........yet!  On cholesterol, he's just wrong.  Or should I say the FDA is wrong.  On page 21 Mr. Piscatella emphasizes the importance of LDL and HDL ratios.  This is a typical FDA propaganda tool.  In the book, The Cholesterol Myths by Uffe Ravnshov, MD,PhD, Mr. Ravnshov states, "LDL-cholesterol is neither centrally nor causally important, it has not the strongest and most consistent relationship to risk of CHD, it has not a direct relationship to the rate of CHD, and it has not been studied in more than a dozen randomized trials..."  Mr. Piscatella is mistaken regarding soy.  He never distinguishes the difference between fermented soy products (tofu, miso) and unfermented soy products (soy milk).  Asians rarely consume unfermented soy products, if at all.  One thing Mr. Piscatella is correct on is the importance of triglyceride levels and margarine and shortening products.  Those products should be banned.    In my opinion, I would take this book and do almost the opposite it says and recommend the book, Nourishing Traditions, Sally Fallon/Mary Enig, Ph.D.   
 this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho 
 again, mcqueen did an 1 dimensional cardboard-like performance in this boring movie. all the other male or female actors performed well enough to keep the viewing marginally watchable. casting mcqueen as 'the kid' was a very bad choice, he's not young enough to be called 'kid', and i think the main reason he was chosen to play this role was because he got a dead-beat, expressionless poker face with a pair of dead fish eyes. he was never highly praised by movie critics and lot of them already said that he was a bad actor. i absolutely agree 
 ........from reading Danielle Steel.  Here's the book:  three bachelors meet three women.  They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.  BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.  I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.  Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.  My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.  THAT'S sad 
 With all due respect to Dr. Ablow, I thought he was really over-reaching in his analysis of someone he never met.  The book was filled with repetitive analytic conjecture about almost every sentence Scott ever spoke. Sometimes a duck is just a duck.  Dr. Ablow repeatedly states how Scott "probably said ....", or "probably thought..." and Lacy "probably replied..." The book is filled with these fictional guesses as to the thoughts and feelings that MAY have occurred.  Scott's apparent sociopathic behavior was traced in part to the murder of his maternal grandfather more than 50 years before Scott was born.  It's obvious that, to a great extent, our personalities are the result of our parental upbringing, but to relate dates of negative events in the life of Jacqueline Peterson to dates of negative events in Scott's life is patently ridiculous. Overall, I felt that this was just one more opportunity to take advantage of this sensational case to sell a book.  Very disappointing.  
 I bought the original LP double album a very long time ago, and was thinking of upgrading to a CD. Then I see the track list...ECM decided to lop off the tunes from Side 3, Gary Burton's solo "I'm Your Pal / Hullo, Bolinas" and Chick Corea's solo of "Love Castle".  The one star rating is for ECM, for not making this a two CD set.  The music that's there is great. 
 I love a good, fun, guilty pleasure type read as good as the next woman but this book had no point.  It was just silly.  It is fun to read books with these funny and extravagant characters when something actually happens.  This was more of a childish running commentary.  I got to the end and just wondered why even waste time writing something like this?  
 Let me say right off the bat, I am a skeptic, but still I loved author Gary Goldschneider's first two books from this series: the Secret Language of Birthdays and the SL of Relationships.  But this one, THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY is a bore.  Rather than offering two pages to each birth date, as Birthdays did, or a half of a page as Relationship did, this book gives the reader a short 1/4 page paragraph that allegedly sums up the destiny of those born in each of the 48 personology periods. This information is so general and by the way so boring that it could relate to anyone if in fact you don't fall asleep reading it.  For this reason, I do not recommend THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY.   -- Regina McMenami 
 Mr Bennet says nothing every other right wing looney has been sceeching for a decade! The Gays will destroy us! Divorce will ruin us! The Liberals are taking this country to H-E-DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS!! The Founding Fathers Mr Bennet is so fond of were Radicals, aka Liberals, not Reactionaries, aka Conservatives. Jefferson, Washington, Madison and Paine were the people who started this country,they believed in the rights of the accused, seperation of powers, division of church and state. The conservatives went back to England!! Please Mr Bennet, go back to England: The England of 1777, where your prejudices and narrow mindedness can find a happier home than here in this awful, liberal, radical, wonderful country!!! 
 Kottke is always an amazing guitarist to listen to. This video is laid back and comfortable to watch and is a guitar lovers musical feast. Enjoy it 
 So I thought that investing in the most recent edition of this book would behoove me, but upon looking up one of the "author's picks," for lodging, I discover that he and Lonely Planet have not updated the book for the hotel's *price.*  This is really important to me, as I work in non-profit and can't afford expensive digs when travelling.    The author and Lonely Planet state that Renakse Hotel in Phnom Penh costs $25-50/night.  I understand that hotel prices change over time, but prices I bought this book fresh off the press last month.  Prices at Renakse are now a whopping $76-100/night and they have been since the end of 2004.  The author's writing style is great, but you may want to pick up an older version of the book (4th edition seems just the same as this one when I read it before getting this one) and save the extra bucks.  
 I was really excited when I saw this DVD and really DEFLATED when I actually attempted to complete it!  The instructor gives relatively little if any INSTRUCTION on how to successfully complete moves; and she switches from combo to combo, move to move and it is virtually impossible to keep up.  I have also never sweated so much in my life, mostly from a rise in my blood pressure from anger and frustration!  I am in relatively good shape; I walk up to 3 miles a day and wanted this to break the routine.  In only broke my spirits!  Unless you are an accomplished club hopper or a trained hoofer, STAY AWAY!  One of the worst workouts I have ever seen 
 Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.  This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.  I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad 
 If you like neurotic self-involved women who never know how to gain control of their lives, this book is for you.  If not, just pass this by. I know she won all kinds of awards from her other books, but this is full of whining and self-pitty. In fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine. I couldn't even get past the first section and I'm a huge reader 
 There is a review further down this page that is purportedly written by the author. If this was indeed written by the author, he should be profoundly ashamed of himself.  This is what Michael Burleigh has written in the review below in regards to the criticism offered by one of his readers:   "In cyberspace every moron gets a coconut. One big electronic democracy? Many of my US readers appear to need dictionaries. People don't in the fifteen European countries my work is translated into. Nor did I as I wrote the English language. My book is about Europe. Maybe try living there before you presume to comment on it?"  This is one American who has no intention of putting any money in the pocket of someone who holds me and my fellow countrymen in such open and unbridled contempt. And you have to shake your head at the effrontery of the author as he rates his own book with 5 stars 
 There is so much scientific nonsense in the book that it is appalling! Working in the field of self-organized behavior in insects colonies, I can tell you that the presentation of that subject in the book is awful!  The number of wrong statement is so outrageously large that they are impossible to list below 10 pages of text!! It is a pity because such a book completely discredits a real scientific field that is confronted enough with new-age babble, scientific unfounded or wrong statements, pseudo-philosophical stupidities and so on. If you want to learn something real about "emergence" please stay away from this book. The rating of 1 star is just for the paper on which the book is written.. 
 This was the first Ludlum book I have read.  I bought several and now am thinking I've wasted my money.  He took a realistic story and destroyed it with an unbelievable plot.  All the bad guys, who have so much power that they can have anyone in the world killed within 24 hours of the victim hearing about the Secret Plot to control the World cannot even protect their top masterminds from being kidnapped by a New York lawyer, his consultant ex-wife, and a couple of low-level military officers.  Then, each bad guy willingly spills everything about the Secret Plot merely upon learning that one of his colleagues has insulted him?  Give me a break.  Don't even get me started on how unrealistic the relationship is b/w the main character and his ex-wife.  Give the book as a gift to your 12 year old nieces and nephews, but don't waste your time or money on this if you are over 12 years old 
 If you are looking for the Nickel Creek we listen to now, you will be sorely disappointed. However, If you want to hear the band when they were kids, this is for you. Even then, their talent was evident 
 Normally I read a book of this type in a day or two. This one took over two weeks because I couldn't get past reading a chapter or two at a time before I had to put it down.  Carolyn Blue may be the most stupid, irritating character to hit the cozy scene in a long time. She's pushy, nosy, condescending and flat out stupid. The whole book consisted of her eating and running around talking to people. The plot and the story never moved forward -- she just happened to show up at the murderer's place one time when he decided to let her in and confess.  Cross this author off your list, and save your money 
 I particularly liked Berg's "Open House" but was extremely disappointed with "Range of Motion."  The story begins when Lainey's husband, Jay, is hit on the head by ice falling from a building and is rushed to the hospital.  There he remains in a coma.  Lainey brings Jay's favourite things from home with the hope that scents, sounds, smells and feel of familiar things will help him come out of the coma.  The book seems to drag on forever and the characters have absolutely no substance or realistic quality. They remind me of wind-up toys going through the motions (maybe that is what prompted the title, "Range of Motion?)and feeling nothing.  Lainey's best friend, Alice, adds nothing to the book and the ghost of a woman who previously lived in Lainey's home is just too bizarre and far-fetched to be believable. The ending was predictable almost from page one.  What more can I say, "The booked is boring, dull, a chore to finish, and now sits in my compost bin. 
 It is not the Wonderful Twinings Earl Grey you have come to know and love.  They have pulled a "new coke" blunder and now the best Earl Grey tea ever is available no more!  This tea is weak and tasteless. I hate stupidity, especially from corporate marketers 
 Fans of the Beyond might want to watch this for the "Frankenstein-like" man living in the basement of a creepy old house in the woods. A little kid ends up in the cellar with horrible results. Most of the film is spent researching the history of the house and owner via audio recordings, as a few guests, including the babysitter discover the nightmare waiting below, who happens to be looking for bodyparts to add to his own body.  Some classic Fulci gore here and there amongst the very slow, drawn out story, and a great worm gut scene at the end.  Worth a look for gorehounds who don't mind a whiny kid. Fulci's "The Beyond" ranks way 'beyond' this however 
 This is one of the most uninteresting novels I have ever read.  There was nothing in the whole book that was worth reading.  The characters are so 1 dimensional that from the get go you can see through them all and wish you weren't reading the book.  I finished the novel, just to see if it ever redeems itself.  Please don't waste your time 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 This is a thoughtful book with lots of useful information on intuition.  The problem is that the print is so tiny, and I, being over 50 y.o., get eye strain trying to read it without a magnifying lens.  There are also  many typos, misspellings, misplaced commas, incomplete sentences, wrong  grammar, etc., that it reads more like an unedited first draft than a  finished product.  The material is worthwhile but I wish it could be  presented in a less physically painful format.  Clearly, the publisher did  not "already know what to do" with this text.  If it were more  readable, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars 
 This was a disappointing read.  An Indianized version of Bridget Jones 
 I generally like and admire Faulkner's work, but this novel (or whatever it is) got the better of me.  Usually I make myself finish any book I read no matter how difficult, but with "A Fable" I simply couldn't do  it (and I've managed the entirety of James Joyce's "Ulysses" and  Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past".)  I may have a Master's  Degree in English, but I still had great trouble following what was going  on in the book, much less appreciating what it was trying to say.  It's  amazing to me that the Pulitzer Prize committee could even manage to get  through this thing, much less give it an award.  I haven't given up on  Faulkner, but for the first time since I was a college undergraduate, I've  given up on a book.  It took "A Fable" to bring me to my knees 
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 One of the most important elements in a horror film is that the audience has to either, identify or care about the potential victim. In this case, I felt neither.  It's hard to be sympathetic towards people who are genuinely stupid. I'll explain. The girl in this film is being hunted by a deranged killer in a commercial pick-up truck. He steals her boyfriend away to take him to his gruesome and torturous demise. Once she realizes he is missing, she sticks around (all alone) in a deserted rest stop to get drunk on a bottle of whiskey that she discovers in a police officers desk. She calls for help and when a police officer arrives it turns out to be Joey Lawrence! Wough!! The killer runs over Joey and his death scene is acually quite comical. I can only hope the director was playing it for laughs because it is like something out of Monty Python. Joey is laying on a floor and he begs the girl to shoot him in the head to relieve him of his agonizing misery. She reluctantly agrees and sticks the pistol in his wide open flapper. She pulls the trigger and the next shot is Joey Lawrence laying on the ground with half his brains splattered on the floor telling her "You missed!, do it again" at that point I was waiting for John Cleese and Eric Idle to walk out and go into "The Lumberjack Song." This movie would be best viewed at Thanksgiving because it is one Freakin Big Turkey!!!!! 
 There was nothing in this book that was intesting or unusual from any other hip-hop, groupie encounter.  I do not like either of them, Nas or JayZ.  She put herself in the company of not only them, but several other guys, with seemingly only one thing in mind ----- how much sex and I give to make money to pay my bills and support my daughter.  I wasted money on this purchae 
 Young seems unaware of what has been going on in the world of New Testament scholarship for the past 50 years.  The only valuable part of the book consists of the later Jewish parallels 
 As part of a $250.00 order, I ordered the Michelin France Provence map in English, and the Michelin 2006 Red Guide France: Hotels and Restaurants in English - both Items they sent me were written in French, which are of no value to me.  I requested a shipping label to return the map and the book and asked they send me the English versions. The Amazon Outsourcing Desk in India refused both request.  I requested an American Amazon Customer Service Manager contact me on this Issue.  That has never happened.  I am also being asked my Satisfaction on a 3d book - Markets Of Provence - which they never sent me.  The remainder of my $250.00 order were the English Versions, as ordered.  My Overall Satisfaction:  Well below the 1 Star shown.  Actual Satisfaction "F Minus" for all departments in Amazon and far less for their very poor Customer Service and lack of ethical follow-up for their mistake 
 If TomTom's maps fail and you submit a bug report, the nice support site sends you to TeleAtlas's site which promptly CLOSES the support request.  It took two requests before I realized I was being redirected away from TomTom's site.  The real problem is not with the maps (which is a good thing), but with the mapping engine (determine how to find a point on a map).  I submit the request to the main support group only to have those bozos close the request saying that the problem is with the map.  At this point I don't care who is wrong since neither TomTom nor TeleAtlas will say who owns the mapping engine.  This stupid device failed when I needed it the most, driving in New Jersey! The TomTom Go 300 cannot map roads that are broken, see bug submission below for more information.  So, why two stars? - It fails when you need it - I could scroll around the working map and find the right street, but then I need to stop in an unsafe state .. er .. I mean place and use the device like it was my trusty AAA map. - Support does not read bug reports (I want that job with zero accountability please!)  Does it work? Yes it does and it does work very well when you have a nice clean streets with a good map.  It does take some time to find its GPS often, but its tolerable. It manages to lose signal with tree cover (seriously, I can still see the sky).  Moral of this review: verify with an online map service BEFORE driving to unknown places.  Defeats the prupose? No.  TomTom Go 300 did find my way around some detours in NJ near Trenton and get me into the parking garage saving me time and frustration (the prupose of this device).  Updates: After using TomTom Go 300 for a few months I have seen more problems than I care for.  I have recommended everyone in my family to not buy TomTom products.  The map for my area, King of Prussia, PA more than two years out of date.  It got my dad lost going to a hotel which is 1.3 miles away from me.  In some areas, you will fall off the map.  The most annoying new feature is TomTom alterate route functions.  I am headed to a fork in a road in the middle of nowhere.  TomTom wants me to take the "long" way to my destination by switching from the State Route (meaning Route 1 or Route 66) that I'm on to the another State Route at the fork.  The thing is, if I tell it not to take the other State Route, the damn device will tell me to turn around!!  Once I pass the fork it keeps telling me to turn around.  When I choose to re-run the routing software from where I am, it figures out a new route completely passing the road that I need to take.  The road is on the TomTom map, but it won't take it until I get on to it.  WHAT GIVES?  Bug Report submitted to TomTom ------- TomTom Go 300 v6.150 The mapping engine is BROKEN.  It cannot handle a road that is broken into several non-contiguous sections.  The city, Pennsauken, gave several distinct streets the SAME name!  Destination: 3401 Cooper Ave, Pennsauken, NJ 08109   If you map the destination on any Internet site and scroll around, you would see that:  [...] All points map to real locations but are not on the same physical road.  They are on different roads by the same name in the same city.  The TomTomGo 300's map actually has these locations on it, but is UNABLE to map to anything but the first OCCURANCE of Cooper Ave: 7200 Cooper Ave, Pennsauken, NJ 08109  Trying to find the intersection (cross street) of two streets Cooper Ave and Park Ave does not work even though the TomTom's map clearly shows that they do intersect.  TomTom can only see the intersection of Cooper Ave and Derousse Ave.  That area has several other streets, Sherman Ave for example, that are also non-contiguous 
 This book was obviously slapped together as quickly as possibly to take advantage of the (at that time) rapidly emerging Microchip PIC market.  A significant amount of it is completely irrelevant or even misleading material which apparently was copied from the author's previous books about completely different processors.  Another large part is just verbatim copies of free Microchip literature.    Of the material that appears to be original, there is in my opinion too much opinion and anecdote.  This is debatable, as some readers will prefer a "chatty" style.  Worse, however, there are many, many errors, something on the order of one per page. (!)  Some are editing problems such as typographical and grammar errors, but a distressingly large number show a real lack of understanding of his subject material.  I feel the author's "I'm so smart" attitude comes through as well, and is particularly annoying when combined with the above.  The PCB and code included for building a programmer don't work -- more evidence of rushing to publish.  In his defense, he has posted "updates" on his web site which address this problem, but as I understand it they require a lot of changes and don't completely solve the problems of the original design, which he has abandoned in favor of another.  This is a sufficiently unprofessional effort that would I regard with great suspicion any other of the author's many similar works.  It was more than a waste of my money -- it was a waste of time and sanity.  I'd pay to never have seen it. 
 If you want a guidebook that is filled with smirking insider speak about trendy establishments, faddish bars and alternative shopping locales-du-jour, with random lists of so-called "cool" places, and smug reassurances that only pedestrian tourists "ooh" and "aah" at Gastown and take pictures of the totem poles outside of Stanley Park, then this is the guidebook for you.   If you want something a bit more organized and useful, get a real travel guide to Vancouver. The maps in this one are poor, the "lowdown" lists will have you traipsing wildly all over the city without a sense of Vancouver's "highlights," and the most fundamental of city navigation tips don't appear until p. 203 of a 214-page book.   With it's "Irreverent" (maybe better dubbed "Irrelevant"?) guides Frommer's has found a clever way to increase market share with assurances readers will feel like their being led around the city by a "savvy local." Instead, I felt like I wasn't being led at all. There's a reason travel advice should be left to the travel professionals.   Self-important and cliquish, this book is -- helpful guidebook it ain't. 
 The three stories are quite uneven, being the Wan Kar Wai's segment the most interesting: well acted, well photographed and with a kind of catchy story line. However, the other too are a wonderful invitation to sleep. The Steven Soderbergh tale is awfully dull and nothing really interesting happens. The Antonioni piece is the most disappointing one, not only for being the worst but for being Anyonioni's. It's absolutely pointless and confusing; in many instances, it seems to be an amateurish test from a lazy cinema student. It's a pity it's Antonioni's since his reputation deserves more than this. Only for the Wan Kar Wai piece, I give this movie 2 stars 
 This book is a big check-list.  Do not buy it if you are actually looking for building code information.  However, it would probably be useful to contractors who want to be sure they have covered all bases.  (I gave it two stars because it was not useful for me.

 I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.   Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie.  This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch 
 The Executed God covers an important and controversial issue, but it did not rise to the task. I expected to be challenged by the author's approach, yet his methodology left me feeling ill used. Taylor's tone and presentation hindered his message. I found many of his arguments superficial for such a weighty subject. His use of Mumia Abu-Jamal echoed the cries of too many Hollywood elite. They know little of the facts of the case as available to criminal justice professionals, and they trust what Abu-Jamal says despite evidence and conflicts in his statements. Facts don't matter, only emotional responses. I expected more from a theologian and academic from Princeton. Instead, I felt as if I was reading propaganda. References to "gulag America," the "theatrics of terror," "big house nation," "lockdown America," and the like further confirmed this. I am well aware there are many injustices in our (and any) political system, and I am open to the possibile abolition of the death penalty. Yet, his use of these terms and method of argument make me suspect the merit and academic value of his work. I wanted a thoughtful, challenging examination of the issue. Instead, I got annoid 
 If your looking for an autobiography of someones life then this is the book for you.  But if your buying the book to learn the darvas system of the stock market then this is not the book for you.  I gave this book a 1 star rating because the book jacket said that the book contained information about nicolas darvas' system for profiting in the market.  But nowhere in this book does he give you any information about it or how to use it. It sounds like all he did was buy a stock that was in a strong uptrend and then bought it when it passed the resistance level.  Nicholas also gained most of his money when he bought a cheap stock on a wim for maybe 5 or 10 dollars and it shot up in price overnight and was restricted for anymore trading.  He ended up selling for 171 dollars a share and sold for a profit of 250,000.  His idea of buying resistance is nothing new and it sounds like he was lucky more than anything else.  
 This publication has no business calling itself a "magazine"; published by San Diego book distributor American Marketing Servies, this is nothing more than a fluffy info-mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo. Don't waste your money 
 Very simple. I expected a better contribution in the field of science per se; and i found that is oriented to ethics. Regards, Madya Ayal 
 What a disappointment.  I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.  But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series.  It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel:  despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.  This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about. 
 The code examples in this book simply do not work. You have to rely on other books and looking up things yourself on the internet to get the examples working. If I wanted to do that, I wouldn't have bought THIS book!!  Its thourogh in its coverage of DX9, but so are a lot of other books that have code that actually compiles. Don't waste your money. A programming book with programming examples that don't actually work is like a cookbook without any actual recipes. Useless 
 Slate magazine's little item might not be bad, if somebody else hadn't done it better, years earlier.  Since the 1970s, the Chicago Reader Newspaper has had a column called "The Straight Dope" by Cecil Adams, which provides more accurate information, better writing, & more witty reparte'. The Straight Dope online website has frequently made "PC Magazine"'s list of "Top 101 Websites", & Random House's "Rough Guide To The Internet" lists it as one of the best general information sites on the Web.  Don't settle for this poor copy--go search under Author's Name : "Cecil Adams" in Advanced Search, & buy one of several collection of the better product 
 Unless you have a very small and old TV, don't buy it. The picture quality is very bad, no sharpness, blurred video. I don't know if it was just a dvd production problem affecting few copies or because this concert was recorded in Europe and there were problems in the PALM to NTSC translation, but even in the first case you still have a chance of getting a bad copy 
 The good news is that the money went to an excellent cause. The bad news is that the choice of artists and songs were not, in my opinion, worth listening to 
 Not well organized, arbitrary, puffed up, dense. If writing well is writing simply and clearly, this writing gets a D. The book is  fraught with tautologies and contradictions not to mention simply not matching reality. It reminds me of the products of academic careerism at their worst 
 Bought this for my 3 year old daughter who really uses it a lot daily.  The level of edutainment is excellent for her age and she learns a lot from it.  My only sore point with it is the lack of strength of the perforated part of the pages (for the spiral binding).  The pages tend to be separated there so I think it will be a good idea to strenghten the perforated part of the book or to use some other form of binding that will not decrease the overall strength 
 I'm shocked that having spent, (what was it?) $200 Million, they couldn't have at least employeed a writer/director who cared about the original medium, Comics, and that pre-existing fanbase. I wouldn't be complaining, but to base it off of the original films, and then ignore so many gems that made the original films enjoyable, simply left a lot to be desired. I feel looking back, that the writers simply wanted to reach non-fans by writing a 'cutting-edge' 'non-traditional' Superman story. It wasn't necessary.  Lastly, while I love Lex Luthor, I found it a shame they chose to keep the Version of Lex who is a Real-Estate Obsessed Super-Villian, who lacks forethought.  I'm beginning to think the heads of WB don't know of any other villians for Supes to fight.  Most shocking is that they signed the writer's up for a trilogy deal, before this movie even hit theaters 
    At the height of socialist popularism in England, cir. 1944,  George Orwell, a leading proponent of socialism, believing in its promises as did many,if not most of Eurpose's leading intellectuals and politicians, wrote a review of Hayek's famous book, "The Road to Serfdom."  Orwell wrote the review in the "Observer," London April 9,1944.    Hayek, mentions this fact as a footnote in chapter 17 of his classic book, "The Constitution of Liberty" published in 1960, as evidence of the disillusionment of socialist intellectuals, when they were confronted with the observation that individualism and socialism were mutually exclusive. Those same intellectuals had not accepted the proposition when advanced by Karl Mannheim in his book, "Man and Society in an Age of Reconstrucion" (1940).  Mannheim had been a long opponent of socialism, but Orwell had only been converted after being exposed to "The Road to Serfdom."  By 1960, when Orwell had become a world renowned author and staunch opponent of Big Brother doublespeak, Hayek recognized that the political proponents of socialsm which was dying as a political ideal, were now introducing the concept of the welfare state.       While virtually everyone alive today have been effected by Orwell's works and his prescient warnings about Big Brother, how many of us are aware of Hayek's infulence on him?       "The Constitution of Liberty" provides its readers with an enormous wealth of knowledge, of which this one footnote is only a small example.  Each reader is bound to be effected in one way or another by the knowledge imparted to them, and this is one of the main lessons to be learned about "liberty" which requires the "rule of Law" to exist in today's society, but that Rule of Law must be understood.  The failure of today's inteligencia is to fail to fully comprehend the meaning of liberty and its necessity in a world full of confusion from the confrontation of competing civilizations.       Unfortunately, Hayek is no longer alive to help guide us through the new millenium.  Fortunately, he has left us a large volume of work, perhaps more relevant today than it was when written years ago.  While "The Constitution of Liberty" is voluminous in itself, it should be kept as a reference book.  Hayek's other works, "The Road to Serfdom" and his last published volume, "Fatal Conceit-the Evils of Socialism" published in 1980 is a magnificent continuation of Hayek's life long discertation on the evolution of mankind's growth from a tribal, familial society which did not require man to understand or protect Liberty, to a group of city-states that prospered because of the Liberties protected in Athens, but only moderately understood, so that such a great and wise philosopher as Aristotle would believe that freedom could only exist as far as a man could yell.    Hayek's understanding that Western Civilization has prospered from individualism, that it has grown and prospered from the freedom to travel, to trade, to exchnge property, material, real and intellectual.  He explains why man must be humble, that humans progress from trial and error, not from conceited belief that one way or another way is correct.  That to be free and liberated is to be free to make mistakes and government should exist to protect individuals'rights to make mistakes while they attempt to profit in their own ideals and beliefs.      
 I have the same issues everyone else is having...except that ours seems to work pretty well outside (as long as you stay relatively close to the car).  However, as soon as I step inside our house, nothing.  Not sure if it is just a bunch of interference from satellite receivers, etc.  But we will be taking this back 
 I have to say this is the first book review I've writen, I just haven't been compelled to write any reviews.  After reading this book I changed my mind.  I was so utterly DISGUSTED by this author's total irresponsible treatment of her dogs.  I have read many books about dog behavior and I thought I would get a little more insight from this book.  How wrong was I?  I finished the book out of sheer determination.  I read all the reviews written for this book and all of the negative ones are true.  She let her dogs run wild through busy streets, she did not spay or neuter any of her dogs, had many unwanted puppies (which she allowed her dogs to kill), and the list goes on.  This was not a scientific experiment it was neglect and abuse.  If you would like an insightful/refreshing book about dog behavior that does not involve irresponsible ownership/guardianship buy Patricia McConnell's "The Other End of the Leash. 
 Kant is a genius; I give him that.  Still, his primary problem is that he presupposes in all his philosophy that there can be nothing beyond the natural and material world.  His aesthetics suffer as he tries to find a completely "objective" way of interpreting and appreciating the arts.  Not only does this not work in theory, but every human knows empirically that music, sunsets, and Monet are simply not capable of being interpreted completely void of feeling or pleasure 
 I ordered these, and several other movies from the Tyler Perry Collection, only to find that they were not actual movies but on-stage plays. I returned them and was charged a high restocking fee. Not OK! No where in the description was mention of them being stage plays. I will order my CD's and DVD's from another source in the future. 
 ...unless it is rock and roll played by ac/dc. i f***ing HATE them. they are overplayed so much on the radio, and that is the most annoying voice i have ever heard in my life. don't waste your money on this cd, just turn on the radio...then turn it off 
 I didn't know this book would list the dumb things to do before you die.  I'll pass on the bog swimming, testicle festivals and penis parades for the real eventss I don't want to miss like the Balloon Fiesta.  
 This movie was very much like American Beauty, except it was a little better. This kind of dark comedy is made for white men who have lost their souls to the modern American life. But for all other people, including myself, Fight Club was not that good. And I GET the movie. I am a consumer, like most Americans. But not to a degree where I can relate to Jack who is the main character. Starting a fight club to re-discover masculinity or one's identity is an absurd idea. What is sad is the fact that so many white men are facinated by the whole idea of Fight Club. No wonder the only people that joins the Fight Club in the movie are white males. No wonder that the only real people in my life that I saw raving about this movie so far has been all "white men". The movie does speak one truth. Modern American life  has reached a point of sickness that a movie like this drawn a significant number of fans. Like I said, I have not come to that point yet and I do plenty of things to make my life significant and meaningful. People should build a family, serve their community, and make real friends to live a happy and significant life. Fight Club is not necessary unless you really became like Jack. Do not watch this movie unless you are white male. Watch if you are really curious, but it will be a waste of time 
 In Sylvia's third book of her Journey of the Soul series I felt her message was really starting to get diluted.  By time I finished this book I began to get the feeling that it was written just to sell more books.  Much of it was information repeated from the other books, with a few more stories added from her own experience.  It is also filled with countless meditations which all basically are used for the same purpose.  To cleanse the soul, heal, and rid it of negativity.  I get the feeling she is going to come out with a book of meditations which, once again will be gathered from those in this series.  This will add to her pocket book nicely.  But before you get the impression I think this is all about greed let me say that I agree with many of her tenants, which was why I continued to read her books.  Some of these include the fact that God exists in all of us, we do not need an intermediary to reach God, and that we all create our own Hell on earth.  Some of the inconsistancies I found in the book stand out like a sore thumb.  For one, on page 120 she quotes Genesis 1:26 "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness."  She uses this quote to support the idea that Mother God and Father God both exist, not just a male God.  Thus the Our, and Us, in the quote.  But then on page 122 she goes on to say "The Old Testament is a collection of teaching stories, but certainly not the word of God.  So, my question is which way is it?  Are we suppose to take this literal interpretation in Genesis as the Word of God?  There is also a false statement on page 110 when she is refering to her church she says "This is the first time in 2000 years that we're merging a belief in reincarnation into Christianity."  This is not true at all since Charles Fillmore, over 100 years ago became a co-founder of Unity faith which does indeed merge the two.  A strange statement from a woman who claims to be such a student of Religions of various faiths.  In conclusion I don't dismiss all she says but she is beginning to get a bit stale.  It is a fairly good book if you are curius enough 
 I purchased 2 sets of these earphones for a 2 hour flight. My husband and I both used them, and we both took them out of our ears after 20 minutes. They were great at first, but after 20 minutes they really started to hurt our ears. The inside of my ears were so sore I couldn't even adjust the earphones when they started coming out, that's how bad my ears hurt. I had the foam pad over them too, and it made no difference. I would not recommend these 
 Hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it.  Easily assembled, up within 60 seconds. I have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway, presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground. There was no rope or stakes with the purchase, I am unaware if these should have been included. Two entrances into the hideaway, the front inverted T entrance is great. However, the rear is a porthole type entrance, not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom. Material not that durable, but with care there should be no issues. a lot bigger than it looks on the site, which was a nice surprise. 
 After more than 2 months waiting I ordered it somewhere els 
 The book was a copy of the textbook. The print quality is so bad it looks like the words are disappearing in front of your eyes. 
 Sorry for the sarcasm, but I can't help thinking just how uninspired this book is.  Imagine a counter to this book.  This book would promote "hate", "dishonesty", "immorality", "ignorance, "ingratitude".... you get the picture.  This Mormon leader's great contribution to world is to say we should be honest?  Now that was profound!  Sadly, Gordo and his wrinkled cadre have this bad habit of taking the basic decency of the members of the church and attributing it to the implausible myths they peddle to the world.   As an avowed atheist, I encourage everyone to be honest, moral, learned, and all the things Gordo promotes in this book.  There is nothing wrong with promoting these and they have nothing to do with Mormonism.  But this book is written for children and sheep.  Promoting this book among the various books that seriously discuss morality, ethics and other serious issues is like watching a high school team play the New England Patriots or comparing a Janice Kapp Perry vapid song to Bach's Mass in B minor.    Mormonism is declining in real terms because their leadership does not have the capacity to address and provide any illumination to the relevant issues of the 21st century.  This book should confine itself to the children's section or to the local Deseret Book store.   
 Clipped, petite and looking more like a leather bar Anne Murray, Crow drags out the hits and the `friends' for this all-star live bash. Half the album is standard issue and straight ahead stage sweat with the morning beer-buzz afficiando going it alone without a little help from her friends (All I Wanna Do, Everyday Is a Winding Road, A Change Would Do You Good, Leaving Las Vegas). With only slight variations on these overplayed originals (a sychopantic crowd and some tinkering with the rhythms) Crow's solo chores rarely rate more than a grudging ho-hum. The rest of the album is a parade of snap-on tools (Dixie Chicks, Stevie Nicks, Eric Clapton, Sarah McLachlan, Chrissie Hynde) who easily steal the spotlight from their downhome hash-slinging waitress/host. Reduced to the role of supporting guitarist, Crow butters the toast from the sidelines as femme contemporaries like Nicks (who unravels admirably on Gold Dust Woman), Hynde and McLachlan flounder about the mike in a haphazard hit (Hynde's If It Makes You Happy)-and-miss (McLachlan's The Difficult Kind) headbutt at Crow's hits. But it isn't until Clapton's suspendered, cigar-chomping husk is rolled out to update Cream's White Room that the sour stench of monstrous micalculation reaches it's devastating climax. Fresh from watering the daisies and still in his jammies, Clapton's return to the electric psychedelics of his Paleolithic past  is a fumbling bumbling fiasco unleashed with the grace and finesse of a diarrhetic Brontosaurus. It's horrifying to think that this is what Cream would have sounded like if they hadn't broken up. Thank God for egos. It's almost a relief to hear Richards mindlessly croak his way through the old Stones Exile-era toss-off Happy, as if a cadaverous ex-junkie with the durability of a cockroach and nine lives would be anything but. Besides, Richards provides wonderful comic relief and criticizing his artistic capacity is as futile as pointing out the flaws in the bandages on an Egyptian mummy. The wrapper finds the entire gang, from Spanky Nicks to Buckwheat Clapton, joining hands for a bizarre entreaty with a kindergarten  rendition of Dylan's Tombstone Blues - a fitting finale if there ever was one 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 I watched ten minutes of Beanie Seagal trying to act and turned my DVD player off to read a book.  I had to.  I felt like I was getting dumber by the minute for watching that short segment of the movie. It looked so common I didn't even need to see the rest to tell you the end. I'm willing to bet some people got shot, somebody got away with the crime, the police arrested Beanie, and somebody's mother was yelling at somebody. I don't even care if I'm right or wrong because regardless, I'm not gonna finish watching this movie 
 When I got this book to study for the GRE, I thought it would be great. I memorized the list using flashcards and reviewing them daily. I was pumped.   Then i took the test and my experieince corroborates the two reviews immediately below: NONE of these words were on the test! When I took the GRE a few years ago (that time for my Masters degree), I used a Kaplan vocabulary book and, as I recall, its word list was more represented on the GRE. In addition, it's layout was a bit better.   This book is quite simply a list of words and definitions (without pronunciation keys) interspersed with a few quizzes to test you. By contrast, Kaplan's book, while similar, had things like pronunciation keys (it is easier to memorize words you can pronounce), more creative quizzes, and a nicer layout (words went from easier to harder, rather than straight alphabetical.)  All in all, I've been disappointed with Princeton Review more times than once, and I would reccomend vocab and verbal books by Kaplan over PR any day. This is no exception. 
 Exactly just how many "greatest hits" albums are going to be released from this greatest band of the 80's?  Do we really need so many different CDs with the same songs on them?  How about getting some of those videos ("Single Vision", "Into The Gap Live", etc) digitally remastered onto DVD!! 
 The problem with all Indian cultural analysts living outside India including those writing on cinema is that while they fulfill a mandatory understanding of the cultural theories in vogue at the undergraduate level  in the US, Europe and Australia, they display a singular lack of  sensitivity while dealing with the material at hand. Their survival,  therefore, depends almost entirely on their reader's lack of knowledge of  the field of study which will include amongst other things the native  language, the local history as well as the local lores. On all these counts  Ms Chakravarty's book is sadly lacking in a defined sincerity of purpose.  There are pieces of information which cannot bear testimony - the  relationship of Ali Akbar Khan with the Navketan Productions, for one.  There are descriptions - such as the music composer SD Burman being  described as a baul singer - which are downright ridiculous. And, of  course, her command of the Hindi language is unquestionably poor! Surely  the West and the East deserve a better introduction to the Indian cinema  than this book 
 Once you start straying outside of the confines of the modern rock or metal genres that are forced into your ears by the radio, Fuse, Alternative Press, and webzines more concerned with pushing their own agendas then promoting good music, you'll find yourself exposed to all sorts of subgenres that explore every possible niche of music that you could imagine. One such subgenre you might venture into is that of noise rock or noisecore. To most, this subgenre will seem like, as the name implies, noise, but once given a chance you'll find there is a definite pattern and method to the madness that you previously only viewed as noise. Sonic Youth, Hella, and Gore Beyond Necropsy are all wonderful examples of bands that are able to shape noise into music. Go check them out when you get a chance. They're really swell.  ...and then there's The Chariot. Plain and simple, they just make noise. To be perfectly clear, The Chariot don't technically fall into the same subgenre as the aforementioned bands, but they do share the same type of schizophrenic nature that drives their creative process. You could most easily lump The Chariot into the same category of bands that Every Time I Die and Norma Jean occupy, but that's where the comparisons should end. Whereas Every Time I Die create a unique start/stop, shifting brand of metalcore, The Chariot just start, stop, shift gears, do something weird, and then move on. The biggest problem that The Fiancé has is the lack of direction that nearly all of the songs possess.  Each song, at times, feels like it's going somewhere, but yet it never reaches the endpoint that it's shooting for. More often than not you'll get the feeling that the band simply gives up before they get where they're trying to go, leaving songs underdeveloped and lacking. This can easily be evidenced in the brevity of the majority of the 10 tracks on this effort - most of them clock in at only 2-3 minutes in length. The one song that actually feels developed is also the longest -- "Then Came to Kill". At five minutes in length and containing multiple build-ups, a gentle fadeout, and a nicely layered sound, this is what the rest of the effort should have sounded like. Unfortunately all you get with the remainder of the disc is short chunks of what could be fleshed out into full songs, if only given the chance.  Take, for example, "The Two Dead Boys". The introduction and first "verse" of the song gallop along in a heavy metalcore style, but then the band switches gears completely, needlessly noodling around followed by a natural fadeout that could actually work as the song's endpoint, but then they come back with squeaking, moving guitars for 30 more seconds. This last piece adds nothing to the song and ruins one of the only times a short ending felt appropriate. Are they purposely trying to annoy their listeners? It could be worse, though, it could have been a repeat of the song "They Drew Their Swords". Or even worse, it could have been another church choir song, like the closing track "The Trumpet". Totally out of place on this album, this song doesn't help make the album any more digestible.  With the direction The Chariot had taken on their EP, Unsung, there was a feeling that the band was starting to decide what they wanted to do and could possibly hone their talents to create a strong, non-traditional metalcore album. Unfortunately with all of the lineup changes and an obvious focus on being more "out there", The Fiancé falls flat and leaves the band looking like they've actually become less mature as time has passed 
 Like other reviewers, I found MeetThe Parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for $25 bin at Hollywood so I figured "Why not?" Well here's why not. It presents the main character's parents as crude, clueless buffoons, and having no social judgement whatsoever, but it seems the writers want the audience to think of them as cool and hip. And for some odd reason they live in a house that resembles the castle on Fantasy Island. I'm surprised they didn't include a sex with a midget scene. Nobody would want their daughter to marry into this family let alone a right wing former CIA agent, who was set up as an object of ridicule. Oh, and they had to be Jewish too. Streisand and Hoffman should be ashamed of themselves portraying their own people in such an unflattering way. {"Our people don't shoot ducks, dear") Do former CIA agents make enough money to live in mansions and buy a custom built RV that would cost at least $250 k? The toilet humor and profanity wouldn't have made it into "Dumb and Dumber" Nothing reedeming or funny here. Fuhgeddaboutit 
 Very easy to set up, but no matter what I did, I got several horizontal interference bars.  One very nice feature is a built in video modulator that allows you to connect to older TVs using a coax cable instead of RCA.  I am returning this product 
 I admit first off that I did not read this entire book - I flipped it open to a page at random in the bookstore today, and the first thing I read was instructions on how a girl could give a boy a B*ow J*b.    If that's what you want for your daughter, knock yourself out, but it sure won't be bought by my family 
 7 out of the 25 disks would not write.  I didnt much care for the product considering this factor.  
 I agree with many of the other reviewers.  This book is 90% filler.  Instead of discussing the topic at hand, we are repeatedly bombarded with a desciption of the weather, the El Paso fiesta season, etc...  This is a story about a group of (in my opinion, uninteresting) characters, and not a book on Investing or Science.  Not recommended 
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 I worked my way through this,and kept asking myself why. This book is the product of a certain mind set in this country that props up certain points of views and tries to silence others, there simply is no other way to explain how this got published and, pick my jaw up off the floor, a movie made.  The writing is totally uninspired. Likewise the, uhh...plot. If there is a character, meaningful dialog, descriptive passage somewhere in this thing, please invite my attention. Swofford accomplishes only one thing: makes you real happy you don't have to spend time with him other than when you are struggling with his book. It doesn't matter how you feel about war, politics, life, or anything, this is just hard labor. Yes, I've done my time in the military and in combat. Swofford can't tell anyone anything, about the Corps, any military, combat, life, or putting one foot in front of another each day. Sadly, I think that this is a tragedy, because he had the opportunity to experience much, some of it even positve, but he missed it all. The people who put their names on the cover of this book and gave it favorable comment are dispicable 
 they have no talent and are extremely bland to listen t 
 JS CONCERT WAS THE MOST BORING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN ON DVD! MY CAT WAS MORE INTERESTED IN WATCHING IT THEN I WAS, AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF JESSICA'S FRILLY COSTUMES! THE SOUND SYSTEM STANK! I WAS EXPECTING HER VOICE TO ECHO LIKE CRAZY. ALL OF JESSICA'S SONGS WERE ABOUT EXPRESSING HER LOVE FOR NICK. THIS DVD IS SO BORING I'M FALLING ASLEEP JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT.  OH YEAH...HER VOCALS WERE TOO BREATHY, THAT PINK THING SHE WORE LOOKED LIKE A FLAMINGO CAUGHT IN A SHREDDER, AND SHE SHOULD HAVE LEFT TAKE MY BREATH AWAY ALONE!  NICK DIDN'T TAKE HER BREATH AWAY SHE TOOK HIS WHEN SHE DECIDED TO WALK OUT OF THEIR MARRIAGE! NICK WILL BE SINIGING I'M TAKING HALF AWAY!, AND JESSICA WILL BE SINGING I SHOULD HAVE PRENUP 
 The Ice Reich began with enough subtle intrigue to convince the reader that maybe, just maybe, Dietrich had created a good pot boiler of a WWII novel.  Unfortunately by page 100, all has been lost.  The authors biggest road block seems to be his tin ear for dialogue - mostly between the male and female lead.  His heavy use of melodrama is overbearing. The time period is ripe with fasinating characters, but Dietrich chooses to go with the stock Nazi's who's only purpose is to "defend the reich" at all costs. Final act borders on preposterous. There is a scene in the sub where the male and female lead make love while being depth charged. It is about the corniest thing ever laid to parer.  Skip this one for a good Jack Higgins - "Eagle Has Landed" or "Night Of The Fox" 
 Gary Sicks' bizarro theory that George Bush flew to Paris in an SR-71 to meet with the Iranians to convince them to keep the hostages until after the election in 1990 is just plain crazy.  Congress investigated this and found no basis for Sicks account.  This is better fiction though than most spy stories but no one should take this silliness seriously 
 I was not thrilled with this work.  Here's why:  The movie jumps about in non-logical fashion that distracts from the flow.  It is beautifully filmed with great costumes, colors, imagery but the acting is so bland, almost weak!  Christ, I wanted to jump in there and show them how to be passionate! The sex scenes were boring.  Maybe i should make films!  This is frustrating!! It had it's moments so, 2 stars.  Wish someone would make a movie about 'Narcissus and Goldmund' or 'Cloister and the Hearth'.  Now That would be Passionate! (unless Amblin or Touchstone did it). 
 It simply didn't work for me.If you are beginner, you need more than this little book.The Screenwriter bible by David Trottier is the ONE.Do not expect to write any good stories in 21 days.Stop dreaming and start writing.This book is kind of hard to read so if it's for beginner, it is just done to to make your learning more difficult than anything else. Forget it and follow my advice above 
 This book presents an exhaustive synthesis and systematization of what is more accurately termed "Neo-Sindarin": that is, an altered, synthetic form of Sindarin not as Tolkien ever conceived of it but instead as cobbled together by Salo himself through selective re-use and modification of attested Noldorin forms (which in fact form the vast bulk of the evidence for Salo's "Sindarin") in admixture with actual Sindarin forms and with forms wholly invented by the author. As such, the book misrepresents itself (throughout, and even in its very title) to anyone looking for a reliable examination and presentation of Tolkien's own Sindarin, but if the actual nature of Salo's "Sindarin" is borne in mind throughout, and if the reader assiduously checks the sources against all of Salo's claims and (supposed) data (that is, where the data are not fabricated by Salo, and to the extent allowed by Salo's sparse and often misleading citation of sources), this book can be useful for the student as an introduction to a more accurate and detailed study of Tolkien's own Sindarin 
 Julian Simon won a famous ten-year-long bet with Paul Erlich regarding the prices of certain resources in the 1980's, which Simon predicted would decline in real terms. If Simon hadn't died a few years ago and he had made a similar set of bets with someone starting in 1995 for resources like Atlantic cod, copper, nickel, natural gas in North America and petroleum, by 2005 he would have lost, and spectacularly so. Apparently Simon's model for "unlimited" resources has begun to break down. The increasingly strained world oil supply shows that throwing more ingenuity and money at a resource problem can't always solve it. For example, despite having access to petroleum and natural gas from the North Sea, with the double-digit decline in North Sea output the British government has plans for _rationing_ fossil fuels this winter (2005-06) in the event of prolonged frigid weather.   And why do people keep referring to the Simon/Ehrlich bet any way? It doesn't follow from that contest that things haven't gone awry now.   As for the reviewer who blames government regulations and environmentalists for our current resource constraints, consider the following:  1. The world consumes a billion barrels of oil every 12 days or so at the current rate, up by 20 percent from a decade ago. If environmentalists and government regulators have tried to interfere with the growth of this flow of petroleum, they have clearly failed.  2. Much of our oil comes from parts of the world with few or no environmental restrictions. Even within the U.S., people along the Gulf Coast live with a level of petroleum-derived pollution and environmental damage that the rest of the country wouldn't tolerate.   3. Evolutionary psychologists will tell you that when people experience economic anxiety, they often blame other tribes for the resource problems they helped to cause themselves. If you feel anxious about having to pay twice as much for natural gas or gasoline as you did a couple years ago, look in the mirror for the reason instead of blaming caricatures from the Right's demonology 
 Why 2 stars instead of just 1?  Well, there are some interesting points and his style is entertaining at times.  Brian McLaren starts off with a number of questions...ok...probably more questions than necessary to "provoke" his readers into a response...or at least to get them to start thinking.  On page 4, I do like a question that indeed ought to be a recurring theme in the life of everyone who claims to be a Christian and that is:  "What if his [Jesus] secret message had practical implications for such issues as how you live your daily life, how you earn and spend money, how you treat people of other races and religions...?"  The question goes on of course, but I choose to focus on the first part of that question, and that is, what if the actual true Gospel message of Christ...not some "secret.," some esoteric hidden knowledge...was so important and so crucial to your understanding and outlook on life that you allowed it to sink down deep into your soul and change you, transform you into a new creature?    A bit later on page 4, McLaren also asks, "what if the message of Jesus was good news--not just for Christians but also for Jews, Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, new agers, agnostics, and atheists?"  Ah yes, it is good news for the world but alas the world does not receive Him.  1 John 5:10 (If we have faith in God's Son, we have believed what God has said. But if we don't believe what God has said about his Son, it is the same as calling God a liar.  Contemporary English Version-CEV).    In chapter 2, McLaren basically states that whatever he, you or I believe or understand, we can only perceive it, whatever the "it" is, through our own "interpretive grid."  So, is he saying that we cannot overcome our own bias?  That we can't know truth?  He regularly alludes to that "fact" in this book.  So somehow, there is truth, people can be on a journey or a quest to "uncover" the "truth," but if anyone claims or holds to the idea that the truth is knowable  must be insincere and lacking humility.  I'm sorry but, I don't buy it.  I think the author is biased to have such a view.    On page 39, McLaren states:  "In conversation after conversation, then, Jesus resists being clear or direct."  At the end of the next paragraph he continues this theme with:  "Frankly, few experts seem to even notice this pattern of unclarity, of hiddenness, of secrecy-and those who do tend to offer answers that don't ring true, for me anyway."  Jesus used a method of teaching that was very clear and direct to the hearers.  He spoke using stories that people could easily relate to and identify with; he spoke in colorful, vivid language that provoked thought.  Jesus isn't "hiding" anything.  As God incarnate, Jesus uses story and what Brian McLaren identifies as "hidden" messages to provoke his audience into thinking for themselves, to come to an understanding of who He is.  As a matter of fact, there are times where, although Jesus uses a parable or metaphor, the message is very clear indeed.  Think about how Jesus told his disciples that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go to heaven.    On page 51, the reader will stumble across perhaps a bit of McLaren's philosophical (postmodern) outlook in that our current/ present reality is constructed, that our worldview is a set of beliefs, images, metaphors, ideas etc. that "we inherit and construct."  He states that "As we go through life, many of us find it next to impossible even to want to question our inherited worldview, while others do exactly that: we sometimes experience radical conversions out of one worldview into another."  So, anyone who would like to disagree with such a statement would be a person NOT willing to question their view?  Or is it only applied to those who disagree with such a statement of truth?  Indeed, we all ought to experience a radical conversion from one worldview to another and that is the conversion from the philosophies and ideas of this world, into the mind of Christ through His work on the cross at Calvary.    The first 2 paragraphs on page 52 are basically a complaint against modernism (of which there are valid issues and concerns with modernism), however, in this, McLaren argues that we in the "Modern West" are stuck, trapped if you will, in 17th Century thought patterns.    On page 65, I am sure that it is not the author's intent (or at least I pray it is not his intent) to imply that Jesus' rebuke of Peter with "Get behind me, Satan" is due to Peter having revealed Jesus' "secret identity" as the Christ.  Another troubling point arises on page 66 in his discussion of the Holy Spirit and the work of the Holy Spirit where McLaren states that "This kingdom [the Kingdom of God] represents a counterforce, a countermovement, a counterkingdom..."  Stop there for a moment; did McLaren just say that God and the Evil One balance one another? They cancel each other out?  Is this the Star Wars version of God's truth?  He is pretty repetitive in his writing...he does say that God's Kingdom has an evil counterpart.  He also refers to the Holy Spirit as a "new force."    McLaren frequently draws on material from Dallas Willard and other modern mystics. While there is beauty and mystery in the Christian faith, modern mystics such as Willard, are reintroducing (or perhaps just repopularizing) gnosticm into our churches.    Every once in a while a moment of clarity, a moment of truth, actually rings forth and one such nugget is found on page 84 with his discussion of what kind of a job the "shepherds" or pastors have done: "We may have instructed them [the people in their care] how to be a good Baptist, Presbyterian, Catholic, or Methodist on Sunday, but we didn't train, challenge, and inspire them to live out the Kingdom of God in their jobs, neighborhoods, families, schools, societies between Sundays."  That is a true statement in a lot of our churches, however, it is not the case in ALL churches.  Part of the problem, in my humble opinion, is a lack of focus and emphasis on sound teaching, verse-by-verse, from the pulpits.   McLaren does attempt to lay out some practical advice as to how one might go about putting their faith into Action on pages 86-87.  I am drawn to the story he shares also about Carter, the taxi driver in DC on page 89.    Another moment of clarity comes on page 109, where McLaren writes:  "If you say you believe his [Jesus] message, but you don't seek to practice ir, your faith is a matter of words only; it's not substantial, not real. Faith that counts then, is not the absence of doubt; it's the presence of action."  
 I have to say that I was disappointed when I opened up the package containing my iPod wallet. It's cute, but not $60ish cute. First of all, it's not leather, it's nylon. The lining is indeed suede, but the photos in the product listing are misleading. I'm keeping it because the hassle of shipping it back, etc. isn't worth it. It does the job, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I feel ripped off 
 This book was too basic, and it hopped around too much.  I am still looking for a good "how to" book on using these calculators.  I guess I would have preferred a workbook of problems.  Perhaps a workbook would help me harness the full power of a financial calculator 
 My son's are 9 and 12 yrs old. This game couldn't hold their attention, nor mine. It's incredibly boring, slow and unimaginitive. Small pieces got lost and mangled. When we moved, I threw this game in the trash! Please don't buy this item. There are so many other choices for family fun time 
 The book is readable.  The pacing is pretty good.  Some of the scenes are pretty good.  The basic plot:  Dr. Victor Frank is a fertility and genetics genius and leads a world-class fertility and research company.  He and his wife decide to use in vitro fertilization to have a second child.  Dr. Frank is unable to restrain himself from tinkering with the embryo's genetic makeup and developmental schedule.  His secret experimentation results in a super-intelligent son, VJ.  Unfortunately, VJ's super intelligence comes with a complete amorality and pandemonium ensues.  Heavy-handed allusions, too-obvious foreshadowing, and a conclusion that is projected from chapter one are all problems.  There are plot holes you could drive a truck through.  Characterization is extremely simple, character development is non-existent, and the plot twists are too simple and obvious to be very enjoyable.  The basic premise of a super-intelligent amoral murdering drug-lord is not that original.  Now make him three years old when he kicks off his murdering spree by offing his own brother and, well, let's just say that it's not particularly credible.  By the time he's five he's bio-engineering lethal and infectious cancers in a genetics lab he assembled from stolen equipment?  I'm just not buying it.  Although the science and medicine are explained pretty well, they're just not used in a credible way.  Final analysis:  There are many better things to read 
 I personally hate it when songs are printed in different keys from the original recording, or they are printed in an abridged form. This is the case with this volume from the under appreciated Sondheim show "anyone  can whistle". Not only are the above mentioned problems present, but  one of the best songs (See what it gets you) is given a slow blues tempo  that just doesn't compare to the manic tone of the original. Granted, the  shows most famous song (there won't be trumpets) is included, but again, it  is in the wrong key and some of the lyrics are wrong. The mayoress' (played  by Angela Lansbury and Madeline Kahn) song "Iv'e got you to lean  on" (another toe tapper) is also presented abridged and in the wrong  key. Abd the lovely duet "with so little to be sure of" is  presented here as a solo, with the wonderful counterpoint female part  ommitted.  it is a shame that this show wasn't given a better treatmen 
 This movie is not very realistic.  The sets are great!, but the story is a Biblical SNAFU!  They had the chance to embellish the real story, without compromizing the Bible's account, but chose instead to incorporate incidents that were thousands of years later, which impeached any incredibility it might have had. I didn't like it much for that reason.  
 The quality of all the movies is poor-comparable to or worst than VCD. I watched the first 2 dices and lost interest in the rest of the movies. It is more worthy to buy 1 good DVD movie than 50 lousy poor quality classic.  
 This book seems to me to be another hoax of the type which appeared during the years following WWII.  The "diary" is written like a novel, with plenty of dialogue. The book focuses on rape and seems to have been written to appeal to prurient curiosity.  It just doesn't ring true.  For example, near the end, the author writes that she gave her diaries to her former sweetheart to read.  "'What's this supposed to mean?' he asked, pointing to 'Schdg.'  I had to laugh:  'Schandung,'--of course--rape."  Oh yes, Ha Ha, very funny.  I'm sure the mass rapes of the German women after the fall of Berlin were just a hoot, especially to those who experienced it.  No wonder the book met with hostility and criticism when it was first published in 1954--the book definitely demeans the horror of the experience the Berlin women survived.    The true identity of the author--"Anonymous"--has never been known.  Doubts over the authenticity of this "diary" have dogged the book since it was first published.  In the Introduction, it states that "...experts on personal documents from the period have confirmed that the diary's transcript is original and completely genuine."  Now that's hilarious!  Just how did they confirm that--carbon dating???  I'm just glad I didn't buy the book. I borrowed it from the Library yesterday and I can return it there today.  I wouldn't want to put money in the pockets of anyone associated with profiting in this disrespectful way off of the true-life tragedies of victims of WWII 
 This book is very out dated!! It is a history of the V6 engine up to the early 80's. Look for a more up to date book 
 R. Stockwell was right on in his review. Bryson comes off as a spoiled hypocrite in this book, constantly sprinkling on virtually every other page his disdain for anyone not as educated as himself. His favorite targets are Southern whites. A typical description is " ...loony hillbillies destabilized by gross quantities of impure corn liquor and generations of profoundly unbiblical sex." !!! How would a reviewer (of the NYT, for example) respond to a travelogue of our inner cities by some ruralista who describes inner-city youths as "... crazed blacks destabilized by gross quantities of crack and generations profoundly obsessed with having sex with a white woman."  --- Neither of these passages are acceptable but Bryson belongs to that ilk who's motto is: "Bigotry for me but not for thee." BYTW, his earlier book, "Lost Continent" is even more egregious with his kind of self-righteousness.  It's a shame he tarnishes himself and his writing with this kind of stuff.    
 I bought the book after seening an interview with the author on TV. Although the title is attractive to people in business but the book was very poorly written. I felt that he did not have much to say and the book has no real useful value. I guess he could have put everything he wanted to say in 15 or 20 pages only 
 Call me a Jane Austen Purist but i hated this movie, I did. I tried to bring myself to like it, but I feel as if the A&E version was more closer to the time, the era, the clothing, the language, the seting, etc. And then the constant childish giggling, this is not the Lizzie I know. The more I watched of the film the more I saw characters being destroyed. For example, Mr. Bennett was just not believable to me and Mr. Colins was poorly cast. I just didn't like this film, even I did think that Mcfayden did a good job in presenting darcy but I don't know, this film just did not do it for me. I feel as if Jane AUsten would be rolling in her grave if she saw this version. I do. I dont know how else to describe my disapointment..... 
 Hoffman's recipes sound delicious, but in fact are often flavorless. If you use her recipes, you WILL learn slow cooking tecniques (stacking meat in the pot, thickening sauces, etc). But after 7 years of using this book, my notes on the recipes have a continual refrain: "Needs more pizzaz"; "Add vegetables"; "Flavors need more depth". 
 Don't take the star rating wrong - this is as good as any of the other books in this series, but this edition (Quiet Vision Publishing - paperback, printed in 2000) is the cheapest printing of a book I've ever seen. Only about 20 pages into it, pages started falling out of the back. The type is huge and goes all the way to the edge of the page so your thumbs are constantly in the way while you're trying to read, and there are typographical errors like using two hyphens instead of em dashes. I know they make an electronic version of this book. As part of my job I convert a lot of print-intended content to digital publishing formats, and that's what usually happens to em dashes during that process, so I almost wonder if they just printed out their digital version and bound it. It looks like it was printed on a laser printer (especially the terrible cover illustration which looks like it was drawn by a 12-year old), and the fonts look like they're just PC-standard 'Times'. There are also several footnotes, which in the original edition that I read years ago were placed at the bottom of the page they were referenced from. In this edition they're in the back of the book 
 Isn't it funny that those posting negative reviews here write better, and seem better informed, than those posting positive reviews?  That alone speaks volumes as to whom this book appeals 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 This is the worst, most depressing piece of fiction I have ever read.  There is no real protoganist and not one singular character worthy of admiration--and after a while, their actions just become inexplicable.  The author's soul must truly be an ugly one to have devoted so much time and energy to using his mind to generate so many casual acts of evil throughout the book.  It starts out promising but by the time you get to about halfway through the book or so you get a nagging sense that your very own soul might be sucked out of you and permanently stolen by the heart of Neil Gaiman's darkness or one of his minions.  Additionally, the characters' motivations change like the shifting sands, nothing they do makes any real sense except some inexplicable movement towards doing greater and more evil en masse like some sort of coagulating bacteria or disease.  What is so creepy about this book is the casualness of it all.  Unlike some of Stephen King's work (ie: The Stand), there is absolutely no redeeming thread here--no rallying or marshalling the troops to combat the emerging evil.  It's evil in evil vs. evil surrounded by evil.  All I can say is that this book is ugly, ugly, ugly.  At least writers like Joyce Carol Oats and Joseph Conrad's intentions when writing about such things is to effectively demonstrate the ill effects of such darkness, but to make heroes of characters one should avoid is unconscionable.  The choices the supposed protoganist makes make no sense--and you do root for  him in the very beginning but you find he is just like one of them after all.  I suspended my doubt and disbelief as long as I could but finally became so incensed by the audacity of both the literary critics and the author to pass this off as excellence, I literally stopped mid-sentence and chose to never read this author's work again.  It's a shame too because he has allied himself in other incarnations with a truly gifted artist, Dave McKean, who maybe hasn't completely gone over to the dark side like Neil has.  His association with Dave McKean is the only reason I even opened-up the book--and maybe a little because the title intrigued me.  But it's unfortunate that the industry rewards "clever" works such as Mr. Gaiman's with undue praise.  I've never so strongly disliked a book.  Have you ever found yourself getting angry because you felt robbed or duped by a book?  Well, don't believe the hype, this is the one to throw in the trash or disintegrate with X-men eyeball laserbeams before all your humanity is sucked out of you 
 Taylor Hicks:  Perseverance - Yes.  Hard work - Maybe. Musical talent -  ABSOLUTELY NOT.  It's funny how people perceive music.  It's even funnier to see how people cast their votes in a talent contest as if they were voting for a political candidate or something. Hicks might represent all those virtues flag wavers love to preach about.  But that says NOTHING about his abilities as a musical performer.  I guess if you don't have an ear for music, you need something else to go on.  As far as this CD goes, I'll just say it's no better or no worst than all the other contrived American Idol productions.  It's kinda like another great American tradition: the McDonald's cheese burger - just another "run of the grill" 
 Well,this dvd was ok...tghey could of used better camras for the night scenes this dvd did have the punch of the 360 videos or any othere street racing movie..i think i could of made one better this dvd seems like they did it with a computer but did know wat they where doing...So i gave it 2 stars for lack of punch i prefer 360 VIDEOS LIKE TIMELAPSE HARD DRIVE AND OTHER VIDEOS LIKE ON THE SCEEN 1,2 AND STREET FURY SO DONT BUY THIS VIDEO IF U WAN TTO GO AHEAD BUT THE DISC SCRACTHED EASY OLNY HAD IT FOR A DAY AND THE DISC DIDNT WORK! 
 In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.  In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.  "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.  Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.  Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.  This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.   But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:  1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.  2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.  3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.  4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.  This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:  "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32)  "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91)  "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97)  "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110)  "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123)  In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.

Just for the record, here is a list of the places covered: Norway (Hammerfest, Oslo), France (Paris), Belgium (Brussels, Bruges, Spa, Durbuy), Germany (Aachen, Cologne, Hamburg), Holland (Amsterdam), Denmark (Copenhagen), Sweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm), Italy (Rome, Naples, Sorrento, Capri, Florence, Milan, Como), Switzerland (Brig, Geneva, Bern), Liechtenstein, Austria (Innsbruck, Salzburg, Vienna), Yugoslavia (Split, Sarajevo, Belgrade), Bulgaria (Sofia), Turkey (Istanbul) 
 Boring and like most every other new horror movie. Lame mask,I think the awful movie Cut used this mask also,who cares I suppose. This goes with all the other pathetic new era horror movies(Scream,I Know What You Did,Valentine,Urban Legend,Cut etc..) so bottom line don't waste your time,stick with 80's Slashers 
 Very poorly organized and researched. Subject matter was presented disjointed and incomplete. Too many passages were simply exerpted from other sources and pasted in wherever the author felt like it, and jumped about with no logical flow. I feel Daniel Poole's book What Jane Austin ate and Charles Dickens Knew was a much superior work. In fact I bought this book hoping to supplement what I had read in Daniel Pool's book, but it gave me no new insights 
 before i began writing this review, i surfed the internet looking for reviews from other readers.  90% of the reviews i read began or ended similarly: i am a ____teen year old girl.  having only gotten through 150 pages of this book before calling it quits, i wasn't surprised to learn that so many young women gravitated towards this book. after all, the novel's protagonist is just such a teenage girl.  however, this fact is more than a little bit troubling because astrid is not someone you'd want your daughter/sister/niece/cousin/etc to identify with. it's also troubling because when so many people, both younger and older, hail 'white oleander' as some sort of literary masterpiece, even going so far as to compare it to nabakov's 'lolita.' this is a horrifying book, not necessarily for the story's content (which is equally horrifying), but for it's plot, execution, characterization, and particularly its ham-fisted writing.  to be sure, this is a book written for the oprah generation and reflects the 'oprah-fication' of literature. the novel's problems are so many, that i simply won't have time to address them all.  however, i will address some of them:   1) astrid.  the novel's protagonist, a fourteen year old girl, is a thoroughly contradictory character.  some people have written that astrid is not your 'average' teenage girl and that she is 'gifted.'  if she were such a girl, i would expect much more of her.  that's the least of the problems, however.  i'm not a psychologist nor have i ever been shot, but i suspect any fourteen year old girl who's mother was sent to prison for murder, offered herself sexually to a man three times her age, is shot by her first foster mother, performs oral sex on a boy in exchange for 1/2 bag of marijuana would be severly emotionally disturbed and troubled.  astrid, however, seems to care less that she herself was nearly murdered, instead she focuses on and longs her sexual encounters with ray. remember, this is a fourteen year old girl.  any credibility astrid has a narrator is blown early on because no one who's gone through her experiences would be in as good as shape as she is. it also discredits her as a character, and with a discredited character, the novel doesn't stand a chance. think about a fourteen year old girl you know. now imagine her beaten, shot, mother in prison for murder, sexually loose (some may argue ray took advantage of her, but remember, astrid was the one who approached ray and when he said no, astrid was the one who dropped her clothes), and yearning for a lover three times her age. it simply wouldn't happen.    2) unfortunately, the plot fitch drops astrid is pretty much by the numbers.  i have trouble with any novel where the plot is advanced by a series of tragedies or dire circumstances.  more often than not, it's a gimmick (or crutch) inexperienced writers rely on when realistic ideas for authentic plots run thin ('the kite runner' suffered similar fate).  read joan didion or toni morrison (or steinbeck) and how see how they use tragedy--it's real, honest, and most importanly believable.  most of the 'white oleander's' is simply too unrealistic.  3)  the prose is borderline comical.  i was awe-struck to read how many people have praised fitch's prose.  fitch's use of similie is so overdone and forced that it slows the narrative down to a cumbersome pace.  similes should be used judiciously and flow naturally. fitch, on the other hand, find it's necessary to inject as many as four or five similies in just about every paragraph, and most of them just ring false and forced.  the 'white' metaphor is also an unfortunate victim.  count the number of times fitch uses 'white' to describe astrid, ingrid, clothes, food, dishes, the sky, etc, etc, etc.  she beats the 'white' metaphor into holy submission and never really allows the reader to discover for him or herself underlying metaphors.  the majority of the book is over-described, and so many of the descriptions are flowery and self-indulgent, as if fitch is trying to prove to her readers that she's a capable and talented writer.  the sex scenes, in particular, are dreadful.  i don't want to read how a fourteen year old remembers every graphic detail of performing oral sex on a middle-aged man.  it's too much. way too much.  a 14 year old girl who's performed oral sex on a man is not going to long for it again. i can tell you that.  furthermore: at one point astrid sees a shiny convertible, compares it to a man,  and imagines herself climaxing while laying on its hood; during her encounter with ray, she describes the act as riding a horse through the surf.  and those are just the sex scenes.  also, fitch refers to one man's hair as 'balding.'  hair, of course, can't bald.  scalps can bald.  hair cannot bald.  these comparisons seem better fit for 3.99 romance novels at the supermarket checkout.  fitch also seems intent on stringing together a bunch of pretty words in hopes of making pretty sentences.  unfortunately, this does not work.  pretty words don't necessarily make pretty sentences the same way pretty notes don't necessarily make pretty songs.  fitch's prose works much the same way thomas kincaide's 'art' works -- it's looks pretty, but there's really no substance to it.  it's also much like 'legends of the fall' -- sure it looks great, but all you get when you strip the prettiness away, you end up with little more than a soap opera.  she would do well to focus more on advancing plot than affecting a poetic or lyrical voice.  4) the characters and uniformly cliched and poorly drawn.  astrid's mother is the self-absorbed, feminist poet.  her first foster mother is a bible-thumping floozy; her stepmother's boyfriend is the object of astrid's desires, even though he's more then three times her age; the second stepmother is demanding and her husband is quiet and reserved; and of course we have the 'hooker with a heart of gold' who takes astrid under her wing.   in fact, the professional prostitute is the only emotionally stable and 'nice' character in the entire 150 pages that i read.   what's fitch trying to say?  maybe something, maybe nothing.  but fitch's character's seem born straight out of some pseudo-intellectual writer's workshop.  any editor worth his or her salt should've have caught and corrected these flaws.  the fact that the editor(s) didn't, while i'd like to think it was out of sheer laziness, is  proof that american literature as a whole is in serious decline and that unrealistic plots and characters = big dollars.  and as i mentioned earlier, the fact that so many people hail this book as high literature signals trouble for the future of the american letters.  i know most people will probably vote this 'unhelpful' simply because i disagree on the book's merits.  that's fine. i, for one, strongly object to this novel on the whole.  i'm sure that as most of the teenage girls grow up and mature, they'll see 'white oleander' for what is is: an immature, adolescent novel masquerading as high literature. and i sincerely hope that no more young women identify with astrid in anyway.  that's the real tragedy 
 This pad is shown with the All Terrain Cargo Wagon as "Better Together" but it does not fit!  
 This just might be the worst technical book I own.  There is some useful material in it, but it is so poorly written that t's hard to tell.  There are non-sentences, some sentences that are impossible to understand even after re-reading, non-sequitirs, and more typos than I have seen in any other book.  The text repeatedly says things like, "At present (as of this writing)", without telling you when that is -- and the data given will be at odds with data just a few pages away, which begins with the same disclaimer.  The text is also highly repetitive -- how many times do I have to be told that cHTML is just like HTML?  The material on WAP is internally inconsistent, and, from what I can tell, outright wrong in places.  Many of the pictures appear to be low-resolution images....  I feel the publisher should have had someone redraw pie charts so that the fonts are legible. ...  There must be a better one on the topic.  
 The music video clips on this dvd were without sound. It showed no full length videos and had stupid commentary. Unless I got a bad dvd this was a crappy buy 
 This was given to us as a gift. We returned it the next day. Although it made nice waffles, it had three major faults which are the reasons we returned it.  1) The handle is part plastic and part metal. The metal portions become extremely hot when the appliance is on.   2) The latch on the lid was very difficult to release once the waffles were cooked. However, on one occasion, during the middle of cooking, the lid blew open with explosive force and could have caused serious injury if anyone had been standing over it.  3) The batter really does go everywhere on this machine. It leaked all over the sides and the switch, making it a pain to clean.   There are better, safer, machines on the market 
 This book should be approached with caution.  If you can get past the "flaunt" of Dr. Pepe's fabulous life and the fact that she would dare to show off how much better she is doing in front of other MS sufferers, some that are in wheelchairs and probably wish they too could twirl on their high heels, then perhaps you should remember that this is one woman's opinion.  Her advice will not cure you.  It is unbelievable that someone would tout the old wives' tales (bee vemon and dental fillings) as part of a path to successfully overcoming the symptoms of MS.  If there were any significance to either of these woudn't we know it?  After all, people have been trying them for decades now.  The use of CAM (complimentary and alternative) therapies can be beneficial.  A very good neurologist advised me that a combination of proper exercise, yoga, good nutrition, a daily multi-vitamin and trying to remain generally positive was best.  I have to say he was right.  After six years of constant MS problems and attacks, I adopted a healthier lifestyle, including regular exercise, and have been relapse free for almost four years.  (If you are wondering, I do take one of the ABCR drugs as well.)  A better alternative to buying this book would be to get Nancy Davis' book.  It is titled, "Lean on Me: Ten powerful steps to taking back your life after your diagnosis".  It is more realistic and more helful to the average person that this book.  
 This book is written from the viewpoint of a flaming socialist with the attitude that anything white or European or is overly valued in American history textbooks.  Loewen does have many valid points about what history textbooks omit, but the degree to which he is clearly slanted to the left is ludicrous.  "Lies My Teacher Told Me" could have been an amazing book, but all it did was aggrivate me and motivate me to write a 23 page paper debunking half of what the author wrote, much to the dismay of my idiotic Sociology professor.  The only reason I didn't give the book 1 star is because the overall intent and effort put forth were good, but the book as a whole is just far too biased 
 By far one of the worse albums 2 come out the south since,  well since I can remember, GARBAGE,  on the highest level, I actually took the CD back to Best Buy, walked up to customer service and told them they can have it back and keep the money. If u are trying to be Rich, U need to come up with a better game plan cause u sure didnt put effort in this peice of work. U want to be a Rich Boy, I want to be a Rich MAN, Now how Rich is that 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 Another disposable product by Shark. Gets clogged easily and the bottom breaks off easily - Don't believe what they say about lifting 150 lbs- that's not true unless you can use it on the moon! In my oppinion, This vacuum is not much better than a cheap stick vac except it doesn't last as long 
 Some entertainers can cross into other professions.  T.O. needs to play football and only football.  He is not an author.  This is poorly written, it is whiney, it is as if he is a school boy with tons of drama.  He needs medication.  One of teh greatest football players in the league and he has to try this 
 I bought this book nearly as soon as it came out, and I absolutely loved it.  The cartoons and the layout of the book are superb. I did not really use the CD's, however, because I was in transition between computers.  It was still nice knowing that there were 60,000 more cartoons waiting for me if ever I wanted to read them, and with the stellar quality of the book, I assumed the same for the CD's.    I was wrong.  The cartoons on the CD's are very low resoluton- this means that the pictures are not clear; they look a little blocky and pixelated.  Also, the large, multi-panel cartoons have been compressed even more so as to fit on to one page.  I was severely disappointed. The captions, however, are very nice.  Too bad it's often difficult to see what they're referring to. I don't really have the complete cartoons of the New Yorker: I've got about half, with the other half illegibly thrown into the mix.    Why then two stars?  It's simple: The book itself is very nice.  With the price lower now, It is a very reasonable price for the Best Cartoons of the New Yorker, which is what this book is without the CD's.  The book is wonderful, just don't be confused into thinking that you will be able to read every cartoon as the book claims 
 This puzzle was a disappointment.  The pieces are poorly made and don't stay connected.  I thought the picture would be the same on the tin and have the circus animals.  On the upside, the tin is very nice and my son loves to use it to carry his trains around.  The Giant Thomas floor puzzle (24 pieces) was much better 
 i find this book boring   full of theories instead of giving examples. 
 I read this book with anticipation since I lost my mother to suicide.  Nevertheless, the book seems to be written only as a conduit to Suicide Survivor Support Groups; other grief materials are far more effective and ultimately superior 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I was very disappointed in this book and judging from the steady decline of the resale price here on amazon.com, I can see others agree.  First of all the book looks like it was photocopied in someone's basement - the text is completely faded out and paper feels terrible. For almost $100, I expect a little more.  The actual contents of the book are not much better. I found Royden (the required text for our class) to be very sparse and was hoping for something to fill in the details. This book did little to help. It covers integration in a rather idiosyncratic way, devotes little time to differentiation, and says nothing about convexity.   If you are looking for a good anaysis book I recommend either "Lebesgue Integration on Euclidean Space" by Frank Jones or the slightly more abstract "Real and Functional Analysis" by Serge Lang 
 I agree w/ T. Morrey's review "Worst publishing I have ever seen, February 7, 2005".  I haven't even read the book yet, so this isn't a review of the content but rather the quality of the "publication" itself.  The book I received -- and paid $20 for -- appears to be a crude copy of an original publication, so far as I can tell.  I very much doubt that the copy I received is true a HarperCollins publication.  Looks more like a photocopy.  I'll be trying to get my money back for this one 
 Two of us read this book and we were both disappointed.  Characters are depressing and annoying.  The storyline is predictable.  We both loved John's two last books but fiction is not his forte.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 One of the most frustrating things about buying and reading parenting or pregnancy books has been the proseltizing, condescening, and dogmatic views so many authors take.  Parenting books would have you believe any other parenting method than their own is tantamount to child abuse.  Pregnancy books would have you believe drinking a Coke or dying your hair should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This book is the same - OB/GYNs are money grubbers who compromise what is best for mothers and babies, while midwives are all-knowing, altruistic souls who always do the right thing. The author makes no bones about it in the introduction. The author does quote studies, but uses studies showing negative benefit of some action or treatment to argue that the opposite must be superior - lack of data be damned.  If you want a "thinking" guide, look elsewhere.  If you need reassurance that "natural" childbirth is gonna make you and your baby superior to everyone else, go nuts with this one.  
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 After reading this book, I wished to hang myself with a thousand ribbons. It is a fictional work of junk and a waste of my time. Phillis constantly complains about everything going on in her life, even though most of it never happened. It was boring, useless, untrue, poinless, petty, junk, and all around horrible. It made me miserable and I chose to burn it when I was done. If I wasn't forced to read it, I would've never wasted my money reading this junk. I searched for the audiobook to numb the pain but to no avail, I was stuck reading the whole thing. I pity anyone else who must read this garbage. I suggest you take the money you were going to spend on this and burn it, it will save you time, effort, and will be much more rewarding. Sorry to all who read this book 
 I had bought this book because it was "Required Reading" for one of my classes in art college. Not worth buying. Each page features storyboards of various motion graphics commercials/video art (and not even the best motion graphics at that). If I could return it, I'd return it right away. If you're an art student and you're a motion graphics art student, and you're required to buy this book for class, please don't waste your money. You are better off reviewing reels of commercials on company websites and learning from them. The choices of work in this particular book are terrible. The art/color is very mediocre and most seemed to have been released in the 1990's. Much of commercials/motion graphics nowadays are very sophisticated and artsy. You'd learn a lot more by watching the commercials on t.v.    If you are a student, please save your money for your bus fare/train commuting, or better yet save it as lunch money 
 Sean sings like Yoko.  To quote another reviewer, "Leave the music to Julian,"  PLEASE!  Does any more need to be said 
   This is a book meant to be enjoyed by children under the age of 10.  Young teens and adult readers will be disapointed. Wish I never wasted the time of day reading it. Glad it was borrowed from the library and not purchased or I'd demand my money back 
 Founding concepts are really dated now as Bruner himself seays in the latest preface.  Useful for historic reasons but not for today's teaching needs. Amazon did an excellent job of delivery etc.  Should probably not recommend it to those who buy Wong for exampl 
 If you love Dick Cheney you will love this book. For the rest of us, this is nothing more than a partisan pamphlet designed to amuse a small group of non-thinking true believers. Wait until it's remaindered for 99 cents to buy it for good sitting-on-the-john reading. I'll leave it to your imagination what you can do with it after you're done 
 This is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness Lewis' early literary attempts.  Although Lewis is a witty, scrutinizing, insightful, and overall entertaining writer, I think this book is highly overpriced. Most of the topics in this book cover financial/business culture issues that date back during the late eighties, so there's also a bit of historical perspective to it, when LBOs were a la mode, Donald Trump was making headlines, and Japan was considered a threat to the US economy and welfare...crazy thought.  Go for Liar's Poker if you want to read Michael Lewis, that script is a jewel 
 I bet if the people who rated this book highly were polled as to what year they utilized its guidance there would be a direct correlation to how close they were to the release of this only edition...hint hint Lonely Planet editors...UPDATE THIS BOOK!   I don't know where to begin but who in the world rides loops when they are bicycle touring.  While I admit that the Southern Alps loop was pretty cool I couldn't overlook the out of date information and sometimes inaccurate terrain profiles in this book.  I quicky learned not to rely too heavily on this book and transitioned over to the, much lighter, Pedaller's Paradise.  That wafer thin book of goodness in conjunction with the NZ AA maps (which are free to anyone who has an Autoclub memmbership) were much more informative and enjoyable.  I am not sure if Amazon carries that book but you can easily search for "pedaller's paradise."    Lastly, I took a Lonely Planet New Zealand guide book as well and found that not worth its brick-like weight in my pannier.  I found the New Zealand Tourist Information centers and the people who staff them much more informative and much more fun to engage.   The first thing I usually did when rolling into towns was to b-line directly for the Tourist Information.  One more thing...if you like to mountain bike as well pick up the Kennett Brother's book, Classic New Zealand Mountain Bike Rides,  by searching for "kennett bros classic. 
 This book was a real disappointment: each listing has from 0 to 10 words about each establishment, and then LENGTHY driving directions. I can read a map - I'd rather have some detail about the restaurants / cafes / stores. As much info as in this book I could get from a phone book and save the cost of the book 
 I'm giving this movie two stars because of the supporting actors, and, the book from which the movie is taken.  I believe those are what the rest of the reviews are truely applauding without realizing it.  Tom Hanks is a wonderful actor, and, seems like a nice guy, but, he needs to figure out what movies he is 'right' for, and, which ones he should turn down.    Tom, Tom .... that accent...ouch!  Sounds like you NEVER tried actually talking to someone from Alabama.  If you really did...well, honeychil', accents just aren't your thing - don't do no more of 'em!  They should have asked an English actor - they do spot on southern accents.  Maybe, it's time for a re-make with Jude Law.  Forrest was not a handsome man in the book, but, apparently, that doesn't transfer to the screen, so, get a hottie who can do an accent.  Tom's just makes my ears ache! 
 This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
 Jim Hightower needs to quit stabbing people in the back. That is not how you solve America's problems. Another piece of pure fiction from a Michael Moore wannabee.  
 Reasonably interesting book but not if one is specifically interested in the periodic table or its evolution.  Only one or two chapters are actually on the periodic table.  In addition the final 40 or so pages consist just of a "catalog of elements", essentially a complete list of all the elements, the dates they were discovered etc.  This is nothing more than a page filler for a book that is well written but rather too superficial for anybody really interested in chemistry and physics 
 I was really looking forward to this book, because I believe each World Series, especially in the deadball era should be recorded for history with a scholarly account.  Unfortunately the 1906 White Sox- Cubs series still awaits that account.  Potential readers expecting a book of the same standard as Louis P. Masur's Autumn Glory or Roger I. Abrams The First World Series, both about the 1903 World Series will be sorely disappointed by this effort.  I got the impression that parts of the book were rushed out after the White Sox won the 2005 series and were not written by Bernard Weisberger, but by a TV script writer. I find it hard to believe that a "distinguished teacher and author of American History" and "one of the best historians on earth" could write in the following style.  "It was a great double play of the balletlike kind that makes baseball glow, and like Evers great pickup in the first, it stopped the hemorrhaging. But four more runs were in for Jones's pyrotechnic experts."  "He attended Georgetown University, and in 1902 earned his dental degree (the course for which was then shorter)."   Four years, two years, ten years, we are not told. One minute we are being given lengthy essays on Spalding, Comiskey and the labor wars, and then we are given very clipped one sentence career information about the actual players, who participated in the series.   Also some of the content and comment was just annoyingly wrong and clearly not checked by a competent editor.  For instance, "....-but the Irish and the Germans had begun to make their inroads."  This is 1906 we are discussing, and perhaps the author had never heard of Jennings, Keeler, Kelley and McGraw, those "hardscrabble Irish" heroes of the Baltimore Orioles. But surely as the players in the series included, Hofman, Sheckard, Moran, Schulte, Steinfeldt, Kling, Reulbach, Pfeister, Hahn, Rohe, Donahue, Dougherty, Sullivan, Altrock and Walsh, I think we can safely say that the Germans and Irish had more than "begun to make their inroads".  I don't like being so harsh, but when a book is only 184 pages long I want it to spend the pages on the subject or closely related themes, not lengthy diversions on baseball's labor wars, and the 2005 White Sox victory.  One particularly annoying feature was that in the first paragraph of chapter 5 Bernard Weisberger lenghtily explains that the third and fourth games of a best of seven series tied at one all are the "swing games", as if we are unable to count to three or four. Fielders are "like a hawk hovering over a field mouse", or run down fly balls "like a cheetah." If these embellishments were intended to replicate the style of 1906 newspaper reporting they were a singular failure.   This could have been such a good book if it had concentrated more on the series, the players, the season, and the city of Chicago as it was in 1906. If you are billed as "one of the best historians on earth" with "enormous talents" your books have to meet a very high standard, and unfortunately I don't think this book reached those standards 
 I gather Mr Seagrave is a journalist, and not a trained historian. His sloppiness shows on the cover (She was not China's last Empress) and in the author's note which claims China had three 'reigning empresses'. This last shows clearly that Mr Seagrave doesn't understand the subject. It's difficult to know what exactly he means by the term. Ci Xi was an Empress who had an remarkable degree of influence. Other Empresses had varying degrees of influence. Ci Xi was not a 'reigning empress' if that means she was formally the monarch. Only one woman, Wu Zetian, ever held that position, and she should rightly be called Emperor, not Empress, as there was no concept of 'Empress' in imperial China other than as the consort of an Emperor. Writing a special note in the front of the book to lump these three together and imply that they all held the same position, presumably in order to emphasise the remarkable power that Ci Xi held, irreparably undermines Mr Seagrave's credibility. 
 I remember when this ran on ESPN2 during the week between Christmas & New Year's back in 2000. I'm a huge fan of the microgenre of football movies...but this one stays at the bottom of the barrel.   Pettine Sr. seems like a class act & worthy of the respect "local legend" high school football coaches deserve. His son, Pettine Jr, coaches at the rival school but lacks the charisma to make this documentary work.  Maybe the footage of him not seeming like a dolt didn't record right & thus we have no reason to root for him or his program at the finale. Rather than having a bittersweet moment at the ending after the dad plays the head-to-head season finale against the son, Pettine Jr seems kinda clueless giving the old guy a half-hearted handshake.  So much for paternal respect & love.  Had the potential to be great w/the setup. But don't let the glowing summary trick you...there's no emotional payoff to speak of for "The Last Game."  Football, after all, has driven grown men to tears on numerous occassions. Your time would be better spent watching Brian's Song, Rudy or the NBC series "Friday Night Lights." Even reruns of MTV's "Two-a-days" about Hoover of Alabama would be superior if you prefer the doc/reality TV style 
 This movie is so bad, Kids should not see it. It's like a kidergarden student wrote this movie! You know what they shouldve put in? How about characters not liscenced, bad guys, talking animals, and a better backstory. They shouldve called the movie "The Amazing Missing Dog Adventure", Which was probaly what they had in mind before they thought, "No wait! Make it about Arthur! We already ruiend Casper and Barbie, Now let's do the same thing with Arthur." And that's right, it's by Mainframe Entertainment 
 jihad only for in defese of islam not murders this book insults muslims as dogs we live and work to eat and happiness we are not animals and men who seek truth read koran not this book lies enslave the mind insults to islam not freedom of press but hat 
 The chapters in this book are transcripts of three academics rambling on and on as they speculate about "cosmic consciousness" and how it touches upon existence, science, history, religion, etc.    An example of their fare: "The chaos revolution now taking place throughout the sciences is a major setback for the forces of law and order, control and dominance.  Scientists, the high priests of Marduk, must now accept chaos and replace Tiamat on her rightful throne.  This is why I say that chaos is the biggest thing since the wheel.  Imagination, creativity and inspiration are all on the upswing.  Chaos, Gaia, Eros-arise!"  If you find meaning in statements like this, you will probably love this book.  This material reminds me of listening to late-night frat house bull sessions, or someone who's stoned and thinks that his random navel-gazing is actually providing profound insights.  It's reminiscient of the psychedelic froth of the 1960's.    I didn't find this worth the time spent reading it 
 these covers are pretty bad. some good ones have been done, cameron mcgill @ the uncommon ground tribute, big sir's everybody here wants you is good, but this is bad, no matter what entertainment weekly's review might say. avoid, buy a REAL jeff or tim album 
 Ok, I was hasty in this purchase.  At first glance it seemed a small price to pay for a camera case...about $14, shipping included.  Then I got the camera case and found the dimensions somewhat lacking in the space requirement for the camera I ordered.  You see, the dimensions listed under "more details" are for the outside of the case, not the inside (but it doesn't say interior nor exterior, just gives dimensions).  Turns out, not only do you have to click "more details," (fine print) you also have to click "more technical details." (finer print)  Wish I had now.  Just wasted $9 for shipping on a 6 oz camera case.  ElectroGalaxy will not refund shipping charges, and they charge a %20 restocking fee.  So, at most, after I pay return shipping, (the case is only $4) I might get back $2.  So, yeah I was hasty, but I was also robbed 
 This is a none-scientific book. It is based on basic common sense ideas. Eat less and excercise. Dah! We already knew that 
 I didn't enjoy the film.  I also didn't enjoy the original play by Shakespeare.  King Lear is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays.  I don't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add nothing of value to the original.  You can set it wherever you like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up three hours of your time.  A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son.  The youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father.  He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated shabbily.  He's wanted dead or dead.  In this treatment of the annoying plot, he loses his mind.  He has a faithful follower or two.  They overact.  There is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play.  Lear Hidetoro is an absolute jerk.  Am I supposed to care what happens to him?  Why?  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one?  You may as well cry over Saddam Hussein.  Look at this movie with fresh eyes.  Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes.  This stuff simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good.  The hell with King Lear.  He's an annoyance 
 I've occasionally enjoyed William F. Buckley's Blackford Oakes novels, but "Getting It Right" is by the far the worst novel he's written. While I commend Buckley for looking at two of the most extreme groups in American conservatism, his fictional treatment might have worked better as a memoir, since he himself was a pivotal player in many of the events shaping the course of the American conservative movement in the 1950's and 1960's. Instead he presents two one-dimensional protagonists who happen to fall in love, despite the fact that they are working for the political groups that are polar opposites of each other; the male protagonist for the John Birch Society, his female counterpart for Ayn Rand's Objectivist clique. Regrettably this novel was difficult to read through its entirety inspite of its relative brevity. I can only endorse it for those who are truly passionate about modern American conservatism and diehard fans of William Buckley's thoughts and prose 
 The Book of nine sword is 90% a book provide rules for 3 new classes. Most of  these rules arn't useable by other classes. For me a whole book for three new classes is over the top. In the PHB you get 11 classes plus the core rules in 300 pages. Nine swords gives you 3 in 150 pages, and most of what you get is compatiable with other classes. If you want 3 new classes, and a whole book of rules for them, its good.  But its not value for money 
 I believe what the author is saying, but found the book lacking in the detail and critical thinking needed to prove his conclusions. If you want the fluff, this book delivers. If you want an in-depth critical analysis of the science behind the cholesterol myth, save your money. This book is for the cheerleaders of the "chloesterol myth bandwagon."  It does not address the scientific issues sufficiently to support a change in current - and I believe wrong - "chloesterol-centric" thinking 
           The major prediction   made by Glassman and Hassett in this book,written in 1999,was that"A sensible target date for Dow 36,000 is early 2005,but it could be reached much earlier"(1999,p.140).This fantastic science fiction forecast,like the similar 1999 fiction forecasts of Abby Joseph Cohen, Elias(1999)and Kadlec(1999),was mathematically and economically impossible since the single best predictor of future stock market values is the rate of growth in gdp(gross domestic product).To obtain a Dow of 36,000 by 2005 at the latest would have required continuous quarterly gdp growth rates of 7%-8% from 1999 through 2005.Starting in late 1999(Sept.,1999) through March,2000,the 3 wisemen,Warren Buffett,George Soros,and Peter Lynch,liquidated all of the stocks in their portfolios and exited the market.They transferred their cash to other assets.Unfortunately,far too many financial investors failed to follow them out of all of the stock markets and ended up losing about 8 trillion dollars.The best long treatment of stock market behavior is the 3 rd edition of C.P.Kindleberger's Manias,Panics,and Crashes(1996).His major point was that you automatically have a bubble once you start hearing  claims that there is a new economy that represents a complete break with all past market fundamentals.This was precisely the claim made by Gilder,Laffer,Wanniski,Glassman and Hassett,Elias,Kadlec,etc. Paul Samuelson's 1996 prediction-"Sometime in the next five years you may kick yourself for not reading and re-reading Kindleberger's Manias,Panics,and Crashes"-hit the nail on the head.The best short treatment is still chapter 12 of John Maynard Keynes's 1936 The General Theory of Employment,Interest and Money 
 This can opener works perfectly but the two gripper and cutting spoked wheels rusted early on. This can opener got a top rating from a consumer products review show but I wish I owned a can opener that didn't rust 
 When REA (Research & Education Association) released its initial version of GRE LITERATURE IN ENGLISH in 1989, I bought it to prepare myself for that test.  I was not particularly impressed with the organization or the lack of suggestion as to how to best make use of the material presented. Still, authors Beard, Kennedy, Liftig, and Malek included six full length exams with explanations.  That was 230 x 6 or 1,380 test prep questions. I took the test and scored middlingly.  Years later, I learned to "psyche" out the test and was surprised to discover a new and supposedly updated version.  In this newer version, Malek cuts down the number of tests from 6 to 3. Nearly every one of the regurgitated questions is a reprint from nearly 15 years ago, thus ensuring that this text does not reflect any of the major changes in test content during that time. What Malek does try is to emulate the far more successful paradign put out by the Princeton Review's CRACKING THE GRE LITERATURE by codifying the vast array of western literature: genres, timelines, book and author lists, literary terms, schools of literary criticism, etc. The problem is that Malek did not do half as thorough a job as the Princeton Review did. Malek does little more than to use an overly broad brush to skim a distressingly long list of required readings without giving any hint as how to best do that. True, neither did the Princeton Review, but at least the latter presented a methodology that was reasonable. This is not to say that Malek's updated text is useless. Anything, no matter how scant, that prepares you for a mind-numbing test has its uses, but if you insist on using Malek, you might prefer to go to the library to find the 1989 version that gives more preparation than its more recent cousin.  By the way, Malek's test questions themselves: many of them are so outlandish that one is amazed that he thinks ETS will ask such trivia.   You have been warned. 
 I think it was written for people with a basic knowledge of football and not the non-fan. The terms in the glossary didn't  make sense to me at all. Decided to forget about finishing the book and just make appetizers instead for the actual fans. Sorry but it didn't inspire me to learn about the game at all 
 Another sax player who had as his sole influence guys like Kenny G.  This is just plain poor music by any standard.  There is no substance here 
 I was hoping to see some concert footage of early UFO but, didn't get to see a single song played in its entirety!  BS commentary, etc. fill most of this DVD.  SAVE YOUR MONEY 
 I own a few Indonesian cook books already, so I browsed the index of this one carefully before ordering it. The recipes looked pretty standard until I noticed an entry for compressed rice, or lontong. I love lontong and was excited to think I would learn the secret to making it myself.  When I got the book, the first thing I did was turn to page 114 to see how to press lontong. Instead, I found a superficial overview of popular tropical fruits. I turned the page and under the heading "Puddings and Cake" found a capsule summary of the Badui culture of Sunda. Then again, for a cookbook, it was actually a pretty long section considering it said nothing about Badui cuisine other than that it is fascinating to watch them boiling palm sugar to sell.  I scanned every page looking for lontong. It appears only in the index.  The photos are lively, well-composed, and apt, but the text reads like an outdated travel guide. If this author's next work is a coffee table book of photos, I will buy it--provided she gets a partner to write the captions.  
 Disclaimer:  I have only been able to sample Professor Butz's work.  I looked at those portions of particular interest to me.  I read what he had to say about Jewish demographics, that is, the number of Jews in Europe before and after the Second World War.  I also looked at what he had to say about the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, at which the Germans, according to the standard historians, decided on the Holocaust. I was also interested to see how he evaluated the Nuremberg trials of the top Nazi leaders.    On population figures, Professor Butz will not accept any data from Jewish or "Communist" (i.,e. Soviet) sources, since, he says, such sources are tainted.  Jews and Communist lie, according to Professor Butz, so why listen to them.  On the Wannsee Conference, he quotes the Nazi sources that speak of Nazi plans to deport all of Europe's Jews and to enslave them.  But since these Nazis did not spell out an intention to kill all Jews in so many words, Professor Butz finds that, therefore,  this source is reliable evidence for his proposition that no such killings took place.  In Professor Butz's book, moreover,  whoever says that he has witnessed the Holocaust is a liar.    On the Nuremberg trials, he finds that any incriminating statements by Nazis to have been extorted by cruel and sadistic Allied guards.  Professor Butz's work gives evidence of great industriousness.  He has many footnotes and supplies many figures and pictures.  Such apparatus has been taken as a sign of deep scholarship by his friends and supporters.  But his analysis of all these data is simple:  whatever supports his thesis is accepted, whatever contradicts it is called a lie.  But unfortunately for Professor Butz,  it is quite impossible to accept his thesis without also accepting his notion of the Jews.  He sees Jews of all stripes -- from the most Zionist to folks like Noam Chomsky -- as united in a vast conspiracy to dupe the non-Jewish world.  Moreover, in order to accept Professor Butz's work, we must also accept that this Jewish conspiracy, this "Hoax" as he calls it, was also uncritically accepted by all the professional historians who have worked in this area.  Everyone is a dupe, everyone, that is, except he himself and his handful of friends.    Is that plausible ?  I don't think so.  
 Hi! I'm a pseudo-intellectual and I dabble in obscure Eastern mysticism, therefore I am superior to you. Did I tell you about poignant passage where Az'herlhabeld casts a disenchantment spell on Saturn's rings? Oh that's right, you probably don't know who Az'herlhabeld is because you haven't read the beautifully mystifying KABBALAH 
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 I read this book as part of a book discussion group I had joined and it was so wretchedly lackluster it proved to be the death knell of me ever going back to the group. This book was half-baked, boring, and grievously devoid of even the tiniest bit of interest. I can't even give it credit for having any sort of vocabulary beyond the comprehension of an average twelve year old. The characters were so flat that I didn't even finish it. Later I heard from the other book discussion members even the title was a let down as Morgan never actually passed away (`twould have been a fitting end though - much like converting a testy horse into glue, something of actual use.) I've never read any of Anne Tyler's books but after this little gem I doubt I'll ever pick up another. 
 This book was not written by Hayek. It was written by editor and confidant W.W. Bartley when Hayek was sick and incapacitated. The only parts written by Hayek were just random notes that only show up in the appendices 
 The only reason you should buy and read this book is if it isrequired reading for a class. You are buying an advertisement for Fast Company Magazine. The writing is sketchy at best, and the examples are vague. You  get access to their Web site for online tests, but the site is poorly done  with typographical errors. There are other better texts on organizational  behavior 
 Can Quilleren and his cats figure out who is responsible for the fraud, where the president of the company is, and where all that money went? Qwilleran is a columnist in his local paper.  Everyone is in love with his column because he writes so well.  But when Floyd Trevelyan hosts a party train ride costing $500 a ticket, and says he will give the money to a charity for a college, but then things happen.  Someone calls an audit on him and he goes missing with the money.  When a dog is killed and a body is turned up suspicions rise.  Where is Floyd Trevelyan? Where is the money? Who killed the dog and the man? But then when clues pop up, and his cats Koko and Yum Yum since of mystery help, Qwilleran figures out that Floyd's new secretary killed Floyd and took the money, and the other deaths were from his son and another man in a feud.  At the end Qwilleran figures out that the secretary was really a man, and tells the cop they are looking for the wrong name. He then reads to his cats. I didn't really like this book.  There were way too many characters to keep track with.  The story line didn't go like a normal mystery.  Also, it didn't explain what happened afterwards.  In this book there were tons of characters.  So much that I couldn't even keep track of all of them.  You had to remember the whole Trevelyan family the dad, the mom, the son, and the sister.  You had to remember all of Quillerens friends, and also all his business partners and staff.  There were still many of other key people also.  Such as at the end of the book he started naming all these names that figured out the mystery and I didn't know who was who.  This book was not like a normal mystery, but not in a good way.  The whole book was like just a section of their life.  Nothing interesting happened.  There wasn't that made you wondering what was going on, or what was going to happen.  Sure there were little things you wondered about but nothing big.  This made it very boring to read this book.  It didn't even seem like a mystery until the last five pages.  Quilleren figures out the whole mystery, or at least turns the little one there was into a big one. But then after he figures it out, he basically does nothing about it.  This book left you on a cliffhanger.  It didn't explain what happened at the end.  It just stopped at Quilleran reading the book to his cat.  It didn't say if they fount the girl which was actually a man, it didn't tell what happened to all the people and if they found the body.  Also nothing ever happened between Quilleren and Patty.  It also never said where his friend went too.  So really you didn't learn anything at the end except for when he solved the mystery, but other than that, you were clueless.   This book sort of disappointed me.  There were some good things, but mostly bad things.  I wouldn't recommend it to other readers.  It didn't have bad writing, but the story was not well written.   
 This book was sooooooo boring.  I kept reading it only in the misguided hope that it would get more interesting.  It has an unlikeable and annoying main character.  The writing style is overly simple, and literally NOTHING happens.  The reason that she and her mother "fall out" is never explained.  Don't waste your time.  
 I absolutely love Deva Premal's voice and CDs.  This was a huge disappointment for me.  I don't like almost everything on this CD.  There's nothing remarkable about Miten's voice, even though it's certainly nice to listen to.  His lyrics are banal.  Sweet and heartfelt, but hackneyed. There's nothing really bad about the music, but most of it is Miten by himself (the ones with Deva are far better, to my ear), and I honestly can't find anything to recommend it. I only gave it two stars for the few songs that are predominantly Deva's voice. As much as I am dissing this CD I wouldn't hesitate to recommend "Love is Space."  So, if you're expecting something along those lines, don't get this as it's totally different 
 A patchwork of history, fiction and feminist commentary, Sontag's novel falls short in virtually every category.   The title of the book is misleading as well. This was neither the story of a volcano lover nor the narrative of a collector. It was a somewhat fractured portrait of the volcano lover's wives.   Sontag hasn't done an especially good job with character development either. Farting kings, eccentric aristocrats and bloated women jump from the pages as caricatures rather than fully developed characters.   Lord Nelson, a principal figure in the book, is never actually named, but simply referred to as "the hero." A device that falls rather flat in what tends to be a rather tedious read.  As historical fiction, Madison Smartt Bell's Haitian trilogy is far superior to Sontag's novel. And her feminist spin on a bygone era falls considerably short of Michel Faber's "The Crimson Petal and the White."  The 1,500-page-plus trilogy and 800-page-plus Faber novel by the way are quicker, more compelling reads than Sontag's much shorter, but much more boring and disjointed "romance."  Punctuation and the lack of quotation marks would be the very least of my concerns about this particular book. After all, if we can get through Ulysses or Finnegan's Wake, Sontag's fiction by comparison would qualify an easy read. No...there's much more missing here than quotation marks.  
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 The author has good intentions but uses poor judgement in citing statistics. Example page 23-24 claims 1:10 adults have HIV and 1:4 adolescents girls have HIV. This author has cited several sources including the CDC and the US censes bureau.  A simple check of there web sites would have disproved this. I don't like when somebody manipulates emotions with bogus statistics. I think there is a major league issue of scholar dishonesty here. When a book has flawed documentation and lies this completely undermines its content. Good intentions; Seriously disappointing 
 This book might be helpful as a starting point for someone who knows nothing about lymphedema. It read like a tired retread of the information the American Cancer Society dispenses for free. Since I experience a direct  correlation between protein intake and arm swelling, I was hoping the  authors would go into far greater diet detail than their short chapter on  nutritional supplements. Save your money -- there is nothing new here 
  This is a complex and detailed history chiefly of Cuban exiles in South Florida and the influence they have been able to wield regionally and internationally with and without the help of various U.S. administrations. In that sense, it is the story of two cities - Miami and Washington - and two peoples - Americans and Cubans.    I have an objection, though, with the stone-hard style in which this volume is so meticulously, even gorgeously at times, written. Didion strives to be so achingly academic that there is little real heart to this book and, worse, the result is a cold, humorless, colorless story that is at times an unappealing example of ideological abstractions and alphabet soup.   The author, in her conspicuously clean and parenthetical prose, apparently is so charged by the subject of her research that she has forgotten there are people on the other end - readers. It is, in that sense, a boring little disaster of a book.  
 This is a fragment of a book.  While it is well written, has good characters and some very interesting concepts, it fails for lack of a plot.  The story seems to stop right when it should just be getting interesting.  This is a pity since everything else was in place to make it a truly good book.  I was very frustrated and disappointed.     
 Let me tell you something that I really can't stand. An instructor  who assigns a book that you have to pay full price for and only assigns 3 chapters for you to read. I hated this book. It was a waste of time reading it and a waste of money. I tried to sell this book back and was offered $0.00 for it. So what does that tell you? I eventually threw the book in the trash because that's where it belonged. I couldn't enjoy Brants Native American culture without her mixing her lesbianism into it. I have no interest in that type of combination at all and I don't give a rats behind about her "liquid energy" and getting caught being intimate with her friend. If you insist reading this book, get it from the library 
 Infested (Josh Olson, 2002)  It's really kind of impressive that a movie this bad doesn't get shelved somewhere along the line. And yet here it is, in all its painfully cheesy glory, on my screen, daring me to turn it off. I almost gave in to the temptation, but I kept watching. For you, dear reader, so I can give you a full account of the true horror to be found here-- the ninety minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back if you rent this movie and sit down to watch it.   The story, what there is of it: A number of friends show up at the estate of one of their high-school buddies, who's killed himself. There's all the post-funeral bonding stuff, and everything's looking remarkably Big Chill when things go horribly, horribly wrong thanks to vicious, genetically-altered flies that possess humans and turn them into soulless murderers. Yes, you got that right.   As usual, the only reason to watch a movie like this is the cheesecake factor. Any Jo Johnson plays the dead guy's girlfriend (well, ex, I guess), and there is an obligatory scene where she shows a whole lot of skin. It is not, however, an out-and-out nude scene. Sorry, guys. There is also the gorgeous Lisa Ann Hadley (General Hospital/Port Charles), who's really starting to look like Kate Hodge. (This is a good thing. A very good thing.)  You're certainly not watching for the special effects, (amateur even by microbudget-indie standards), the acting (atrocious), the script (even worse), the direction (competent at best), the cinematography (ditto), the soundtrack (cheesy early eighties pop that should have faded into obscurity years ago), or, really, anything else. So it's gotta be the cheesecake. And that's all well and good, but you can do that on fast-forward. I strongly suggest that route. At least you'll waste less time on this. (half 
 The book I read for LA, The Heavenly Village by Cynthia Rylant, was the most amazingly, outstandingly, unbelievably BORING book I've read this year. I could not believe that this book was ever written. The book is about some accountant who never believed in the heaven idea so when he dies he goes to the heavenly village because he is "not quite ready for heaven". In this village he becomes the timekeeper, which is a very special job that not just any one can do but he gets to because he's so gosh-darn good at math.This book was the most I've read about nothing in my life. Rylant's description of the accountant going to the village was random and insensible. Now, when anyone describes the experience of traveling to heaven, it is hard and almost takes energy to not make it sound at least a little moving and touching, but this book destroys the whole concept of it. I mean, you mine as well read a description of the perfect utopia... by Edger Allan Poe. Cynthia Rylant ruined the idea of this heavenly village that could have been some of an idea. I would recommend this book to no one on earth for no one; and I mean no one, deserves this amount of boredom that I had to experience. This book should have never been written. 
 I did not care for this book! Almost all of his data is limited to 1999 to 2000. A much better book on the subject is "The Research Driven Investor" by Timothy Hayes. Save your money on Headley's book, you can have mine for free 
 This book is a very easy to read seemingly well documented work but it will not provide the reader with Thomas Jefferson in historical context. If your interest is in what Mr. Jefferson accomplished during his life and the many great achievements that he participated in on behalf the formation of the United States I would pass up this work.  If your interest lies in his carnal side and his personal sexual history this might be more your speed.  Had I known this was the piece of fluff that it turned out to be I would not have wasted my money on this work.  This book would probably be a good basis for daytime TV couch potato fare.  It is hardly a good work of historical content and most likely would have been rejected by any Masters level thesis committee.  Most of this book could be condensed into one chapter. On a number of occasions Mr Halliday lets his own personal political bias color his image of Mr. Jefferson pushing this work even further from the vein of relevant history. I picked up this work based upon the recommendations on the inside cover.  I have always been impressed with the historical works of Mr. Ambrose but I believe that there must have been more to his review. 
 In my usual perusal of the thrift shops for 25 cent novels, i came across this interesting find summer of 2005.  from the very first page, the book had me hooked. merricat blackwood is a girl i could relate to on first degree. in her family, she's a bit of a misfit, and as  a consequence, finds herself and her older sister constance locked away in their large old house as the town freaks after the *mysterious* death of their entire family at dinner on night.  everyone hates them and wants them gone. merricat braves walking to town to buy groceries for her sister with cash from the vast amount of wealth they keep hidden in the house. the towns people sneer at merricat and ask her to leave and she, head lifted, tries bravely to remain unafraid.  it is an all together marvelous book for anyone who enjoys the cryptic events that go on behind the scenes of creepy old houses.  
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 Thin, cliche plot.  Poorly researched by one who never served, who obviously has no particular affections for the US Army. Couldn't even convince myself to finish it 
 A book about a self-absorbed, narcissitic, selfish, emotionally draining, emotionally immature, and delusional woman who tries to pass herself off as an artist. Nearly two decades ago a friend of mine gave to me a copy of "The Artist's Way." I loved it and over the years have given many copies of it as gifts to people in my life. I, too, purchased "The Vein of Gold" when it was first released. Based upon these books I expected a life of a generous, balanced, sane woman. My intuition when I saw her photo on the back of the book told me to beware. She looks like a psycho in her photo and that is who I found her to be in her own words. For one who claims to be spiritual I found only endless drama, addiction, and self-absorbtion in her tale of herself. It is frightening to know that this woman earns the money she does. I stopped writing my morning pages for a few days because I feared becoming as warped as Julia Cameron. She rants and rages about eveyone in her life being addicted to money, fame, and fortune while ignoring her endless addictions. Writing is not art to her, it is an addiction. She is addicted to herself. I pity her daughter who had, in essence, to rear herself and be a mother to Ms. Cameron, because Ms. Cameron was too sick and self absorbed to even be present for her daughter. Ms. Cameron is the most dangerous of minds:one who thinks that she is spiritual and holier than thou while living for nothing but herself. The amount of fossil fuel alone that she has consummed for all her dozens of cross-country moves is enough to make any sane person sick over her lack of conscious living. She is all that is wrong with this country. Sadly, I do know of many dedicated, sane, and endlessly giving and available writing teachers. Ms. Cameron is not one of them. Never again will I give a copy of "The Artist's Way" as a gift. I cannot support such vanity. I pray that she gets the help she needs for her mental illness. If the book were well written, perhaps I could find compassion for her. But, alas, it is a tome of her excusing her endlessly unacceptable behavoir. 
 The 4 CD mini Gibson Amp 'box-set'leaves off genuine off vinyl 78, and Lp 'harder-to-get' Charlie Christian/Benny Goodman recordings.  Legacy states "MASTER TAKES", but absolutely fails to research deep into Charlie Christian's recording history. Columbia vinyl 2Lp 30779, (1972), and Columbia 78rpm C -102 along with the Columbia "Sextet" Cds leave legacy far behind. The Wang Wang Blues -78rpm isn't in the 4CD set, and there are far too many 'false-starts', which Benny Goodman discarded for a good reason.  Star Dust is only about 3 minutes, it's 8 minutes on vinyl.  There is even In-studio handclapping after some tunes. I have the 78s, many Col. Lps, and there is no "Studio-Live" takes.  This 4 CD box could have, and should have been much better in information, content and genuine Charlie Christian guitar stylings.  The 2 readily available BG Sextet Cds are a better purchase idea, but there are still those super hard-to-get vinyl Lp tracks, which ARE "The Master Takes", left Off the legacy/Sony box set.  Musicologist's suggestion, try to get the vinyl Lps.  Skip this misleading 4 CD set of various tracks, + handclapping = NOT "Good Enough To Keep", (AirMail Special). Try the 2 Benny Goodman/Charlie Christian Columbia CDs, Amazon has both, and most of the Benny Goodman Sextet 'takes' are Master Takes, and "Good Enough To Keep! 
 This book was much thinner than I had expected and is devoid of color except for a few pages in the middle. Not much for the whopping price 
 Not worth it honestly for the price. It was not what I thought it would be because I was hoping it'll be similar to 200-thread count. The fabric is like nylon and created a lot of static. I think it is good for sofas or futons and the burgundy is a nice color. 
 I'm sure that this hair dryer is of exceptional quality - perhaps worth the price to some. But I'd be careful about buying something that uses fake science babble to try to convince you of its effectiveness. "most ionic and infrared" is gibberish. Tourmaline, a gemstone, has electrical properties (when squeezed or heated, it develops a charge across the crystal), but that has nothing to do with hair drying, or ionizing air, or anything else. I'd recommend buying a less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead of falling for a pseudoscientific scam 
 This book was written for people who truly have no clue how to act in any kind of professional setting.  I was already aware that I should not use "quick and dirty" or "snafu" in a professional environment.  It was a waste of money 
 I'm not a fan of memoirs, but I thought to give this one a shot. Boy, was that a mistake. As most memoirs I have read, this is way too self-indulgent and self-pitying to my liking. It claims to be honest, but I highly doubt it is. The writing is bad. Some characters and events are mentioned for seemingly no reason. It appears Ms. Zailckas confused writing a memoir with writing a diary 
 Why is this? Why are Arabic instruction books sooooo atrocious? There is sufficient demand for Arabic now and sufficient research in language education to come up with something better. What a sad testament that Al Kitaab is actually the standard in university-level Arabic instruction! It makes me want to rip my hair out. Somebody, anybody, PLEASE publish a decent Arabic instruction text. And, for all you publishers out there doing colloquial Arabic: EGYPTIAN!!  A third of all Arabs are Egyptian and it's the only dialect universally understood by other Arabs. So please quit with all the Lebanese, Saudi, Iraqi, Jordnaian colluquial courses until there is a decent Egyptian course available 
 This book doesnt help, its just keywords and blank papers. I wouldn't buy it again 
 Here's an update to one of Peterson's quotes about Hurricane Katrina:   "About five years ago, in a debate before the National Association of Black Journalists, I stated that if whites were to just leave the United States and let blacks run the country, they would turn America into a ghetto within 10 years. The audience, shall we say, disagreed with me strongly. Now I have to disagree with me. I gave blacks too much credit. It took a mere three days for blacks to turn the Superdome and the convention center into ghettos, rampant with theft, rape and murder."   Wow that's really showing some LOVE and compassion for the victims! Never mind the fact that the blacks who were not doing those things shouldn't be lumped together with those who did! This man is heartless towards his own people which is really sad! He's very much out of touch and a white a** kisser!   This is the same man who said that blacks don't need reparations because they should be happy with all the opportunities they get in this country! Never mind the fact that reparations is a **debt owned** and not a handout! Never mind the fact that blacks still face discrimination in this country! Did he have a problem with the Jews getting reparations along with all others except blacks?   Now this sell out is pointing the finger more at the black mayor of New Orleans, never mind the fact that the governor has more power than the mayor! Yet all this man does is attack blacks from left to right! Some white person must be paying him to do this!   I agree with some of his points about immorality in the black community and greedy black "leaders" but what this man needs to do is come up with some solutions instead of the childish finger pointing that's just going to cause even more trouble!   I have to agree with some of the folks who posted negative reviews of his book. This man is one self hating Uncle Tom and one reason he mentioned being called an Uncle Tom was because he asked a black pastor that why instead of handing out condoms to his congregation why doesn't he just promote abstinence, which is good since the fact that condoms aren't 100% proof but what this man is not giving the pastor credit for is that by passing out condoms free just like they do in clinics, he's still promoting safe sex and that he can't force folks to practice abstinence so at least he's doing something. But since this Peterson sell out thinks that blacks are good for nothings then he probably doesn't care to see us procreate! Maybe that's the real reason he wants blacks to practice abstinence!    
 This is a very cheaply made product that does not stand up to any child play.  My sons got this recently and within 24 hours one of the sticks had broken.  The company was nice enough to send a new one out but now (only a few weeks later) the plastic on the goal is shattered.  The goal also does not stay together very well and comes apart with each goal scored.  Overall, I would highly discourage you from wasting quite a bit of money for plastic that will not hold up to child play!! 
 I was intrigued by the concept of a detective mystery set in Tang Dynasty China.  Unfortunately the author hasn't mastered the essentials of writing a really good novel.  The characters didn't feel believable, the dialogue is stiff and unnatural, and the plot is slow-moving and contrived 
 McCarthy is a very talented writer (read Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses) but he is also known for a very melodramatic style of writing, using many archaic words. Suttree is written is this style and one could say it is 471 pages of melodrama without a plot. Despite the novel's length it is very underdeveloped and the reader is not sure why he should even care about the main character. Certain chapters are interesting (the workhouse chapter especially), but these passages are few and far between. Also the violence at times is ridiculous and does nothing to advance his ever prevalent theory that the world has always been this way and will continue in this way. McCarthy writes about nature beautifully, but after finishing this book, one is left unfulfilled. 
 Don't waste your money on this book. I got it thinking it was going to be an interesting, fact-based, well-researched book on Mary Magdalene. Instead it was a hate-filled attack on not only Christianity but on Jesus Himself, describing Him as a drunken and gluttonous Egyptian magician no different than any other "nut" in Palestine claiming to be the Messiah. I really have nothing to add that hasn't been said in the many other negative reviews that this book gotten. As mentioned before by other reviewers, the author has a personal and childish agenda against Christ and the entire religion of Christianity and it is so transparent. Not only is the research flawed, with major misunderstandings about basic Christian beliefs like the Immaculate Conception, Apostolic Succession,the Authority of the Pope, et cetera, but as a psychologist I can see, in my opinion, some major emotional problems with this author. I won't go into a case study of her that I could come up with after reading her book,but the main problem is that after losing the high of her conversion experience, which she readily admits, she goes into the other extreme of hating Jesus and God and the Church and trying to keep up the high of that experience by writing a "National Enquirer" type of book to try to tear down Christianity.I was stunned and sickened by the venom she spewed onto Jesus and her sad and flimsy attempt to raise up Mary Magdalene into some kind of goddess. Sorry Lynn, but you have failed miserably.Not only is your book going into my garbage can, but it has strongly reinforced my love for Christ and my committment to His Church and the wonderful gift He has given to us in his life, death, and Resurrection. May God have mercy on your soul.. 
 Ok, first of all, what the hell?! What was it called, huh? Backstreet Boys, THE HITS? They don't have hits! they have dumb songs about girls even though they're a bunch of guys spending time together not doing anything but singing in their innocent, smooth, lame voices. And they had the nerve to call this "The Hits, CHAPTER ONE". I can't believe this, I thought they were done. I thought the world was rid of boy bands. I remember actually buying the millenium cd, when I thought N'Sync and the Backstreet Boys were cool. Then I was dumb, foolish, naive, and many more things, as I wasted (my Mom's) money on a cd filled with this crud they call music. Some people may like that crud, but not me. I want to introduce these Backstreet Boys to some of my favorite bands. AC/DC! Led Zeppelin! Guns N' Roses! U2! Van Halen! Def Leppard! Metallica! The Ramones! Scorpions! Aerosmith! These are all bands that ROCK! These are bands that have INSTRUMENTS, and do more than sing the most pointless lyrics. I really HATE boy bands. So if I could, I would put 0 STARS 
 I am an Electrical Engineer in graduate school studying Information Systems and this book was definitely written for professionals currently in the IS industry, working in systems analysis. The book illustrates  techniques in a very broad manner and utilizes vague generalizations.  Definitely NOT for  inexperienced IS individuals 
      It starts out with this Mexican family illegally coming across the border into the United States. When they get to the U.S., they go to a labor camp in California. This first labor camp is probably the best one that they go to. The whole book is about this family moving around to different labor camps during different crop seasons. Every now and then, Francisco and his brother Roberto go to school. Along the way there are more people added to the family. The book doesn't really come to a good ending. It is also kind of hard to understand because it jumps three years into the future at times and then you don't know what's going on. 	This was a very good book at some times but most of the time the author put in way too many unnecessary details that make the book kind of boring. This book is exactly like it's sequel, Breaking Through. I would rate this book pretty low if like a lot of action.  
 It's World War I. There's death and dispair and darkness everywhere and yet amidst all the anguish, there comes the tale of two lovers and their sad struggle to live a complete life. It's the daring anti-war classic from the late great Ernest Hemmingway- A Farewell to Arms!  Sounds pretty promising, huh? Let's see how it REALLY is.  First things first, the Lovers- Fred Henry is an American in the Italian army. He begins the story feeling rather mildly about the war and life in general until he accidentally falls in love and things begin to change. He is a totally self-absorbed, unsympathetic dick. He narrates the story and yet somehow we get little insight into any of his deeper emotions or motives. I literally hated him by the end. Catherine Barkley is a beautiful English nurse who Henry falls for. She's still healing from her last lovers death when she meets him. At first she seems like she might turn out to be at least somewhat intresting, but the hope vanishes everytime she opens her mouth. She is  shallow, moronic, ridiculous, and one of the most unrealistic and dislikable females characters I've ever read. Henry, however, falls desperately in love with her and her thick head of blond hair.  Next we have the plot- As you know, it's WWI. Things aren't going so well. Henry mets Catherine. Henry gets injured and falls in love with Catherine. They spend almost all their time remarking how "sweet" and "fine" the other is and reassuring eachother they're really in love. Then they have some sex and Catherine gets pregnant. Henry cares somewhat. He's then forced to go back to war, however, but not before Catherine tells him she feels like a whore when he takes her to a hotel. This is the only intresting thing she ever says but she quickly retracts the statement as to not upset dear, darling Henry. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Henry deserts the army. This is one of the few exciting parts. Unfortunately, though, Henry soon goes back to Catherine. This is where is book takes a turn for the worst. The lovers breifly share happiness until Catherine has her baby, the baby dies and at last Catherine dies. Tragic.   My Opinion- The book is dull. When Catherine died I was just glad the book was over. The prose in this novel is some of the most boring and terse I've ever read. The dialouge is some of the most irriating. Between Henry's emotionless "Yes", "No"s, and "All right"s and Catherine's pointless, opinionless chatter, I'm not sure how anyone could be grabbed or moved in the slightest. Neither character had much going for them and I couldn't care less about their miserable fates. Hemmingway could have turned this into something so much better if only he gave his readers some likeable people who we could love and relate to. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought his was the biggest waste of an idea ever. Cheers 
 The good info. here is very good but there's so much more winded, no-where going storyline info that's so unneccessary 
 I'm an English Teacher and I had my students purchase this pocket book. The past two years of purchasing this book has been a waste of time and money for both parties 
 This woman is no biblical scholar. She does not need to worry. I am sure she will never be mistaken for a Proverbs 31 woman.  Egalitarians make a case that the man is not over the woman in the home--that was a result of the fall. Yet, we wear clothing as a result of the fall; yes, we are under the New Covenant through Jesus, but we still wear clothing. We sin as a result of the fall; under the New Covenant we still sin. Women have pain in childbirth as a result of the fall; women still have pain in childbirth, today, under the New Covenant. Yes, the man is the head over the woman in the home as a result of the fall, and he is STILL the ordained covering, leader, and head over the woman and the home under the New Covenant.  One thing these women such as this author conveniently dismiss is that women will want to rule over men as a result of the fall.  At least this book was worth reading for me (and worthy of one star), because it reinforced my traditional beliefs and made me want to have nothing to do with the egotistical spirit at work in the feminist movement of pride, and power and control. 
 I bought this CD on the strength of hearing Ms. Melua sing "The Closest Thing to Crazy" on the Craig Ferguson Show. She was backed by a three piece and the stripped down, sultry effect sent chills up my spine. HOWEVER, upon getting the CD,it is a fully orchestrated, over produced piece of crap. Most of the songs are OK and you can see the potential, but the producer should be shot. It is not at all what I expected and is gathering dust in a cabinet. I have resolved to never buy another CD without sampling the tracks. Lesson learned 
 Very much in need of a revision. The authors made mistakes on the maps in this edition. In the past we depended on these series to guide us around Europe and thought they would lead the way for Maui too. If you purchase this book, buy a current map to go with it 
 After reading Brian Green's "The Elegant Universe", I wanted to learn more on the possibility of a world made of more than 4 dimensions, time included. L. Krauss seemed to offer the opportunity not only to learn more about these extra dimensions based on scientific knowledge but also to melt it with an insightful adventure into the history of human creativity which has already imagined such world. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Both the scientific and artistic parts are poor and shallow, a shame when the explanation of a multidimension world is at stake. The rhetoric has nothing of the passion and the doors-opening of Brian Green's book. Too bad 
 Ok, I have LOVED Sophie since she hit the scene. But what the heck happen here? I'm stuck somewhere in the mid-beginning. I'm going to go back and finish it and will add to the review then, but right now I'm at a lost for words. Sophie come back! 
 I agree with the reviewer who mentioned unfinished subplots and unexplained sequences. I gave this movie a chance because I am a huge john candy fan and had never heard of it, but, I know that often, sleeper movies can be buried gems just waiting to be found (a la benny and joon)but this wasnt one of them im afraid. I found this movie mildly amusing, John Candy does very well but overall, the movie doesnt hold up to his other movies. The ending was dissapointing and there were too many, as above mentioned, unfinished subplots. Was there supposed to be some sort of development with the John Larroquette sequence? that was really a pointless addition other than to give the family somewhere to go while Candy learned his sailing and yeah, what was wrong with the popcorn? I loved you John Candy and i miss you dearly,you'll always have a place in my heart, however, this movie will probably never be watched again. I will see you again, in planes, trains and automobiles.  
 Alright, I downright hated this book! All it talks about how this part Chincoteague part Thoroughbred becomes a superstar like all of the horse books that are written now. It is like no duh the horse is going to win because the horse is the main character of the book! And, what kind of nickname is "Twi"? It's downright stupid. I just hated this book and I can not believe that some many people actually like this book. I think that the best illustration was when the ugly rat had her ribs sticking out. The worst was when she was doing all of the dressage moves. I mean, they only teach those moves at the Spanish Riding School, so Rat should not know them, especially a near perfect capriole 
 Just got the pressure cooker, and it looks like a great, heavy duty pot.  Very nice.  Because of the other reviews, my main purpose in purchasing this was for canning.  However, after reading the manual, I learned that this CAN NOT be used at altitudes above 3,000 feet -- which leaves out a lot of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah......  Otherwise, I'm sure it's great 
 This isn't one story, but seven. One for every one of the papa mouse's sons as they lay in bed. They are but a few pages, and most all of them aren't very good. This book is best for those ages 2 or 3, through 8 or so 
 I dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap-opera like compulsion, always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our Lord.  Therefore, I anticipated this final novel to be glorious, as the title indicates, but I was woefully wrong.  Are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming King and His Kingdom?  Certainly not!    I support Christian fiction with many 5 star reviews,--just look at my other reviews--but I can not recommend this series 
 The case itself was falling apart. It was impossible to get the thread through the needle hole either, so this product was a total waste of money on my part 
 OK, I figure if you're looking at this CD, you're a Laurie Anderson fan and can recall at least twice you've seen her great concert movie, likely at a midnight showing back in the 80's.  Well, if you're that person, avoid the utter heartbreak which is this CD.  I counted 18 tracks from my old VHS copy of this concert, while only 8 made it to the CD.  The banter between tracks is omitted entirely.  The tracks are out of order (OK, small nitpick), and it's certainly not worth the effort.  I'm sorry, Laurie, but Warner scr-wed you hard on this one.  On the up side, the sound quality is good, certainly better than my VHS.  But hey, this is a concert film soundtrack, but apparently they forgot to include the second disk.  Laurie fans will be livid.  (Others merely confused!  : 
 Robert Allen's previous book, Multiple Streams of Income, is EXCELLENT and I can't say enough good things about it.  This one was a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT in comparison.  He talks about the same rehashed Internet marketing strategies that everyone else does.  Creating email lists, newsletters, blah, blah, blah...  The most disappointing thing about Robert Allen -- and I lost so much respect for him over this -- is that he demonstrates how to get a bunch of people to order his product within minutes of putting out an email blast.  What's stupid about the whole thing, and demonstrates that he's a snakeoil salesman scam artist, is that what he's selling by email is a course on how to make money on the Internet...so how do you make money on the Internet?  According to Robert Allen, by selling courses showing people how to make money on the Internet is the only way to make money on the Internet.  That's a scam!  How does he sleep at night?  Don't buy this book.  It's a waste of money 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope 
 I read about one hundred pages and then, when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding, I quit. This was my first King book and I am not rushing out to buy another one, especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a 1000 pages.  Is it any wonder that it is selling on Amazon for a penny? Actually, I would not even pay that for a product that is as exciting as a bag of wet hair 
 This book contains some useful historical information and some insights into the mass psychology of booms, bubbles, and busts.  Prechter should have left it at that.  Instead, he offers up predictions.  Big mistake.  This guy bases his forecasts on Fibonacci numbers and so-called Elliott "wave counts."   He labels all market patterns so that they fit the preordained Elliott Wave 5-up, 3-down pattern.  If you see more or fewer waves than he does in any given market move, you just don't understand that there can only be 5 waves to the top of a bull market.  He's imposing his theory on the market, but surprisingly enough, the market doesn't care.  It does whatever it wants, in however many waves it wants, and Bob has been very frustrated at the market's aberrant behavior lately.  He got lucky early in his career, but it seems he's been fairly consistently getting the market wrong since missing the '87 crash.    Any superstitution can "seem" to work if you only look at its happenstance apparent accuracies and disregard its abundant failures.  Keep looking for certain numbers of waves and Fibonacci ratios and you'll find what you're looking for.  Pick any set of numbers or patterns or wave counts, and you'll find those too.  The market doesn't care about any of those things, though.  It's nothing more than an aggregation of billlions of individual choices, which are influenced by an infinite number of factors none of us can ever understand fully.  University studies of various investing methods have found that Elliott Wave, like most, is no better than random stock selection.   If Prechter had chosen the random method, he and his followers would at least have a good chance of keeping pace with the market.  Unfortunately, he has been getting everything from the Dow, to oil (he thought it was going to $10), to gold (he didn't think it could break $400), to deflation (the "deflation" scare ended shortly after this book came out) WRONG in the past couple of years.  He apparently STILL believes that the Dow will go to 400 (not 4,000 but FOUR HUNDRED) because his charts tell him it should (they've been telling him that since about 1990, actually).  Prechter doesn't understand demographics or economics or markets or the monetary system, all of which render "Dow 400" among the goofiest of forecasting absurdities -- unless you believe a giant asteroid will hit and wipe out two thirds of the population (I don't think Prechter is counting on that).  Our debt-heavy economy may have a significant crisis soon, perhaps by the end of the decade.  It will most likely be spurred on by inflation and rising interest rates.  But it's not happening now and it's not happening in the way this author has been prematurely forecasting for over a decade.  This book came out near the bottom of the 2000-2002 stock bear market, just in time for a reader to short stocks as they began a new bull market.  How typical.  While promoting the book, Prechter said it was "definite" that stocks would "crash" in 2003.  He said that 2003 would be "the best year yet" for bears (short sellers).  Late into 2003, when it was clear that the market had proven him wrong, Prechter declared on a radio show that by the end of 2004, the Dow would "certainly" fall below 5,000.  Wrong again!  Since his Fibonacci turn dates and Elliott wave counts fail to portend the future, maybe next he'll tell us he's found the secret code to the stock market from the text count of Nostradamus' writings.  Bob Prechter couldn't call the market if it was listed in the Yellow Pages.  This guy couldn't time the market if you gave him a stopwatch.  He's throwing out guesses and misleading people by describing them as "definite" and "certain."  He's either a liar or a true believer in his own irrational superstitions.  In either case, he's not credible.  Here's all you really need to know: Buy dividend stocks.  Buy short-term bonds.  Buy gold.  Hang on to them.  Do that and you'll do better than you will trying to follow the prognostications of market gurus.  Plus, you'll have a lot more time to devote to family, fun, and productive activities 
 The orchestrations and chorus present on all of the regular tracks intended to make him more palatable to a wider audience suck the soil right out of Ray Charles' performances.  This is particularly evident when you hear the bonus tracks.  The bonus tracks are fabulous, but I'm sure you can find them on another Ray Charles album 
 The hit single ''Get Over It'', is one of my favorite songs.  Musically and lyrically it's near perfection.  However the rest of the album is pretty much generic.  I expect that a album has atleast 3 or 4 really good songs in order to be considered a good album.  My advice is to get the single if it's available here on Amazon, or to spend $.99 at iTunes(if it's available there as well) 
 I wonder how long it will be before Frost's literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be. These are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. Frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader. What he has to say is obvious and unoriginal. How he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no better than a limerick. Posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his celebrity image as the New England farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed. How earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding. Bad poetry from a twisted man 
 I love werewolves, and I eagerly bought this book though wanted to return it when I was finished. This book, though beautifully written, has flat, one-dimensional, underdeveloped characters and majorly underdeveloped relationships. Kern and Ainsy barely knew each other and they rushed into sex just like that. Ainsy started out as a strong female character, sometimes snappish but a sweetheart on the inside, and she ends up a helpless damsel in distress when I expected her to tell off the harper and give him a good slap. The plot was thin, with not enough emotion, and the characters simply go with the flow, never developing their own characteristics. But the prose is excellent and breath-taking; I'd like to read other books from this author, though I'll check them out from a library first. The author has a fantastic way with words 
 This is a little far fetched but bare with, a London born Actress transplants herself to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap...and then writes about a London born Actress being transplanted  to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap. Got it? Personally this psuedo semiautobiographical novel about Hughes life (or lack there of) is testament that some actors should remain just that! The cynical nature in which her character sees Los Angles and the people surrounding her is way too close to accurate for this to be classified as true "fiction" and the parallels between her main "villain" Meredith Contini and a certain fabulous legendary New York Based All My Children icon is so blatant it borders on insulting. Her work on General Hospital was good, Her work on All My Children was tolerable, at best, but her work as a writer makes me ashamed to admit Finola Hughes is a fellow Brit. 
 I cannot believe this is the same person who wrote that fantastic book, Absolute Power.  David, what happened????  The story is very fascinating but the characters were not.  I found myself rooting for the villian who is definitely a very bad person.  But our herione, LuAnn, is not believable.  He has her as a backward hick who does not have a social security number on one hand and then he has her acting like a genius on the other hand.  There were just too many up and downs for me.  I am sure the next book will be back on track 
 Dude his horrible. Almost every song he has ever done should go on the worst songs ever list... He has no melody, and his lyrics are mediocre.  Worst of all, he looks like Private Pyle from Full Metal Jacket.  LOSER 
 First of all, isn't there something to be said for aesthetics when it comes to covers?  Well, then, the cover definitely has to be altered.  Maybe they could put a picture of a house plant on there or something to represent this guy's personality.  Secondly, the book tries to take itself way too seriously.  and C. Polite? Timid? Is this guy supposed to be funny. I thought  he was a serious art critic, then I start in and he's talking all this politix crapola.  Is this guy a comedian or not?  I thought he had a show on amazon. I once saw him do stand-up comedy and he was funny.  He talked about funny things.  But here, this ain't no pulitzer writing 'dat for for sure. Maybe he try again, but I afraid his publisher no like any more and he have to self-publish, mebbee.  I'd rather read Dr. Seuss -- this fox ain't got no sox and his ham and egss is done greened on him 
 If I could I would give this book two and a half stars, but 2 will do.  I am a complete noob when it comes to Linux and got this book for class.  The book is getting really outdated.  I had several different problems installing fedora and it was no hope.  Not a great guide for a true beginner but makes a decent reference.  I like a lot of examples when starting something new and the examples in this book are lacking.  For being 1,000 pages its surprising what is left out 
 The SkinTight cover is cool. Works pretty well with the unit, but the belt clip SUCKS! It's big and bulky and locks in over the mute switch on the Treo and it sometimes slides the mute switch over to mute or vise versa. 
 The problem I have with this album is that I expect to hear the songs as recorded for the movie, "Little Voice".  After all, it is a sound track recording, isn't it? Wrong. It is a deceptive compilation of  recordings by the various artists whose songs are heard in the film rather  than by the artist who actually sings many of these songs in the film.   Many of the songs in the film are interpretations by Jane Horrocks, not by  the original artist, yet only two of the songs on the 'sound track' album  are recorded by Jane Horrocks. I was absolutely spellbound by Horrocks'  performance and it was a great disappointment to discover that I could not  savour her voice and songs on this album. If I wanted to hear the songs as  recorded by Shirley Bassey, Judy Garland and Ethel Merman, I would have  purchased their respective albums.  I can only hope that Jane Horrocks  produces her own album.  Until then, I will purchase the VCR of  "Little Voice" and listen to the talented Jane Horrocks. I give  the 'sound track' recording one star for its content, and five stars if you  care to consider its fraudulent content 
 The exercises in the book seem to be purposefully difficult.  Is this to discourage prospective copyeditors or so that Einsohn can show off her years of experience?  In order to be instructional, the explanations should fully cover the concepts that one will be tested on in the exercises.  Anyone who can read should be able to read the text and then successfully complete the exercises.  This is basic to good instructional design. Instead, in the exercises, Einsohn throws in the exceptions to the rules or tests on concepts only hinted at in the text.  Einsohn reminds me of the bad teachers we have all experienced at one time or another who get satisfaction from confusing students by talking around a subject instead of teaching the subject directly.  Success of students is not the goal of these teachers.  There are many finer points in copyediting, but there are sets of rules governing them all.  It should be a simple matter to present the rules and then test the student on those rules 
 the author seems to write backwards. it requires too much effort to unscrambe 100 words to get at the 5 meaningful words. i personally dont have the time to suffer through it 
 I absolutely love the first 2 installments from this Now collection.  I was so excited to see what was going to be on the 3rd release.  What a dissapointment...  All of the tracks are mediocre and they even have the nerve to include 2 songs included on the previous version.  Little Saint Nick by The Beach Boys and Winter Wonderland by Louis Armstrong.  What!?  Would they include duplicate songs on the regular Now Hits CD's??? I think not.  If you don't have Now Christmas 1 or 2, I highly suggest getting those versus the lame 3 installment.  I can't wait until next year to see if they improve or just keep trying to sell the public the same songs as 1, 2, and 3.  Merry Christmas 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 Elmore Leonard is one of the more respected of popular contemporary authors, and deservingly so.  He has a wonderful ear for dialogue and the impressive ability to both generate plot and develop characters through it.  What many authors may describe in several paragraphs or pages, Leonard does in a few lines of dialogue.  As such, his books are tremendously quick and enjoyable reads.  However, 'Be Cool' is not one of his best.  The concept is interesting enough: a sequel.  And not just that, but a sort of metafictional work poking fun at the whole idea of sequels.  Chili Palmer returns, trying to get his foot in the door of the music industry.  As always, the protagonist is surrounded by an odd assortment of hitmen, cons, and scattered goofballs.  However, when reading 'Be Cool' I couldn't shake the feeling that the book was rushed.  Many of the character (the cop, the gangsta rapper) are scarcely developed at all (the latter, in particular, could have been a rich source of satire).  Also, the ending seemed rushed, as well.  Leonard seemed to be racing towards it without building up much tension.  The reader reaches the last page and wonders what was the point of the second half of the book.  I'd always recommend Elmore Leonard as a quick, enjoyable, "beach" read.  However, go with something else of his instead of 'Be Cool. 
 I found this book totally impractical and a waste of money for cooking in a small RV.   It might be okay for the person with a 40 foot motorhome with a complete kitchen and all the comforts of home.  Many of the recipes contain ingredients that I don't even keep at home.  Access to perishables and fresh produce is assumed although the authors mention cooking in the middle of the Mohave Desert in the Introduction. Who takes cloth napkins on a camping trip (and where do you wash them)?  A much more useful book is "Easy RV Recipes: Easy Recipes for the Traveling Cook" by Ferne Holmes. 
 I love history, but it has to have a decent narrative.  This book does have history, but a good narrative appears sporadically.  While better than scholarly writing, this just won't keep you glued to your seat.  If you can push yourself to finish you deserve a pat on the back, but don't buy this book if you need to be enthralled 
 Like most of those who wrote reviews, I am waiting expectantly for the next DAN BROWN novel.  I so appreciate the reviews that let me know MATTER is not that book.  
 While the writing was acceptable, I felt that the juxtaposition of the classes in this novel was very forced.  The differnce between the classes is too obvious.  The contrast between the rich world (the students in the Wilcox school and the Cornhills) and the streets of London (and Isa's forced marriage to the grocer, and Mrs. Cornhill's predictable and obvious snobbery) was not one that led me to feel any of the injustice.  I was left cold by the overall plot.  One thing that truly bothered me was the fate of Mr. Cornhill and Isa.  I felt that the way it happened in the book left something to be desired, and was not in true Bronte style.  The characters and their development also left something to be desired.  They were too predictable at times, and Mr. Ellin was just annoying.  There were few occasions when I sympathized with any character, other than Isa (and only at certain points in the plot). There was nothing spectacular about this novel, though I won't discourage anyone from reading it.  It was fast paced and it did hold my interest.  
 Actually not going to be kind........... What a load of RUBBISH 
 Western Michigan University Professor John Blacking (1928-1990) prefaces his intended answer to the titular question, How Musical is Man?, with the qualification that this work - originally printed in 1973 - is "not a scholarly study, so much as an attempt to reconcile my experiences." With this in mind, the reader should not be surprised to find a self-indulgent speculative which walks a fine line between narrowly focused ethnomusicologic comparative (Western society versus the Venda tribe of South Africa) and a loosely organized philosophical reflection. Ultimately, Blacking presents an indictment of Western culture with relatively rare bibliographic references. The absence of an index or collective bibliography, combined with the restricted assessment, limits the text's use as a convenient or scholarly reference. Nevertheless, it retains value as a time capsule of perspective from a pioneering ethnomusicological researcher. Blacking divides his discussion into four sections: I. Humanly Organized Sound; II. Music and Society and Culture; III. Culture and Society in Music; IV. Soundly Organized Humanity. Throughout, he raises further questions crucial to answering the overriding inquiry. He describes the first three chapters as an attempt to show how research in ethnomusicology may resolve myriad related questions. In the final chapter he endeavors to address why answering the question is essential. Somehow he never quite answers the question satisfactorily.  After an enigmatic opening with what appears to be a feeble attempt at numerologic humor ("Ethnomusicology ... It's seven syllables do not give it any advantage over the pentasyllabic `musicology.'"), Blacking's first chapter positions music as a species-specific sonic phenomenon we are compelled to organize and argues the need to look for patterns and relationships between musical and cultural behaviors. Blacking turns constantly, if monoptically, to his own experiences with the Venda tribe. Blacking goes on to insist the question of man's musicality cannot be answered without first understanding the processes of cause and effect, such as the issue of who performs, sings and listens to music and why. Here he also aptly suggests the social setting may at times even supersede the music in a culture's perception and that it is essential to listen with the appropriate cultural ears. Again he turns largely to the Venda tribe for examples and even provides an illustrated calendar of Venda musical practice and an complicated diagram of musical and social relationships in the Venda society. Ironically, while stepping on and off his societal soapbox, Blacking manages to critique the presumptive arrogance of narrowly focused Western musicologists and condemn the practice of apartheid, but he inherently accepts the Venda tribe's mutilation of women in their annual season of female circumcision. Contradictions abound. The book contains several confusing segues into self-indulgent recollections and intermittent non sequiturs, such as in the ultimate paragraph: "Even falling in love may be more significant as a cognitive activity in which learned categories are realigned, than as an exertion of the sex organs or a hormonal reaction." For a scholarly tome suitable for extended practical shelf life from this author, one might do well to forgo his philosophical prattling for his actual research originally printed in 1967, Venda Children's Songs: A Study in Ethnomusicological Analysis (Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1995) © G. Galvá 
 There isn't anything new to Machen's basic argument: that liberal Christians are not true Christians. Fundamentalists have been saying the same thing for years. Machen simply supplements such black-and-white non-thinking with pseudointellectual arguments.  What Machen really seems to be saying is that because liberal Christians don't agree with conservative and/or fundamentalist theology, or go along with legalism and strict adherence to doctrine, they are not Christians.  There is so much more to Christianity than rules. At least there should be. I think that if God wanted us to strictly follow rules and regulations instead of enter into a personal relationship with Him, He would have created a government structure.   I also don't buy the assertion that we should strictly adhere to traditonal doctrine. There was once a time when the church persecuted scientists for simply suggesting that the sun rotated around the earth! Doctrine has been used in that way for centuries upon centuries to shut people up and force them into conformity.  People should, at least, be allowed to have their own set of beliefs, within reason. I am very uncomfortable with any organization, whether religious or otherwise, forcing its adherents to conform to their doctrine without allowing for any "wiggle room". such situations leave too much room for persecution of those who don't necessarily agree with a point of doctrine.  It's also rather anti-intellectual. Traditional doctrine is not, after all, infallible. Traditional doctrine may say that the world is made of snow. That doesn't mean it's true; it only means that past generations have been horribly wrong with their science.  There are some doctrines to which we all adhere - an example is the deity of Jesus. But many doctrines are open to debate, and they should remain that way.  Finally, I question Machen's assertion that liberal Christians adhere to a separate religion. If a liberal Christian believes in one true God, and that Jesus is His son, and that He died on the cross for the world's sins, and assuming that Machen is correct in his judgment, then to what religion does this hypothetical liberal Christian adhere? I fail to see how having valid questions about hell, or the Bible, or the creation of the world, or other such issues are absolute deal-breakers that indicate that a person is not a True Christian.  It seems that Machen subscribes to a quite narrow definition of Christianity, into which many people won't fit. The Bible is quite clear that everyone - regardless or who they are, what they've done or any other factor - are open to salvation. Surely liberal Christians such as myself apply as well 
 A regular Amazon shopper, I couldn't have been more disapointed when I opened the box to find that this was not the awesome score from Cast Away.  The picture and title are just misleading.  You shouldn't have to read the fine print when buying a CD.  I wouldn't have purchased if I knew this was not the music from Cast Away 
 ... for the bastardization of one of the greatest works in human history. As several of the more intelligent reviewers have noted this is not the Iliad, if you've only read this you havn't read Homer... what you have read is a cheep, simplistic children's version of the Iliad. In other words it's the Homeric equivalent of those "Great Illustrated Classics" that kids read. The only people who could actually like this are the feeble minded high school students, sitting in the back and waiting to get to shop or gym 
 This is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.  The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.  I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.  The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.  Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts 
 Anyone who believes that this book is an authentic portrayal of boxing has never stepped into a ring and has no sense of history or perspective. Mailer hero-worshipped Ali, and could never write anything objective about him. Mailer knew nothing about boxing, other than the sensation of hitting a woman in one of his drunken binges. Mailer went to Africa, and could not write the truth about Zaire or its bloodthirsty dictator. He either did not know or could not write that the stadium in which the fight was held, for example, was a killing field for criminals who were rounded up before the fight to make sure the event went smoothly for the press and the tourists 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 This is the worst textbook that I've ever read. It has totally utterly destroyed my interest in radio frequency circuits. If you do not have a doctorate in this area, then you shouldn't even consider this book. It doesn't explain a lot of stuff and most of the time you become more confused after reading this book. Avoid it like plague 
 I've got to agree with scoobiedo.  The stickers DO NOT STICK in this book.  After spending a good bit of time putting the stickers in the proper place, they were peeling off in no time.  Also, the story is just ok--not that great.  What I thought would be a fun book turned out to be a great disappointment 
 A lot of things left out. Most of the stuff in the book is repeated over and over. SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY 
 I've been like many reviewers a long time fan of this author and have found this latest "Evil" novel to be less then inspiring, or fun to read.   It does read like a textbook as far as the topic of psychic issues.  Our teaching was couched in conversation normally between Rafe and Isabel. We would hit these class lectures normally right in the middle of the murder/mystery portion of the book, and I would just be getting into the meat of the story, and then I would be derailed by "too much information."  This is not to say that I don't care for instuction and added background.  I do, but there is a time when it is just too much.  We unfortunatly hit this wall of information throughout the story.  This was just an okay read.  There was plenty of suspense (who was doing all of the killing and why) but I just felt that the fleshing out of the storyline, as well as character development was not truly priorty while writing the novel.  The relationship between Rafe and Isabel was rather confusing.  She spent most of her time lecturing him on paranormal issues, and less time letting her hair down and being relaxed while she was with him socially.    To be honest I did skim a few pages, but still, I was okay as far as not missing anything important.  This was not her strongest effort and if you are picking Ms. Hooper up for the first time I highly recommend her other earlier reads or even the other two "Evil" reads.  An author can't be on "top" all of the time and we should just remember that she is capable of doing so much better.  I'm really looking forward to her latest series she has started that will still feature Bishop and his team, and hope that she is back on track as the author we love.

 I think it would have been better in print, some of the concepts are hard to follow on tap 
 The title of the book certainly was a great inducement to buy the book.  Thinking that it would be an informed commentary on key elements of Bush's character, I purchased this book and eagerly awaited its arrival.    Starting off well, the author lays out what he purports to be the architecture of a meaningful and detailed analysis.  Then, sadly it degenerates into a self serving diatribe filled with epithets and derogatory terms.    Whether or not you support the President, any credible review of his actions from a psychiatry perspective should at least appear unbiased.  Not the case here.  Mr. Frank quickly descends into child like name calling and remarks that should never come from a professional.  He cites theories from others that indicate it is impossible to accurately apply a diagnosis without lengthy study, then in the next few paragraphs violates that premise by applying the very diagnosis he earlier claimed was impossible.  Finally, (and I have learned my lesson here) the final words of the book are a call for Bush's impeachment.  What that has to do with an unbiased psychological analysis I have no idea.  I now will read the final paragraph from any book Mr. Frank writes to understand his motivation before sharng my hard earned money with him.  Unless you are a closed minded rabid Bush hater, this book will not appeal to you.  If you are of such ilk, just rewards are yours for the reading 
 Of the 7 or so Grisham novels Ive read this one is my least favorite.  It's not a bad story at all but it's just way too long, about 150 pages longer than it needed to be.   It also just lacked credibility in many spots. Grisham is normally quite good at presenting characters and situations that are at least plausible, if not really interesting. Most of his books give the layman some insight into the workings of the law that Ive always thought were fascinating. This book, however, plods along and doesnt bring anything new to his body of work.  The other thing that really got me was the dialogue he wrote for Mark Sway, the 11year old protagonist. He sounds more like a street-wise 30year old, using words like "wonderful" and phrases that have been out of use since the 70's. I think Grisham forgot he was writing the words for a young boy and not one of his more typically older characters.  This isnt a bad book if you just want to escape for a few hours a day but most of his other ones are far more enjoyable 
 You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9.95 on this very site.   I did.  They work great.  Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries.  Ridiculous 
 I purchased this item on 28 Feb 2007 and now it is 30 Mar 2007 and I still have not received the book. 
 I had thoroughly enjoyed all of Frank Peretti's novels, from This Present Darkness to The Visitation, until this one. While the story starts out well, the many scenes of Beck being dragged here and there through the forest by her Sasquatch abductors soon become repetitious and at times downright boring. As for the "science" behind the actual monster in the story, it appeared to me that Peretti was trying to go for a Michael Crichton-type story line, but Peretti doesn't have Crichton's gift for making complex science understandable (and entertaining) to layman readers. Also, if Crichton were writing this story (which of course he wouldn't, since he doesn't expound a Creationist doctrine), he would have concentrated more on the monster and it's creation and the various scientific, social and moral implications of it's creation, rather than spending endless chapters on Beck learning how to appease her captors. As a Christian, I always look forward to the underlying spiritual meaning of Peretti's stories, but with the exception of the rather perfunctory "Darwinism doesn't work" message, I could find no real spiritual values at all, unless you want to count Beck's gaining some self-esteem and losing her stutter. But then, you know that will happen before you finish Chapter One 
 The hypothesis is pretty basic and the book takes a long time to get around to it. Not worth the read. He could have summarized all the good thinking in this book into a fairly short magazine article. In fact, let me summarize it for you and save the time. Evolution doesn't inherently lead to more complex organisms (like humans), scientists just focus on those organisms at the expense of simple ones (like bacteria). There, now you can read something else instead 
 a murder of wonderful tonight!   Eric Clapton is god and should NOT be touched by country artists 
 I really wanted to like this film.  I love the biblical story and had looked forward sharing this film with my catechism class.  Unfortunately, I am not going to show it in class because it's not a good film.    The beginning is very confusing even if you've read the Bible.  The dialogue is weak (why do they choose English accents for so many of the characters?).  I was looking forward to more focus on the great feast Esther prepares for Xerxes following the period of fasting, but was dissapointed.  There's a climatic scene with Esther running to the king, but the ending seems anti-climatic afterward.    I wanted to root for this movie because I know the Bible has a rich treasure trove of dramatic stories to be enjoyed by everyone.  This one unfortunately missed the mark 
 Poor plot, unnecessary ramblings. Potentially interesting drug stories described by a man with a rich vocabulary and nothing else. It didn't keep me interested and I felt like I was dragging my feet everytime I turned a page. I found myself looking for perhaps something deeper and more profound in the book. Instead, I found more stories about mescaline and stupid drug-inpired ramblings 
 I did not enjy this movie and as a jet Li fan I was disapointe 
 I was confused with this workbook from the second I started using it.  I didn't find it helpful in the least 
 Nice photos on most pages, but the author jumps around and goes into topics that I'm not sure anyone will care about. Text is sappy and meaningless most of the time (example:  "Ladders are pure potential  energy: they just stand there waiting for that moment when they feel the  weight on the first rung, then the second, etc. Imagine being a ladder. It  must be what a fireman feels like: a life of expectancy."). You're  better off with the triumvirate of nicely photographed AND written  "rustic lifestyle" books: Cabin Fever; Adirondack Style; Rustic  Style 
 This is probably the worst book I have ever read. Granted the topic can be very vague and confusing at time, the author makes little attempt tp explain adequately the concepts.   Would highly recommend NOT getting this book 
 It's difficult to figure why anybody would bother using a poor 16mm print to transfer to DVD when there must be good 35mm prints out there, but this is another case of showcasing a very poor 16mm print. Otherwise, this is an excellent madcap film, but it doesn't start cooking until the Edgar Kennedy bartender scene, and Kennedy was absolutely masterful. From this scene on, the rest of the film is a romp. There was much luck with the sequences with Jacky the lion, so Sturges must have lived a charmed life. All the performances shine 
 I purchased this movie because I love Chris Cooper as an actor and because the reviews were very positive.  I played the movie yesterday and boy, was I disappointed.  The movie was much too slow and boring. I love mysteries and hate dramas therefore I thought the little personal stories throughout with flashbacks actually detracted from what I thought was going to be a good mystery story.  In the end the mystery is solved with a thud and don't get me started on the quasi Luke & Leia moment at the end.  PLEASE! 
 this book is tiresome to say the least  what is the point?  we should all kill ourselves  then maybe there will be peace  for heaven sakes on the way to getting the sleeping pills  don't anyone have a contrary opinio 
 The editor, Andrew Ross, describes this book as "an expanded edition" of a special issue of the journal "Social Text". Potential readers should be warned however that it is also an expurgated edition, from which Alan  Sokal's celebrated parody of recent socio-cultural jargon has been  suppressed. One understands Professor Ross's chagrin at the cruel and  unusual joke that Professor Sokal practised on him. However, the  unadvertised deletion of Sokal's contribution is a hoax on the buyers of  "Science Wars" who naturally expect to find in it the one item of the  original publication that has received worldwide attention 
 For months, Disney advertised this as a 2-Disc Special Edition DVD. But at the last minute, that second disc mysteriously disappeared. WHY? This is false advertising, and if I had my way, Disney would have a big fat lawsuit on their hands. It's unfair to force people who really want a 2-Disc to pay very expensive import prices to get one from the UK and to those of us who don't own a region-free player. They did this same crap to Alice In Wonderland, but the other way around. UK lost a disc that we have, and Paramount and Fox have done this to US fans of Titanic by dropping the 2-and-4-disc editions in the US, but not in the UK, and giving fans in the US a 3-Disc edition. I don't understand why these movie companies can't be consistent with their international releases and simply make a single version available for all people all over the world.  Unfortunately, I have chosen not to buy this crappy excuse for a "Special Edition" DVD. I do not appreciate being lied to. I still love Disney movies as well as the excellent DVD editions, when Disney actually releases the product they've advertised for months, and I will continue to buy the QUALITY DVD releases, but I do not enjoy false advertisement 
 Although it is true that peoples had contacts through trade, and therefore the sharing of ideas, however megalithic structures on Malta most likely are not connected to the British Isles and vice versa(http://sociologyesoscience.com/index.html).  Instead Christopher Knight and Alan Butler create a new myth: "Like the British Isles and Brittany, Malta and Israel have Megalithic structures scattered across them and the Old Testament gives detailed evidence of how the Canaanite rituals were adopted for king-making. The memory of these prehistoric secrets was transmitted by the remnants of the Order of the Knights Templar who took their rituals to Scotland at the beginning of the 14th century. 
 For some great advice email me at humorgirl86@hotmail.com. I have owned a cockatiel for 8 years and have alot of expierience. This book is informative on housing, feeding, breeding and healing. It has great  pictures but, it's not the pictures that make the book it's the words! It  doesn't go into great detail about everything. It hardly has a page on  training and that doesn't even help if at all. Sure it may seem good but  once you read it, it really isn't that good at all. I say that you should  go to the pet store or book store and actually read the book or scan it to  make sure that it has what you want. Petsmart and Petco are great pet  stores that have plenty of books and all the needs for a cockatiel 
 I bought this item for the warmth. The heat level is so low that I never can tell when the heat is on.  As for the massage, it's about what I expected - no good at all.  Overall, I would say this item is worthless.  
 "The Romantic" sadly, is not. The one star is for Marketing. After repeated requests to unsubscribe from his newsletter (using the instructions on his website and sending him several email requests), the only response I get is "follow the instructions" The book is already is the trash. 
 Don't recognize the names of any of these DJ's?    For good reason; their talent is non-existant 
 This is a book about Emotional Intelligence which does not consider the reader's emotions. It's very insipid and lacks the depth. If you have already read the Emotional Intelligence by the same author, I wouldn't suggest this book 
 What a huge disappointment and waste of money!  Janet Evanovich should be ashamed of herself, and I'll know not to buy any book by the co-author, Leanne Banks.  The 2 primary characters fell in love way too fast and for no good reason.  The only reason this rates even 1 star is because there was some mildly amusing dialog here and there.  "Pugg" should have been named "Pigg" because he was a disgusting pig and not at all likeable.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!  I can't say it enough 
 I was very disappointed by the book.I wanted an explanation for Israels continuing occupation of Palestinian lands but got only apologistic rhetoric from this obvious pro zionist.Much of his writing I thought quite racist and certainly biased 
 I'm a Pagan who, to put it very mildly, does not have a high opinion of the Old Testament.  But Thompson has managed to write something even worse.  It is one thing to point out that Biblical stories of the Exodus and the conquest of Israel by Joshua are contradicted by archaeological evidence (they are).  It is quite another to throw out genuine archaeological evidence as well as any connections to Biblical stories from the Book of Judges onwards, as though neither people nor history existed back then!    If folks want to say that there were ancient Israelites back in the 13th century BC, and have some evidence for it (including, say, Merneptah's Stele, which appears to refer to them explicitly), then right or wrong, that's scholarship.  If others want to say that the actual Israelites did not appear until the 12th or 11th century BC, and present some evidence for that (including explaining the Stele, of course), well, that's scholarship as well.  I'd refer interested readers to works such as "The First Historians" by Baruch Halpern (1988), "The Archaeology of the Land of Israel" by Yohanan Aharoni (1978) and "Who Were the Israelites and Where Did They Come From?" by William Dever (2003).  Thompson, however, is an anti-scholar.  He knows that people existed from the 13th through the 3rd centuries BC.  He knows there's enormous amounts of corroborating evidence about what those people were like.  And he's out to denounce anyone who says anything about them, no matter what they say!  It's simply ridiculous.    The claim that there were no such people as the ancient Israelites is not scholarly unless it is backed up by some rather striking evidence.  Thompson has nothing of the sort.    This guy is worse than the Bible-is-truth fundamentalists.  At least, those who believe the accounts in the Old Testament will get some of the later history right, once in a while.  Thompson, by denying that there is any truth anywhere, won't get anything right 
 I was very excited about the series of books being written focusing on Clerics of FR, however my enthusiasm was effectively terminated after reading this first installment. This is quite possibly one of the worst-written books I've ever read. Apart from the numerous grammatical errors, the book is written like one of the adventures the author usually designs. The characters are fairly original, but the story focuses not on the cleric of Talona as the title would suggest, but on the party sent to destroy him. Overall, a disappointing story that I found very hard to enjoy 
 book was one that i wanted, but because of an error at the printers, many pages were missing 
 These glasses should not have the Bushnell name on them, which misleads one to think they are good quality. I bought them for my son, and by the time I got around to sending them, I discovered that the plastic housing was cracked where the front lens screws in, so the lens was misaligned. It was past the 30-day return date, so I glued the crack and kept them for my own use. They are still not right, but I keep them in my car for occasional use. My advice -- spend some extra money and get a good pair. 
 I bought this item because other comforters from this seller had good reviews, but it was a complete mistake!  It really was dingy like described by other reviewer.  I returned it, but lost over twenty five dollars in back and forth shipping costs for this item.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AGAINST THIS PRODUCT OR SELLER 
 I bought this to replace my broken Digital8 Sony camcorder and the same sales guy who sold me the Sony 6 years ago advised me to buy this JVC, on one single criterion: the near-infinite hard disk drive storage. This was almost the only claim that was actually fulfilled.  Summary: infinite recording time, disappointing image quality and control for the price, painful editing. Not for the average iMovie user.  Positive points: - the storage capacity: a dream. I thought that 7 hours of high-quality video would barely last two weeks of vacation. Actually it took me months to fill them. Mostly because, as with digital cameras, you can throw away all the bad takes at will. I decided I'd keep all my previous good takes until I really would need the space, well... I still have my best clips from 5 months ago in the camcorder, which means that I can always show them at friends and family on location, even if I don't have my computer or DVD copies on me. - the size, weight and shape: perfect. You can take this camcorder anywhere without facing hard packing decisions. It's small, feels rather rugged. I added a wide-angle lens and the bigger optional battery, which makes the camera 50% bulkier but still manageable. The shape is great, at least for my hand size. I can really grab the camera properly in various situations of verticality and bumpiness... The microphones are not that well placed though, and I often cover them with my fingers. - image stabilization: very good. By chance I shot a clip with my wide-angle lens in the way, which gave me a good fixed reference to see how the beast is fast and smooth at correcting unwanted shakiness. - ease of connection: the USB2 link is OK. I'd have preferred firewire, but here we are not dealing with video streams but video files. BTW, this allows faster-than-real-time transfer. A firewire link with the camcorder acting as a hard disk would have been great...  OK points: user interface, reaction time (even if it takes a long time to get ready), optics, battery life (with the 3 hour batt. - actually a 1.5 hours).  Negative points : - Image quality: considering the price, image quality is disappointing. Frankly. The viewfinder is flattering but color saturation is in fact low, and clips shot on sunny days seem sadder than they are as I found out after shooting for a whole week in Yucatan. Clips shot on my digital camera (Canon IXUS 60)  look better. There is also a lack of control on image quality. - Digital camera: simply forget it. My phone takes better pictures. I'd advise you to buy a 2Mpix+ cellphone and enjoy the benefit of sending your pics and videos immediately to far-away family and pals. - File transfer and editing: pretty horrible with the originally supplied software. In marketing copy, MPEG2 files might seem nice as a target format, but we always have to edit our videos, and this is quite painful, whatever power-users might tell you. You are in for hours of conversion, except if you burn your raw takes, at the risk of boring your audience.  I was going to write "don't buy this if you are a Mac user". This is NOT iMovie ready. I have both PCs and Macs, it's equally painful and disappointing, except if you buy yourself a real video editing suite.  Still, if you have a Mac and an Everio get yourself the wonderful MPEG Streamclip free utility from Squared 5. It allows batch conversion of the Everio .MOD files into useable formats. You'll have to buy the MPEG2 component from Apple first and change the .MOD extensions to .MPG prior to conversions. Time- and disk-space-consuming but worth it, as the image quality is superior to the one generated by the JVC-supplied software.  Neat thing: leave your computer at home Though you can't use the camcorder as an external hard disk (it is write-protected) you can copy the photographs from the SD card to the hard-disk, which means that with the Everio, you wont need to bring your computer on a trip just to store the pictures from your digital camera.  Conclusion: given the choice, I won't buy this camcorder, mainly for the below-par image quality, as I'm ready to cope with the complications of conversion and editing. But I'd seriously miss the storage capacity 
 I got this DVD for $1.99 and I still feel ripped off.  The quality of the movie was terrible, the story line was stupid, and the acting was just fair.  Do not waste your time on this poor movie.  Even though there are some stars in it in their younger days (Eloitt Gould, Michelle Piefer, David Caruso), it does not make up for the poor content of the movie.  Cheaply made---DON'T BOTHER!! 
 First of all, this review is based on what I got out of this graphic novel.  I may be very dense and can't understand subtle humor of this nature.  I found several parts of this humorous, but most of the time I was confused and lost in the story and where it was going and why it was going that route.  Maybe it wasn't supposed to make sense and I just didn't get it.  It any case, the art was, to say the least, incredible and visceral.  I would definitely get another penned by this artist.  But the story left me confused and somewhat disturbed 
 WHAT A LOUSY MOVIE! AND I READ NOTHING BUT GLOWING REVIEWS ABOUT THIS CONVOLUTED PIECE OF BAD ACTING, BAD STORIED MOVIE. PLEASSSEEE, SAVE YOUR MONEY THIS IS A BAD MOVIE, BORING AND ALL-AND-ALL A LOUSY STORY. I DON'T RECOMMEND IT 
 A cool lady I call the Rockchick loaned me this ep; I listened. Man, o, man, this stuff could put trees to sleep.  I told the Rockchick that it sounded like these guys were serenading angels and not people that live on earth.  If you're 15-19 and still have all your hopes and dreams about meeting mr. or ms.right-- get this syrupy ep.   Otherwise, listen to Kasabian or the Dandy Warhols...music that rocks even as it moves all over the place spilling cheer and sonic radiation 
 Reviewer Shalom Freedman lists a series of major differences between the Israeli government and various U.S. administrations.  The fact that they occurred is undeniable.  Many more could be added.  For example, both the Truman and Eisenhower Adminsitrations refused to sell any weapons to Israel, not even those of a defensive nature.  Jimmy Carter was certainly no friend of Israel and pressured Israel into giving up all of Sinai.  (As the winner of a war it did not seek, Israel had every right to keep it or at least part of it.)  Bill Clinton interfered in Israel's internal electoral process in favor of the Labor Party and in opposition to the Likud party.   What is incredible is that the vast majority of readers found Friedman's review to be of no value.  That so many people do not wish to be confused with the facts is rather scary.  
 The songs selected for this collection are great, rousing classics, but the producers of the CD series decided to overdub stadium crowd noise over most of the songs, completely ruining the original songs!!!  Don't buy this if you want the pure songs in their original state.. 
 After reading his last few book with "co-authors" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the "co-author". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves 
 My seat is BRAND NEW and I love it, but it has already quick working. I've changed the batteries reapeatedly and it still only works occassionaly. It won't vibrate at all and the music only plays sometimes. VERY DISAPPOINTED. 
 The first PMDVR8 I owned worked extremely well for about 2 years.  After it began to fail, I purchased 2 more.  One of the two never worked consistently and failed completely in about a month.  The other failed in about 4 months of light use.  Even inexpensive remotes should last longer 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
 It's a common belief that John Woo lost his way when he moved to Hollywood, but in truth his career was always highly erratic even in his Hong Kong days. For every Better Tomorrow or The Killer on his resume there's at least one disappointment on the level of Bullet in the head.  On paper Bullet in the Head looks like John Woo's most ambitious and under-rated film, but sadly it turns out to be an entirely derivative and largely ineffective shoot-em-up that blows its few good ideas in all the overkill. There's the germ of a good idea in its sprawling tale of three friends who skip the rioting Hong Kong of 1967 to make their fortune in the chaos of Vietnam, but it's quickly lost amid the cartoon carnage - this is the kind of film where Woo will add a bomb disposal man having his arms blown off to the background of a romantic parting, and that's one of the more subtle scenes. Clunking construction and wild leaps of logic abound (it's hard to take Jacky Cheung's cries of "Don't make me commit murder!" seriously after we've just seen him gun down thirty people) and the tragedy of Vietnam is reduced to the level of a video game in several over the top and largely uninvolving action scenes.   There are a few mildly effective moments, such as Simon Yam's memorable introduction, but the lasting impression is of a hack who has seen The Deer Hunter and The Killing Fields several times without ever really understanding them. Horrendously disappointing. No misjudged underappreciated lost masterpiece, just a mess 
 I admit it.  I only bought this movie for one reason: the lovely Phoebe Cates is topless in much of the movie.  (Okay, so make that two reasons.)  On this point, I was not disappointed.  That said, I made the mistake of trying to watch this turkey of a movie from beginning to end.  I believe the makers of this movie were confused about who their target audience is.    On one hand, the film contains a lot of nudity and sex.  On the other, the film features dumbed-down, bad dialogue and patently groan-worthy attempts at humor, the kind of humor that only 5 year old children would find amusing.  Really, the scenes with the monkeys were as childish as they were totally out-of-place in a softcore porn flick 
 This book is way overated.  Its way-out, wacky treament of electronics could definitely not be that of any well thought-of engineer.  It's frankly just a bunch of goofy unsystematic mumbo-jumbo by some over-educated self-proclaimed "physicists."   So imagine my surprise when I read a translation of this in Russian.  I think the whole world must have been duped.  Do yourself a favor.  Go read the Smith book (see my other reviews) and avoid this one like the plague 
 To me, "'74 Jailbreak" was nothing but AC/DC's temporarily relief for upset fans who, after spending their hard earned money on the non Australian editions of "HIGH VOLTAGE" and "DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP", discovered that they were not getting the whole picture. However, "'74 Jailbreak" is not very much of a relief. This rather skimpy "retrospective" is just a 5 song EP. It features 1 song from the Aussie version of "DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP" ("Jailbreak") and 4 songs from Aussie version of "HIGH VOLTAGE" ("You ain't got a hold on me"; "Showbusiness"; "Soul stripper" and "Baby please don't go"). After some thorough research, I found out that at least 12 additional tracks could have been part of this release, including a version of Chuck Berry's "School Days", only available in Down Under until it appeared in 1997's "BONFIRE", another purely commercial product. And, apparently, there are still more goodies sadly gathering dust in vaults.  A final word about this re-issue: I don't own it. In the words of Pete Townshend, I "won't get fooled again". I rest my case 
 This item was fun for my daughter to build with her grandpa, but after it was built the fun was over. It doesn't do much except sit on the shelf and take up space. I told her to take it apart again and redo it. That might be fun once, but after that it will probably go to the Thrift Shop 
 A slow-moving, pretentious novel.  The main character is arrogant and unbearable.  Throughout the entire book, my feeling was who cares?  And, to the author, just tell me your message.  It could have been said in one sentence.  I don't need a boring story to get your point. 
 I read 3 books on this subject, and this was my least favorite out of all three.  I found it a bit negative and reading it almost made me more focused on the negative aspects of infertility.  The information was good, but not as good and not as easy to navigate as other books I've read.  
 Having read "The Millionaire Next Door," as well as most if not all of the classics in this category, I expected life-altering experiences with this book.  There were too many statistics, and statistics that contradicted one another, not to mention generalizations about various subgroups that, try as I did, I had to put my copy down and use it at first for a door stop, then because the cover art is great, I decided leaving it on the coffee table makes a great conversation piece.  
 I've read many books of this genre, and this is so far the one I dislike the most. I'm not saying the author is a bad writer, she is very good at telling stories and sounds like a nice person. However, this book has very few accounts of real haunts. She considers dreams as real accounts or out-of-body experiences, which in my opinion are still just dreams. From the beginning it felt like she was expecting to find ghosts from day one and most of her perception seem like she truly wants to see something happen, like she's trying too hard. Also, she just assumes, also from day one, that the house is haunted by the last owner who just died. It seems like wishful thinking to me, I mean, it's an old house, it's bound be have many deaths in its history, and one can get really imaginative living in it.   I believe and like to read about the supernatural, but this book didn't convince me one bit 
 I want to preface my review by saying I consider myself to be pretty open minded, and when I read some of the other bad reviews before getting this book I thought to myself these people need to lighten up.  I have now read the book and am ready to admit I was wrong.    I read it, and I thought it was funny, but if this were going to be a tool to help teach my son about sex I could take him to a public bathroom and show him the drawings on the walls for free.  My goal is to start talking to my son about sex early, honestly, and using the correct names for body parts; to teach him that his body and sex are natural and beautiful; rather than a dirty secret to make vulgar jokes about.  This book does nothing to help me.  The premise of this book is that the two children teach the parents the facts of life, so if you would like to have a nine or ten year old teach your child the facts of life this is the book for you. If you would rather an adult explain it in a way a child can understand there are many other wonderful books out there, keep looking 
 I purchased this movie with Amazon unbox.  I downloaded it to my high def series 3 Tivo.  It was very disappointing.  The picture was little on my high def screen.  It is a letter boxed standard def program which looks very very small on a high def screen.  I even tried changing the aspect on my television.  No improvement.  Come on Amazon, you know what type of Tivo I have, Tivo knows what type of television I have, let's produce something that is at least watchable on every setup 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 I had written a long review on this novel, but appearantly it vanished.  When I started this, I thought it had an interesting if a bit familiar premise, but as I read I found a seriously flawed romantic thriller with some BIG PLOT HOLES.  Basically, you have a spunky heroine with a heart problem who trys to get away from her pathologically overprotective family after the death of her beloved Grandmother.  She runs into the Lone Ranger..I mean Jake "Tin Man" Dolan.  Jake Dolan has major trust issues and is written like a third-rate Jean Claud Van Damme role.  These two are convineatly sexually attracted to each other almost immediately, but his issues prevent them from getting together.  Then the Cannon Fodder baddies come, and they start to connect.  Dolan tries to be noble, and sends her away,  but of course she cannot stay away thus setting up a predictable climax, and afterwards, Dolan manages to lose my respect as he lets the heroine's brothers dictate their sister's life.  Don't waste your money on this book 
 This is a very comprehensive book about the general subject of raising bilingual children, based on a number of case studies. I am sure that therefore it would be of great use to anyone studying a linguistic subject in this realm.   However as a handbook for parents who want to raise a bilingual child it hardly offers any advise. I have a different native tongue than my wife, who's native language is English. Living in an English speaking country I would like my daughter to learn my (foreign) native language too. What I was looking for is a book with tips and ideas, such as word games, books, etc. to bring a second language playfully and naturally into a toddler's life.   If you are looking for such a book too, this is not the one. Although the book may be good for a linguistics student I have to give it a low rating because of its misleading title 
 This is one of those books that sound too good to be true, and  is too good to be true.  The cover makes promises the  context can't keep.  There's a seven day "prequel" of very restircted eating, the "one day detox" of just juice, and a three day sequel of very restricted eating, all to be followed with serious dietary changes for life.  If it was easy for people to eat like this they would already be doing it and they wouldn't need this book.  There's a lot of good nutritional information here (although she said vinegar makes you acidic, when, even though it is acidic, it makes you alkaline when metabolized, which is what you want if yu want to be healthy).  Bottom line is, if you need to lose 10 lbs quickly, can stick to a tough regimine for 10 days, and don't mind gaining the weight back when you go back to your regular eating habits, this book is for you 
 I don't like propaganda. Take a look at Jerry Z. Muller's The Mind and the Market: Capitalism in Modern European Thought. It is apolitical, richly textured, tightly organized, and packed with ideas. If you are looking for the antecedents of the Industrial Revolution, read Maxine Berg's The Age of Manufactures 1700-1820 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 "Julia's Last Hope" is a typical Janette Oke book, but I felt that it fell short of her other books.  I always turn to Oke's books when I need a book to read quickly, and this is the case with this one.  While it's light and easy to read, I didn't feel it provoke any emotions within me, like her stories usually do.  I thought the plot to be rather redundant, and I was waiting for something to happen - and nothing ever did.  I do not recommend 
 To give context to my comments, I have a degree in Middle East History and bought this book, first edition, in 1992.  I began it several times over the years, only to be defeated by the dry prose and ceaseless repetition of unrelated facts.  I finally sat down to read it from start to finish a few months ago.  Now that I've finally finished, I realize that I wish I had never made the attempt.  It is boring, but worse than that, it is deceptive.  All references come for the first edition, hardback.  1. p. 191, Regarding domed buildings, "the transition from the square hall to the round dome posed a problem which was solved by the use of the squinch or pendentive, often with stalacites for decoration."  This quote gives the false impression the Arabs solved the problem of placing a dome on a square hall.  Google "Haggia Sophia" and you will see a dome sitting on a square hall built by Eastern Roman Christians in the 500s.  2.  Constantly discusses communist Arabs in a neutral to positive light (p. 325) but fails to mention the presence of fascist influences in Arab politics, especially the roots of fascism in the Ba'ath Party as a result of Arabism's fascination with 1930s European power politics.  3. p. 359, Regarding the move by the surrounding Arab communities to crush the newly created Israel, Arab "forces moved into the mainly Arab parts of the country."  Hourani then claims fighting broke out because the absence of borders allowed Jews "to occupy the greater part of the country."  This is a deliberate falsification on Hourani's part.  The Arab forces publicly stated aims was the destruction of Israel and the removal of the Jewish community from Palestine.  4.  p. 368, Regarding the resolution of the 1956 Suez Canal Conflict, "Under American and Soviet pressure . . . the three forces withdrew."  Here Hourani implies, falsely, that France, Britain and Israel were affected equally by U.S. and Soviet threats.  In fact, the U.S. Sixth Fleet shielded the three combatant forces from the irrelevant Soviet forces, while acting to pressure the combatants to withdraw.  Even more, Eisenhower's use of economic retaliation against the weak French and British economies did most of the work.  5.  p. 413, In one of the most egregious passages, blames Israel for a war of aggression against the peaceful Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the Six Days War.  I recommend the book, aptly titled, Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East to dispel any misunderstandings fostered by Hourani.  6.  Even when writing honestly, Hourani tends towards dry, and needless, repetition.  By way of example are his nearly indistinguishable passages on Arab poetry on pages 12-14, 49-51, 87, 153, 187, 193-195, 239, 305, 340, 395-397, which could be summarized as "Poetry, both oral and written, is the greatest achievement of Arab culture.  Even today it retains many of the same themes and similar structures to that created in pre-Islamic times."  Except Hourani takes 18 pages over the course of the book to say it.  In conclusion, I can not recommend this book for either the beginner or specialist.  The beginner will be overwhelmed by the flood of unexplained names, dates, facts and figures.  The specialist will constantly find problems with Hourani's accuracy and honesty.  There are too many good books on both Arab and Islamic history for you to waste your time on this one 
 I had high hopes for this, expecting a bigger dose of Maureen's refreshing liberal arguments and interesting points.  No such luck.  It's hard to start the analysis considering how she jumps from point to point throughout the book and throughout each chapter.  You'd think the title might give it focus, but that very question doesn't even come up until the mid-point of the book (about where I am now; not sure I have the will to finish), and her wittest method of answering it is some cutesy tangent about genetics and how sperm is no longer necessary to fertilize eggs.  harharhar.  Up until that point, it's mostly a collection of random rants and anecdotes about how men supposedly can't handle women who are smarter than them or make more money, etc.  Also, that all these societal standards are the fault of men, completely omitting women's responsibility in upholding them.  (Get a clue: women are at least as insistent on the man being richer or more powerful no matter her standing, just like women expect the man to be taller no matter her height.)  If Maureen truly believes men desire ditzes, maybe she can find comfort in knowing the release of this book just increased her compatibility 
 This movie is such a waste of your life. The plot is horrible, the characters are horrible, this MOVIE IS HORRIBLE! It makes no sense whatsoever and it's a sucky fairytale. I really can't understand who thought it was funny! Maybe if the plot would be way different, it might be okay, but the writers failed. Once again, I HATED IT! 
 As a counseling psychologist, I read this book hoping to better understand the nature of this issue. I think Dr. Forward has a greal deal of experience and knowledge about the subject, and there are some helpful sections in her book. I feel, however, that the tone and way in which she delivers her information comes across as self-promoting, at best, and is presumptious and harmful, at worst. Through the vignettes and therapeutic dialogues, Dr. Forward paints herself as an expert who knows what people should think, react, and behave regarding this matter. I am concerned for the general public because Dr. Forward is so absolute and dogmatic about how people should approach this situation and "heal." At no point in her book does she qualify her statements or advice, which I feel should have been addressed. While the advice in the book may help many people, I would like readers to know that she does not take into account cultural, ethnic/racial, social, economic, or other personal differences that could influence how you perceive, respond, and relate to "toxic parents." 
 This book is not for filmgoers. Its focus is geared to the elite and erudite college student who will be impressed by name dropping of prominent philosophers in Western Lit. To be polite, it is dripping in stream-of-consciousness commentary that wreaks of self-indulgence, suggesting adult attention deficit problems. It is not uncommon to find sentences in excess of 50 words long, that if grammatically diagrammed would make Watson and Crick's double helix look like a straight arrow. Save time and save money. The clip art of movie scenes is primitive and should have been a clue as to the author's intent. A great disappointment 
 Clive Cussler made his reputation writing books with plots that are barely believable using characters that are totally unbelievable saving the world over and over again from his perch in an unknown but extremely powerful U.S. government agency. After many successful books, Clive perfected the formula and is now sharing it with Paul Kemprecos who co-writes an analogous series which uses the same agency, plots, and characters. Oh, this series does change some things, the main character is Kurt not Dirk and his sidekick is Mexican and not Italian. Also, there is a second pack of characters (Paul and Gamay Trout) who allow the plot to develop through a second set of eyes.  None of which takes away from the formulaic tone of this series and this book in particular. In typical fashion, the first chapter is a historical look that "sets the stage." In this case it is an aerial combat over the Alps in 1914 between an industrialist and six (6!!) combat pilots. Needless to say, the industrialist holds his own and manages to down four of his foes before he himself is shot down and killed. The next chapter comes to the present time and takes off a second thread - this time it is a "survivor"-type of reality show which is interrupted by an attack of some mutated beings. The third chapter starts pulling all these disparate threads together and off we go.  Unfortunately, this book is too formulaic. It does not take the reader long to realize who the threat is, nor does it take us long to see the connections between the various threads. The only real complication is a completely preposterous connection between the bad guy's attempt to take over the world and an infestation of some new kind of sea weed that tries to take over the oceans.  As is usual in these novels, there are high speed car chases, underwater action, aerial acrobatics (in world war 1 vintage planes no less!), underwater escapades and explosion galore. throughout them all, the hero gets a bit bruised but the thugs all manage to get killed (Even though they are supposedly highly trained special forces types) and the world is rescued by the effort of one man - Kurt Austin. There is a love interest (why a different one in each book? Doesn't he ever get to enjoy some time with his rescued conquest?) who is French, and side visits to Scotland and Massachusetts.  The only unique thing about this book was that it was the first time that I was exposed to the "Premium" format which is a slightly longer/taller book with more space between the lines. The book cover states that this format is "Specially designed for comfortable reading" but I cannot say that it improved things for me that much.  To summarize, as a Clive Cussler fan, I had to read this book to make sure I keep up with the adventures, but this one is not in the top two-thirds of his efforts. I am sure that Kurt Austin will reappear soon and hope that the next one will be more interesting and fun to read 
 i used to be a rather large 311 fan due mainly to the comparisons to sublime. they are pretty good in my book but i must say, this cd is a weak compilation...one has to understand..each of the albums represents a different 311 universe. being reduced to 2-4 songs off of each album mushed together on one gets old very fast.  start out with transistor or soundsystem if your into reggae-ish sounds..if your into rap rock..go with grassroots and blue album. this cd is a rip off and a cheapened 311 experience 
 A disappointing book about a fabulous story.  The book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and, if you look at the chapter notes, this appears to be how it was researched.  There are little irritants, such as referring to Steve Jobs as "Steve" as if he's a close friend, but the big problem is that it recounts a number of interesting incidents in Steve Jobs' career while missing the main story.  And what a fantastic story that is.  I hope that someone has written a decent account of Steve Jobs' life because I would like to read it.    One thing is certain: "iCon" sure ain't it. 
 . Thomas Penham searches throughout the novel, for his grandfather's amazing collection of pornography, for the girl of his dreams, for the code word bluebells, finally for his place in the world.  From explosions to bodily functions, dissolving marriages to World War I, Robinson has it all in this novel, yet there is a huge problem; I never once cared for any of these characters. From the dying grandfather to Thomas himself, a fairly repulsive twerp whom Robinson tries to save by giving him the soul of a poet, there was not one character here who brought about any kind of emotional response and reading about characters you don't care about is always a chore 
 First off, let me say that I know next to nothing about art.  I would like to cultivate an appreciation for great artwork, but it certainly does not come naturally - especially when it comes to modern art.  Dali, however, is a master I at least have some affinity with.  Who doesn't know of the melting clocks?  I have also seen the dream sequence he created for Hitchcock's film Spellbound in 1945.  Plus, the guy was just plain weird, and that is something I know a little bit about myself.  This Artists of the 20th Century DVD looks solely at Dali's artwork.  All you see throughout the 50 minutes of video is one piece after another.  There is no biographical look at the man, no mention of his contributions to the world beyond his paintings, and certainly no commentary on his eccentric personality (or mustache).  There is not even an adequate identification of Gala, his inspiration and muse, despite numerous references to her in his paintings.  Thus, this DVD will not introduce you to Dali the man or Dali the artist - it only looks at selected pieces of the art work of the maestro.  Dali's artwork is obviously impressive, and I was surprised by the variety of his work and styles.  The narrator offers insight into some paintings - others, you just look and advance.  I don't understand a lot of Dali's work, nor can I see some of the things the narrator tells me are in his more abstract pieces.  The melting clocks and other surrealist images appeal to me.  Dark works such as Visage of War speak volumes to the human observer, and the disappearing bust of Voltaire paintings are also striking.   I was most impressed by the small sample of classical pieces Dali painted, however - largely because I did not know he ever produced such works.  My idea of a painting equates with something like Design for the Interior Decoration of a Stable-Library, which is a strikingly beautiful work.  Is this DVD worth watching?  I will have to say No.  If you're a know-nothing novice like me, there is not enough basic information provided to really illuminate the artwork you will be shown.  If you're knowledgeable about Dali, you'll be disappointed by the limited nature of the production and by the exquisite Dali works excluded from the show.  After watching this, I decided to peruse some Dali galleries online, and I must say that the Internet makes this DVD of little value.  Not only are the analyses and critical comments you will find online far superior to the information provided in this video, the quality of the paintings themselves are far better online than they are on the DVD 
 I've been a huge fan of the Isleys for over 30 years, and stuck by them through the early Motown soul and their golden groove-funk period of the 1970s, through to the later stuff right up to the excellent Mission To Please album. But that's when they should have dumped R. Kelly, because it's the last album that had any really decent hook to it. And when you have a blistering guitarist like Ernie Isley, why bury him so far in the mix that his licks sound like they're being played through cotton wool?    R. Kelly's plodding grooves just grind from one indistinguishable track to another, which is pretty much the case on the even more disappointing follow-up to this, Body Kiss. The only track that kicks any ass here is the opener, Move Your Body, which fools you into thinking this might be a return to former glories for our heroes. Sadly, the leaden funk of R. Kelly then comes crashing in like a tidal wave of sludge and we get a whole turgid mess of leaden walking-pace 'grooves' that might sound all right in the background when you're getting it on with the partner of your dreams, but as listening music just gets you all exasperated and reaching for the 3+3 album again.    Come on, Isleys, dump the Kelly glop and get back to what you can do best 
 I haven't enjoyed the boom box because the antenna couldn't find a signal, after moving it to every possible south facing setting, to send to the boom box. I used this xm receiver in one of my trucks and it worked fine. not the case with the indoor set-up. 
 An anguished, twentysomething filmmaker, mourning the loss of his wife, leaves L.A. to find himself.  Or something.    So he travels to his hometown of San Francisco, where he reconnects with old friends and enemies.  There he remains true to himself while he wryly observes all the phonies and neurotics, finally meeting a deep and sincere woman with whom he can begin to heal over the loss of his wife.  This is a typical indie film, in the sense that its satirical targets are all so old.  Phony literary parties with their pretentious poetry readings (one scene bears a striking resemblance to the literary party in Parker Posey's THE DAYTRIPPERS); shallow artsy types; crude Hollywood studio suits (shades of SWIMMING WITH SHARKS or THE BIG PICTURE, take your pick).  Indeed, the whole trip north to San Francisco evokes SIDEWAYS (although this film predates SIDEWAYS).  However, this film in no way matches the quality of THE DAYTRIPPERS or SIDEWAYS or even THE BIG PICTURE.  Many quirky scenes, but the characters aren't engaging enough.  That, plus the sense that we've seen all these character types and their situations many times before, makes for a rather boring experience.  There are a few strong scenes.  The opening with the studio executive is funny .  Even so, the executive, and especially the agent, are very broadly drawn caricatures, which is not true of all the characters, giving this film an uneven feel.  What's worse, this film meanders, like SIDEWAYS, but it doesn't meander anyplace especially interesting.  So I was bored.  Vanessa Marcil's scenes as the dead wife were poignant (I wish she did more film work), but her scenes are brief, hardly enough to save this film 
 In my opinion this book is mostly circular advice. It's like coaching a basketball player on foul shooting and telling him little more than "make the shot."  There is a useful checklist on page 52.  I think the Falk and Fajans book is a better purchase. I recommend reading this book in your law school's library. I'm not sure why you would need your own copy 
 This book has good writtings by some of the master's of Okinawan. I bought it thinking it was a continuation of Taira Sensei work (Espically since his photo is on the cover). This book is for those that are interested in all  aspects of Okinawan history 
 I ususally like Deepak Chopra but this time he really let me down.  He is just another one trying to make a buck praying on people who a desperate to find a solution to rind those extra kilos 
 Although the book presents itself as a grammar guide, it actually only contains pages of mostly worthless rules on the gender of nouns. If you want excercises or to actually learn grammar, then don't buy this book. I would recommend "501 German Verbs" 
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.

 I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT. (... 
 I am a big fan of the pretender series and I just wanted to share my disappointment's on season 4 where it's an ending of a comedy season and not a fun season that we've seen in first 3 seasons. I believe they ran out of ideas and they just wanted to fill in the blanks and put any crap. I was really disappointed. :( I recommend no one to buy it, not to mention it's pretty expensive as it is. 
 Badly written book 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 I guess I expected more out of this movie but I confess I was mildly disappointed in it. At first, the movie seems to be having a hard time making up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama and the resulting mish mash is a bit unsettling. Still, it was a great cast; Dean Martin was particularly adept at westerns, much more so than Frank Sinatra, who pretty much plays Frank Sinatra in this one. It is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies, in this case, Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress. The bad guys are well represented by Victor Buono and Charles Bronson. A fun movie but not particularly memorable.  
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 I was truely craving Korean food and want to learn to make it. Well, i have to say, the book has too exquisite of food in it. Not traditional food you will find at most restaurants or even in the open market. And what's up with it being written in a language other than Korean???  I speak English but also know some Korean and am very disappointed with the fact that it isn't even written in Korean........ 
 Read all of Chuck's other books and this is the worst of the bunch.  SD&CP was funny.  This is just a bad collection of articles that he has written.  If you want to read about femal cover bands, or the scene in Fargo ND when he was 23, go right ahead.  It feels like you are reading the Village Voice cover to cover...one crappy article at a time.  Torture 
 The book would probably be informative to some people.  Overall, I didn't learn a single thing.  THE BOTTOM LINE:  If you don't know anything about hair and skin care, if you are starting from scratch, then this book might be helpful. If you are like me, and you already read Essence or already have some knowledge of how and when to wash your hair and face, then the book will seem like a waste of money.   Another drawback --most of the advice is incredibly general.   A woman of color with skin or hair problems would be better advised to make an appointment with Dr. Taylor or another black dermatologist to get specific advice to help your specific problems. If you have health insurance, one appointment with a dermatologist should not cost to much more than the book. 
 This was one of five books that I brought from Amazon.com and by far the worst of the lot.  This man has one idea about how the government really works.  Take it from me I have been with the IRS for five years 
 I thought I detected some deterioration in the quality of Discover Magazine in recent months, so I went to the web to see if anyone else had the same notion. Indeed they have. Sad.    
 This has got to be one of the most worthless rune books ever printed.  If you really want to study the runes get Runelore by Edred Thorson or Northern Mysteries by Freya Aswin 
 I ordered their leather fanny pack in the rainbow color combination.  What came bears no relationship to any rainbow I have ever seen!   It is red, brown, black and cream. Also beware the return policy, it is minus the orginal shipping!  Plus a $4.95 restocking charge. Plus your own cost of return shipping. Amazing!  This is the worst deal I have every experienced at Amazon!    Do not buy from this company 
 Talentless people and garbage music  torture you in this turkey-in no time flat,you'll be driven to pure insanity as you run screaming "MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" out into the yard.Do not spend money on this product unless you want to wind up beating your head against the wall and babbling nonsense 
 In today's pace driven world, I was looking forward to a little respite in James Ogilvy's book.  Unfortunetely, it didn't deliver for me.  What  suggests to be a guide to finding creativity and fulfillment, ends up being  nothing more than the author's sterile philosophical rantings.  Actually, I  don't know how it ended since I only made it through half the book.  I  would have liked less history and more "evidence" or anecdotes  from the author's life that promote this way of living.  Ogilvy wants to  sell us on "goallessness", but doesn't offer any kind of  convincing argument.  Too bad, since I would tend to agree with this point  of view! 
  Hard to believe it has been ten years since Load came out. Like many Metallica fans I recoiled against it, not because of the songs per say, but the whole image change, the shock of Metallica being on Lollapalloza, the disgust at seeing the arrogant attitudes displayed by Hetfild and Ulrich towrds Metallicas established fan base and the genre of heavy metal in general.It was too much for many people to take, and they rejected Load right then and there.    That said, with 10 years passing by, one can listen to Load is a clear eye(or ear). The fact is that while Load is not up to the previous standards of Metallica, it isint all that bad of an album, and despite the dramatica image change, it isint "alternative", either. What Load is more or less is Metallicas interpertation of 70s style blues based hard rock/metal. Think Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Sad Wings of Destiny era Judas Priest, Deep Purple, Budgie, UFO and Thin Lizzy. It are these influences that are most heard in Load. The mid temp, chunky riffs, the wah-wah pedal drenched solos, simple 4/4 based arrangements. Certarinly a big change from the agressive and also progressive nature of previous Metallica albums(even the Black album still had agressive and progressive influences).    The problem with why Load doesnt work per say is mainly two fold. One, at 80 minuites, there is quite a bit of filler on it. The hard rock/metal groups in the 70s worked with a 45 minuite frame work at the very most when it came to LPs, Load would have been a double LP, and the number of successful double LPs in any genre of rock can be counted on by one hand(the only one I can think of in the hard rock/metal genre is Led Zepplins Physical Graffiti). The filler material really weights the album down. The other problem is the bland, mid range production that Bob Rock gave the album that robbed the guitars of their power.    Some of the songs despite the production shortcomings have held up fairly well over the last 10 years. Songs such as King Nothing, 2X4, Bleeding Me, Aint my [...], Torn Within, the Outlaw Torn and Wasting My Hate are fiarly solid. The problem is the rest of the material is not solid, and still has the lifeless sound. Had Metallica only released one instead of two LOADS, had Metallica had better, more lively production, and had Metallica taken the better tracks off ReLoad such as Fuel, Devils Dance, Unforgiven II and Where the Wild things are, then it very well may have been a near great CD(think 4 stars or A- grade), but alas, Metallica went a different route, and the Loads are still considered a failure overall.    I do not reccomend fans of hard rock/metal purchase the entire Load CD, but the individual tracks I listed for Ipod make for decent rotation material 
 This mis-titled book is probably the worst book I've ever purchased from that most respected technical publisher, O'Reilly.  I say the book is mis-titled since it weasel-words the title of "Learning PHP 5" (and all the new OOP re-write) into a few hundred pages devoted to the standard language constructs available in previous versions, and all but omits the real changes incorporated in the new version.  In fact, of the 254 pages in the chaptered part of the book only two pages even mention object oriented programming in this context, and simply recommend other O'Reilly books as reference.  I'm disappointed that O'Reilly would have let this book reach distribution 
 To be fair, my son liked this book reasonably well at age 3 or so. But his mom, dad, and grandmother HATED it every time that was the book he chose for us to read to him. Once in a while, there is a pleasantly poetic sound to the text, but overall, both the text and the "drawings" (which I could do on my computer)are aggressively simplistic, with no hint of cleverness or nuancing. Good children's books entertain not only children, but the adults who read to them. In a world with books by Maurice Sendak, Margaret Wise Brown, Roald Dahl, Shel Silverstein, Dr. Seuss, and more (including, when he's feeling a little more subtle, Kevin Henkes), it is unclear why anyone would pick this book. Instead, choose something BOTH you and your child enjoy - it will be a lot easier to instill a love of books if you don't have to hide your disdain while you're reading to your child 
 Lilly has always been the self-proclaimed feminist, but her influence on Mia definitely showed in this latest addition to the Princess Diaries series. Problem: Mia wants to attend the senior prom, but her boyfriend Michael doesn't want to, and it's only through him that she can go. Instead of considering what he wants, she whines and tries to subtly coerce him into going to the dance. She convinces her classmates to hire Michael's band to perform at the dance, further showing her true colors as it goes against even the band members' own wishes. The value she places on herself and her own desires, above the desires of others, is utterly selfish and disgusting. I strongly recommend NOT reading this book, it really made me dislike Mia as a character.  Why is the prom more important than respecting someone else's wishes? If Mia and Michael were so compatible, they wouldn't be split on this issue. From her insistence on the prom (which also seems uncharacteristic for her to want so badly), to the feminist view that men are oppressors and women shouldn't take their husbands' last names after marriage, Lilly's cold disregard for Boris' feelings and later hypocrisy over him and Tina, to the hateful quote that women need men like a fish needs a bicycle, and Mia's goal to "mold" her little brother into the perfect (read: pussified) boyfriend...shame on you, Ms. Cabot. You make masculinity something to be suppressed and ashamed of, when it should be revered.  Also, as some reviewers have said, 15 is a bit young to be exploring sexually, and it's illogical for Mia and Lilly to join in on such behavior. Since when does turning 15 equate with 'becoming a woman'? Kind of an odd thing to say 
 As Mr. Lincoln once said, " People who like this sort of thing, will find this the sort of thing they like".  My wife, a fan and American Studies major, loved it. I on the other hand found myself wishing that Patrick O'Brian were still alive.  The first chapter is the best section of the book, but was basically meaningless since I do not believe that baseball embodies Mystical American Goodness.  You will like this book if you are a Delillo fan, or believe that the literary critics know something that you don't.  If not, life is short, find something else 
 This has been the season for self-help exposes, and as someone who considers himself "in recovery" from the genre, I've read them all now--not just McGee's book, but Salerno's "SHAM" and Hoff-Sommers and Satel's "One Nation Under Therapy." For my money, McGee's book, though on its surface the most "scholarly" of the three, is also the least satisfying.   "Self-Help Inc." is basically a hodge-podge of pseudo-intellectual pretense, masquerading as social theory, that by its end devolves into a shameless paean to socialism. The book also drips with the sort of patronizing sociopolitical "enlightenment" that has so endeared the academy, and its hifalutin members, to mainstream America. The author brandishes her obsession with being (or at least seeming) "uber-deep," a tendency that handicaps so much of the social commentary emerging from academia. Indeed, McGee's writing is so pregnant with ivory tower argot that one assumes the subtitle--that line about the "makeover culture"--almost had to have been some bright-eyed marketing type's attempt to make the book sound hipper and more culturally relevant.    McGee does do a nice job of examining self-help's historical pedigree and underpinnings. She follows Anthony Robbins' spiel back to the New Thought movement of the early 20th century; she discerns Cotton Mather in Covey, and Emerson in the high priests of the New Age. Whereas Salerno argues that the movement cleaves into "victimization" and "empowerment," McGee divides the field into its "rational" and "expressive" sub-movements. (One supposes that she might have had her academic-in-good-standing card revoked for simply bracketing the dichotomy as "thoughts vs. feelings.") Again, this inclination to overreach, to look for complex philosophical explanations when quite-simple ones will do nicely, is par for the course. Also, at least in the view of this former self-help junkie, McGee makes the serious mistake of assuming that the broad appeal of self-help has to do with conscious striving, rather than subtler, more complex emotional forces. One doubts, for example, that the millions who slavishly watch Dr. Phil do so for reasons having to do with Nietzsche or Emerson, or even purposeful self-improvement. (McGraw is a textbook case in the mindless culture [or cult?] of celebrity that underlies so much of the self-help phenomenon, and its amazing ability to shatter its own records again and again.)  She asserts that people turn to self-help's "rational" side to learn to excel in a dog-eat-dog world, then repair to the "expressive" side as an escape from the foregoing. Is it me, or is McGee not guilty here of the same overblown, Rube Goldberg-like reasoning for which Salerno, Satel and Hoff-Sommers chastise the self-help movement itself? After all, is the essential dynamic here--working hard, then looking for a way to unwind/recharge--really so revolutionary?  Throughout the book, McGee's feminism is also showing, and sometimes in a most unbecoming way. Almost gratuitously, she feels compelled to explode the myth of the self-made man (by observing offhand that every successful man in history has had a good woman behind him, holding down home and hearth) and she characterizes success training and life coaching as bastardized children born of men's fear of having women move into the workplace and figuratively emasculate them. But her contentions about self-help's more sexist elements seem woefully out of touch with the available evidence, since self-help's feminizing effect on society (by every traditional benchmark of what it means to be "feminine") is significant and indisputable. Regardless of how you analyze the movement or label its component parts, can there be any doubt that self-help's overriding messages privilege feelings over thoughts, camaraderie over individual excellence, getting along over getting ahead? The truth of the matter seems not so much that people turn to self-help as a refuge from rampant feminism, but that self-help, certainly over the past few generations, has been one of the most important social forces underlying rampant feminism, and friendly to its goals.  McGee's determination to force-fit all evidence or observed phenomena into a preconceived framework is equally clear in her fondness for evaluating self-help regimens based on whether they could be rejiggered to support "progressive" political solutions. In the grips of this pluralistic, it-really-does-take-a-village mentality, she even suggests that recovery groups might marshal and redirect their energies to become latter-day communes of social activism.   Overall, McGee insists on bracketing self-help as a creature of competition-for jobs, mates, etc. It isn't long before one gets the sense that her real target is the free market itself, and it's that which really differentiates her book from SHAM and One Nation, both of which conceive self-help as more of a left-wing-influenced (or influencing) phenomenon. And correctly so, in my view.  
 I have never felt as compelled to write an online review of a product as I do right now...  First of all, the very title of this book is blatantly misleading.  And I believe this was intentional.  This isn't the science OF superheroes, this is the science AGAINST superheroes.  (Well, it is against all of them except the X-Men, but we'll get into that one in a bit.)  What the authors have done here is taken what could have potentially been a fun little ride through the land of superheroes, and turned it into a mean spirited trek through your most boring physics class.  After reading the title, you might expect to see a book describing the scientific aspects of how superheroes exist and function.  But you would be wrong.  Instead, the authors go well out of their way to disprove any notion that superheroes could exist.  I believe this was intentionally given a misleading title because they knew someone interested in superheroes would not be buying a book saying they are impossible.  I mean, come on... we all know they are impossible, be we would like to see science that shows what might be possible.  But this book does none of that.  This book is only about ripping the superhero genre to shreds.  Not only is the book 99% negative, but it is written in a way that is very degrading to fans of superhero based comic books.  Like other reviewers have said, it is as though the authors are just trying to bash comic books and fans of them.  Reading this book gives you the feeling that they would just love to tell us "Are you stupid?  Don't you realise this is impossible?!?"  The science isn't entirely accurate either.  For all of the looking down their noses at us that they do, these two enlightened people don't exactly have all their facts straight.  For example, in the chapter about Henry Pym, they describe how a person that is getting larger would actually become weaker with size, so that eventually he would not even be able to support his own weight.  So that means that my 36 year old body is impossible because I am alot bigger than I was when I was 5.  But yet, here I am.  Heck, maybe I'm a superhero...  I guess dinosaurs were impossible too, because they were pretty doggone big.  The authors also say that Pym shrinking down to ant size would increase his relative strength tremendously.  If this would be the case, at 5'-11" I can lift my own weight so that would mean that a person significantly smaller than me, such as a midget, should be able to lift many time his/her own weight.  I don't think so....  Now, the famous X-Men chapter...  As a believer in the Bible, I am deeply offended by this chapter.  Not one single scientific fact was made about the X-Men.  NOT A SINGLE ONE.  Instead, the authors used this chapter as a soapbox to deliver a long tirade about how they think Creationists are trying to deceive the world about our origins.  They go on to say that everyone who believes in Creationism thinks that the world was created on October 22, 4004 BCE!!!  Let me tell you, I believe that God created the Universe, but I have never heard this mess about October 22, 4004 BCE.  Through this entire chapter, they do nothing but ridicule and insult people who believe in God and Creation.  Then to top it all off, they end the chapter by saying the X-Men are not only possible, but probable in our future!!!!  So, we get to look forward to guys shooting lasers our of their eyes, people controlling the weather with their minds, people who can morph into perfect copies of other people, not to mention others who can walk through walls, freeze moisture in the air, shoot fire from their hands, etc... Hey, the authors said all this is probably going to happen in our future!!  (sigh)  This chapter alone was enough to make me stop reading this book.  It was not a very enjoyable read to begin with, but once I got to the end of the X-Men chapter I had enough.  And from other reviews, I see that the authors think Donald Duck is the shining example of a good scientific comic book.  As one other reviewer said... Talking Ducks....  To sum it all up, I don't see that there is any market for this book.  People wanting to know the science behind their favorite superhero are not going to enjoy this book because they will find out that nothing supports their favorite character, unless that character just happens to be blue and can teleport with a BAMF sound, which in that case the authors say that is entirely probable.  People who are not interested in superheroes are not going to buy this book for obvious reasons.  So who does that leave as the target audience of this book??  No one.  And that is exactly who I would recommend this book to 
 If you want to be terribly disappointed then buy this book. It is small with a comment for each page that has a cartoon. You can read the whole book in 30 seconds. This book is a good example of someone who just wants to make money, and not interested at all in giving the reader interesting insights. A 7 year old could write this book 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 Whenever Clint Willis finally gets around to compiling a book about hating Saddam Hussein and Osama bin-Laden, then Clint and his cronies might have some credibility. As it is, their blind hatred and knee-jerk reactionary attitudes against Conservatives have produced reams of commentary...loopy, mean-spirited, small-minded ideas that are fundamentally wrong about nearly everything in the world. These pundits' loathing of Conservatism has blinded them against the real enemies of America and freedom. Ironically, it's the Conservatives who provide the strength, vision, and courage to defend the rights of Liberals to spew their opinions. Hatred...that's what this book is. At least truth in advertising is in effect here. 
 I'm not sure what the other reviewers found so compelling.  I found little here other than pages and pages of lists.  Some examples: 6pp. of LAPD police radio codes, 3pp. of FBI case classifications, 16pp. of org charts for the LA County Sherrif's Dept.  My favorite, however, is the full page devoted to a listing of "Weapons Used by Criminals" which begins "Acid, Air gun, Ax, Bayonet, Bazooka, Billy Club..."  Well, you get the idea.  The portions of the book not devoted to lists tend to be laughably superficial (e.g., "Street gangs now battle over who sells the drugs and where."  Really, thanks.)  Granted, there are suggestions for further reading, but my advice would be to save yourself some money and do your readers a favor -- do your own research 
 My hsuband and and decided that I would nurse Hailey her entire first year.  I work at a school and was able to pump twice a day.  I didn't like doing it in school though because there wasn't space for it.  SO I would go in my car and do it.  All I had a first was the battery pack.  I would go through 10 batteries a week and half way through the week I would loose strength/suction.  Once I got the adapter I never had a problem again.  We could go anywhere and I would always have access to power Including when we drove from VA to GA.  My husband would drive and I would pump.  It is great.. 
 I'm a huge fan of the Ultimate lines of X-Men, Spiderman, Ultimate(Avengers), and of course the Fantastic Four.  For that reason, I am deeply upset with how UFF Vol. 4: Inhuman turned out.  First off, this cover is way too decieving.  Jae Lee, while an obviously talented artist, is definitely not the write person to be drawing for the Ultimate series.  It completely veered away from the amazing artwork done in the first 3 volumes, which is pretty much the uniform look for the entire Ultimate universe. The stories definitely could have been better written and needed to be spanned out more.  2 issues is definitely not enough to fully tell the story with the Thinker.  Then you have that UFF Annuals #1 which was even worse than the Thinker story.  TOO SHORT, plus the artwork was just wrong.  It was all a rare miss in the Ultimate line and having seen the upcoming Vol. 5: Crossover, it doesn't appear to be one that's going to be repeated 
 The number of fallacious arguments in this collection of essays boggles the mind.But what do you expect fron the likes of Jeremy Rifkin,who has had a glorious 40 year record of failed predictions and doomsday scenarios behind him?What can you expect from a Jerry Mander,who sincerely thinks that life was better before plumbing,medicine,running water,sanitation and other manifesations of civilizations' corruptions that destroyed the "Noble Savage"?One truly fallacious argument is the idea that land should revert back to a "Commons",a policy that is directy responsible for the deforestation,pollution and shortages so common in many 3rd world nations.It is precisely private land ownership,along with restrictions of usage,that makes environmental solvency possible.Many of the authors continually bash multinational corporations,but it is precisely the inflow of investment capital that leaders of poorer nations have been clamoring for-capital that makes the building of infrastructure possible.Big business gets the blame for 3rd world poverty from these authors,somehow oblivious to the fact that poverty has been a way of life for certain nations for as long as history can recall,and that it is only now that material comfort,a safe and abundant food supply,medicine,a longer,more comfortable life is now becoming possible for peoples around the world.The "Noble Savage":impoverished,diseased,dead by 35;this  paradise these Luddites imagine more primitive societies to be only shows what conceit,condescension and sillyness is at work in their thinking.These elitists want others to live in a cultural musueum so that they can turn on PBS or the Discovery channel and coo 'Awww.Look at the quaint little villagers work their quaint little plot of soil.And look at their quaint little straw huts.Awwww.' P.S. Don't fail to notice that those who preach the virtues of anti-technology and anti-modernity fail to follow the religion that they want everyone else to follow 
 First, let me say, I LOVE Koyaanisqatsi, the original film in this trilogy. Koyaanisqatsi is a true visual poem that tells a straight forward story about what we humans are doing to the earth. The second film in the trilogy, Powaqqatsi, wasn't as good as the first but it was still fairly understandable as a critique of how humans exploit one another. Naqoyqatsi could have been the best in the series since it had ample opportunity to show us the horrors of war. Instead, it comes off as a sophomoric exercise in video experimentation, nothing more. If not for Philip Glass' music, I would not have given this film any rating at all. I write this criticism in hopes that Godfrey Reggio sees it. He should pull this travesty off the market and reshoot the entire film with stronger footage showing us, as clearly as he did with "Koy", why war (the topic of "Naq") is so horrific. If you want an effective critique of violence, try "Clockwork Orange". Naqoyqatsi is simply a mess 
     In China, the 1990s brought sizzling economic growth, cool political stability and a steady expansion of personal freedom for urban residents. Shanghai, Beijing and other cities became modern and cosmopolitan. Peace reigned on all borders. Was it brilliant leadership that won these triumphs for China? Or was it a combination of circumstances, only mildly affected by the man in charge at the time, Jiang Zemin?      In a new biography of Jiang, Robert Lawrence Kuhn tries to credit the former Communist Party chief with a primary role in China's advances. Yet by telling Jiang's story in detail, Kuhn's book reveals Jiang to be an above-average Party official, most skilled in the art of pleasing his superiors, whose great feat was simply political survival. The title of the book is `The Man Who Changed China.' But Jiang did not change China in any significant way. He climbed into the driver's seat at a time when the steering wheel was held by others. Only after years as Communist Party chief did Jiang assume real power, and once he had it, he showed no special flair for leadership. He just kept driving on the road laid out for him by Deng Xiaoping.      How Jiang rose - from his first job fixing machines at a Shanghai ice cream company through a series of middling administrative positions to become Mayor of Shanghai and then China's Communist Party chief - certainly is a good tale. Jiang was born into an educated family in Yangzhou, north of Shanghai. His uncle was a Communist revolutionary who died in battle, giving Jiang an important credential for future leadership. Trained as an engineer, Jiang was known as a big reader with a good memory and a talent for making friends. At Jiang's first job, in the ice cream company, he was on hand when a Party official named Wang Daohan came to visit on day in September, 1949. Jiang gave a presentation and a factory tour, and impressed Wang with his energy and optimism.  Wang eventually decided to take Jiang under his wing, and over the next 40 years, he nurtured Jiang's rise by winning him jobs in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Changchun.      Jiang was an intelligent but cautious administrator. He had no special charisma. As Kuhn reports, he was frequently underestimated. Meaning, he often came across as a lightweight. But over time he would prosper, primarily by diligent work and an ability to offend no one. He survived the Cultural Revolution and other political campaigns by keeping his head down.Kuhn's book is thorough. He recites a month-by-month summary of Jiang's years in power, often including details about the leader's taste for reciting poetry or the Gettysburg address,  and singing songs. Jiang loved to perform, and to show off.      For anyone who needs a compendium of Jiang's public appearances and political acts during those years, this is an excellent guide. Readers looking for real insight into Chinese politics will be disappointed. One strength of Kuhn's book is the access he gained, interviewing Jiang's sister and several of his close aides, including Wang Daohan. They offer intriguing personal anecdotes that inevitably show what a wise and thoughtful man Jiang has been. Kuhn's book is weakest where it counts most. At Jiang's critical moments - the Tiananmen protests and crackdown in 1989 that led to his ascension, the demise of political rivals Yang Shangkun and Chen Xitong - Kuhn offers little insight or fresh information.      Most annoying is Kuhn's tendency to repeat Communist pablum as though it were anything beyond a Party line, such as Jiang's `core beliefs' in socialism and Party control, obviously a prerequisite to any government position. Kuhn, an advisor to the Chinese government as well as host of a PBS television series, sometimes writes like an American businessman freshly introduced to the vast potential of the China market: breathless, overly credulous, and looking for opportunity. Yet Kuhn's approach to Jiang's story - getting every detail - generally yields a basic accuracy to major trends and events. For instance, Kuhn describes the decision in 1992 to accelerate economic growth that led to China's broad flourishing over the following decade.   It was a decision made by Deng Xiaoping, and at first resisted by Jiang and other leaders, who feared that it would lead to inflation and social unrest. True to his nature, Jiang saw that it was in his interest to follow, and then champion, Deng's views. But it was Deng who insisted on moving faster. He was the man who truly changed China. Not Jiang. 
 Yep this is pretty much pop metal for twelve year old girls par excellence. This stuff may not require a lot of musical talent but it certainly requires plenty of stylists for hair - perhaps sitting around in stylists chairs does count as 'suffering for your art'.   But honest injun, I only review albums that I actually own and since I've never ever thrown away a single disc ever bought - well you guessed it - I paid for it and still own it.  The airheaded pop stuff here is truly grating. My list of major problems with this release is;  1 - A band called Danger Danger puts out an album with the lead track of Naughty Naughty. The saving grace is that Naughty Naughty is a darn fine song. Really, the genre doesn't get much better than this. Pity about the rest of this album. 2 - This is the kind of band that Metal Edge magazine pushed to the fore - one of the most horrid segments of the mag was entitled 'The Way the Were' which actually had photos of the band members as kids. Really, pandering to the musical tastes of 12 year old girls is not the way forward. Then again, at the time D/D made a bit of cash so perhaps they're the ones laughing now. 3 - "Bang Bang - what's that sound / I gave you my heart then you shot me down"    If Naughty Naughty was the genre at it's best then tunes like Bang Bang were the genre at it's most dire.  I have nothing but good memories of this band - they certainly gave us all a good laugh at the time. Despite the fact that in so many ways this only deserves one star, I can't possibly do it. These guys bent over backwards to make themselves seem so nice you wouldn't want to hurt their feelings. Not to mention the fact that Saturday Nite also rocks well. Two great songs and a couple of other good hooks just don't rate so it can't get more than two stars 
 I had a very frustrating experience two times I tried to buy this book...each time I recieved book that had no illustrations or plates or diagrams that were listed in the contents...I had books with 174 pages when the book is supposed to have 300 pages...I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS ABOUT BUT I FINALLY CALLED BORDERS AND THEY HAVE THE BOOK WITH 300 PAGES WHICH I bought WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF 
 I have not read this book but I am a real life Eunuch. I had my testicles surgically removed. In an Interview on Salon.com the author says "Castration does not get rid of the sexual drive, get rid of erections or any amount of sexual activity." WRONG!!!  How would he know any way? He is NOT a Eunuch. He has had a vasectomy but that is totally different. I can speak from experience; when a man becomes a eunuch his sex drive drops to absolute zero. I had a very strong sex drive prior to castration but it is now completely gone. The only way for a Eunuch to regain his sex drive is to take some form of testosterone replacement. I have never heard of any real life Eunuch who was not on testosterone replacement therapy that had a sex drive. Don't waste your time on this book; the author obviously didn't do enough, if any research. If you want to learn about Eunuchs then search the web. There are a lot of us out there, and our numbers are growing 
 I've always been a Raitt fan since the '70s.  Gave this new one a try and was very disappointed.  The style seems to jump around and is not the sound she's known for.  All you need to hear of this one is the free samples. Don't suggest you buy this one if you really like the songs she's built her rep on 
 I will preface this review by saying that in a fair world I would give this record 2.5 or 3 stars.   Unfortunately, since I reserve a bit of  knee-jerk, arrogant spite for over-hyped bands, I have to knock them down to a solid 2 stars for this release. Sorry guys.  Although TVoTR has improved slightly in craft since the Young Liars EP, they still leave much to be desired. Actually, it appears that they've made a career out of leaving much to be desired.  This band specializes in leading listeners on a drawn-out journey to nowhere. Although nowhere is only about four or five minutes down the road, it seems to take forever.  Some people dig that vibe. I don't. The band seems to be more intereted in ideas and aesthetics than making truly great music. It is only fair to mention that this is what fans of the band seem to like most about them.  David Sitek, the TV on the Radio's in-house producer seems to have a history of working with bands that priorotize fashion (or, to be nice, 'aesthetics') over music. The Yeah Yeah Yeah's are a good example. Unlike Yeah Yeah Yeah's however, TV on The Radio's personality is definitely its own.  TV On The Radio is like a melancholy version of a bad Saturday Night Live sketch. Every song on this record feels as if it's based on one half-baked, half-decent idea, repeated ad-nauseum.  If the guys down the hall from your old college dorm made music like this, you might be right for supporting them and singing their praises. Unfortunately, the band isn't a bunch of college kids attempting their first DIY project, and we are right to expect more from them. Especially when they're no more interesting, only more slick than your average sampler-toting avant-pop 20 year-olds.  They purposefully build tension with no release, and manage to do so in a rather uncompelling and uninteresting fashion. While listening to this record, some listeners may find themselves expecting any one of the songs to finally "go somewhere". This is a bad idea, as they're not big on 'pay-off'.   They are much more interested in monotonous redundancy. Some people will love that, but be warned if that's not your thing. Trust-fund urbanites, pretentious scenesters, heroin addicts, and stoners may find a lot to like on this record.  The rest of us will have to wait as the band marginly improves and, with any luck, lets go of their impulse to purposefully avoid being any good. Either that, or we can avoid listening to them, and find some other critics's darling to fawn over for now.  (Disclaimer: A few sentences that are stll appropriate here are borrowed from an earlier review that I wrote about the Young Liars EP. 
 I didn't like this book because it's so hard to understand what's going on; with all the poetry and stuff.I however liked how the author described the dog and the cute picture on the cover. I mostly rated this book 2 stars because of the dog dying in the end. I mean at one moment the dog is happily chasing the ball and then.... sorry I had to wipe my eyes; and then he gets killed by a car.I hate it when animals die in books so i'm going to change my rating to only one star.  If you like crying go and read this book, but I hated it 
 No melody, no rhythm; just noise. I'm heading to the used CD store with it as soon as I can. I'd rate it zero stars if I coul 
 I would like to reiterate a few points that I've seen in other reviews but I don't think were stressed enough. You should know this before you consider buying the dvd: 1. The acting is horrible.  horrible. 2. The film was obviously low budget. 3. It is over thirty years old, and it feels dated. 4. The story (which was amazing as a novel) did not translate well to film. Don't waste your time on the movie 
 The Shipping News by Annie Proulx is a rather odd book. Little action, nice descriptions of Nova Scotia, and far fetched characters are in this book.  The book tells the story of Quoyle. Quoyle is a newspaper reporter for a 3rd rate paper in New York. He is ugly, fat, and has very low self esteem. After his wife leaves him for another man and sells his two daughters (as I said, odd book), his wife dies in a car accident. Quoyle takes back his kids and moved back to his ancestrial homeland of Killick-Claw Nova Scotia. There he lives day-to-day.  I read this book with several other people. All of them found this book very boring and hard to get through. Nobody felt any remorse for the protaganists problems, or even cared.   I would not suggest this book. It is kinda like a roller coaster,once you think that you are going for the sky (an interesting plot development), you find yourself plunging toward the ground. For the story gets worse 
 This is not a biography but rather a discussion of each of Hitchcock's films. For each film there is: - Detailed synopsis - Cast and Crew details - Analysis of the film  These first two of these items can be obtained from the Internet for free and who really wants to know the details of the story anyway? The analysis of each film is largely a waste of time as Spoto tends to over-analyse each film to the point of distraction while offering no real insights.  If you want to find out more about Hitchcock's films I would recommend McGilligan's excellent biography. This discusses each film in the context of Hitchcock's life and career and is far more illuminating 
 This film is laughably bad. The entire plot is completely unrealistic and it is difficult to have any sympathy for the cruel murderer who is central to the plot, who is not only a murderer but also totally retarded, missing numerous opportunities to escape and make life easier for himself and the saps who for some random reason have taken it upon themselves to look after him. This film is an absolute waste of time, but feel free to watch it if you feel like wasting 107 minutes of your life 
 The skin is a great idea, but it is not practical.  It is too thick to work with the Seidio Cradle I have, so I must pull off the skin to sync my Treo.  The skin buttons do not always line up with the TREO buttons, so I misfire applications.  The holster is a joke as it snaps over top the expansion card slot constantly ejecting the card every time I pull the phone off the holster.  Do not place the phone in your pocket with the skin on unless you need to see the inside of your pocket liner as it will not come out cleanly 
 I'm a fan of other Time Out guidebooks, particularly Time Out's Eating and Drinking in Rome, but this book is a huge disappointment.  First, the type is so tiny that it's difficult to read.  Second, the book is filled with advertisements - not just one or two but at least a hundred. This makes the book seem no better than the cheap guides you find for free in many hotel rooms. Third, in checking out just two things, I've found two errors. Ever hear of 22 volt electricity? That's what this book says runs in Argentina. (Correct voltage is 220 volts.) Another error is in giving the wrong page number for information about Teatro Colon. You are directed to page 198 which informs you instead about gay life in Buenos Aires. (The information about Teatro Colon is actually on page 204.) So, do I trust any other information in this book? Nope! Will I bother carrying this book with me to Buenos Aires? Absolutely not!   
 This book is quite a simple (and sometimes unusefull) introduction to design/build Speaker System. Design principles are old and it does not cover new trends such as implementation of spice models and simulation. Maybe only source code (written in BASIC for DOS!) can be interesting for an absolute beginner, ... eventhough it's cheap, save your money 
 Essentially the book is a rehash of the old creative financing techniques touted by the real estate gurus of the 1980's. And where are they now?    With the exception of some updated techniques for the Internet, the approach is the same: 1. Find people with money. 2. Find sellers who want to dump their trashy properties, then put the two together.    Since it always takes money to make money the whole scheme is dependant on your being able to find "money people".     If there is any value in the book it is that it is a much cheaper way to get this type of info than having to buy the high priced infomerical stuff.    True, there will be a few who will make their fortunes by buying fixer uppers at a discount but most copies of this book will end up with all the other "real estate riches" type books - selling for a buck or two at the used book stores 
 This book is only good if you have absolutely zero experience or knowledge of podcasting.  If you have already recorded a few shows, this book isn't for you 
 First off the Software is Horrible!! I have XP Media Center and the Win2000 interface program won't even run. The hardware drivers interfere with other programs on my computer; Now my Cineplayer has no sound and when i double click on my speaker icon in my tray, an error message comes up saying I have no active mixer devices available. I spent hours trying to resolve and my computer is still messed up.  The remote is useless, I will have to get a Microsoft remote, and the picture quality using Media Center is POOR at best.  Save your money and AVOID this item.  IF YOU HAVE TO TRY IT, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND INSTALLING NORTON GOBACK OR SIMILAR SOFTWARE TO UNDO THE PROBLEMS YOU WILL HAVE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!! 
 The translation of the book is done very poorly.  There are sentences that don't make sense in the English language that may in French. Or, I'm guessing, they are errors in the translation.  There are the use of French terms with slips into American colloquialisms.  E.g., calling a psychiatrist an "analyst" in one sentence, then a "shrink" in another.    I think the basic idea of the book came across, but the translation was terrible. It was awkward and jumpy, which really detracted from the storyline. I'm going to buy the French version of the book and put it through the babelfish translator and I'm sure I'll understand this story more than the current translation 
      "Indie" is a word typically used to justify subpar music that nobody could like otherwise. Call something "Indie", and I guarantee some schmuck in a Starbucks will be all over it and praising it as the masterpiece it never deserved to be called. They'll equate the young musician to Bon Dylan if he happens to play an acoustic (no matter how inadequately the guitar is played). Apparently to many of the people here, anything on an acoustic is Folk.   Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of Beck's music (most of Mellow Gold and all of Odelay), but when you unplug Beck and take away his nifty studio tricks (turntable scratching and studio gloss), you've just got one big mess on your hands. There's no question about it: Beck is a media darling, and in the eyes of Indie fanboys Rock critics for the likes of Rolling Stone, he can do no wrong, no matter how awful an album he puts out. Case in point: This monstrosity on an "album". I could create a better album than this if somebody gave me two cardboard boxes to bang on and an out-of-tune guitar with only three strings. Those were what Beck used for this album, right? Beck probably tells detractors his "quirky" lyrics can make up for the abysmal execution of these songs, but this just isn't true. The squeaky vocals are annoying, the random blathering of nonsensical words is stupid, and the poor quality of said vocals and lyrics should be enough to keep people from blowing their cash on this dud. But it doesn't. Because it's Indie. What a waste. Knowing there were talented Folk musicians out there that were passed over in favor for this sh*t is just plain sad. Remember, not everything on an acoustic is Folk, you Indie elitists. And you guys say you hate being labeled... 
 "In My Country" is undermined straight from the start by its tone deaf casting. This film - based on the narrative writings of stellar South African journalist Antjie Krog - somehow gets a starring duo of a Frenchwoman and Irishman playing Afrikaaners and an American (Samuel L. Jackson) ludicrousy grafted on top of the screenplay for the sake of starpower and a wacky, contrived melodrama that never existed in Krog's tale.  This is most unfortunate because Krog's stories - her take on South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission - is one that should be heard far and wide.  Unfortunately, the filmmakers bury that behind this odd and inexplicable need to feature a quasi-adulterous liaison between Binoche and Jackson's characters.  How did it turn out?  Take a look at the DVD extras:  Samuel L. Jackson is nowhere to be found.  This is a man who knows quality and knows junk.  He must taken a look at the final product and ran from this thing as fast as he could.    Good move. Smart guy 
 After reading the 1st two books in Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy and enjoying them immensely, I was more than just a little disappointed in the 3rd volume.   Hobb appears to have burnt out.  He devotes pages and pages to boring pointless journeys, opens a promising theme - Old Blood - and never develops it and his evil king character develops a split personality, alternatly swinging from evil genius to drug addeled dilettante.  I finished the book but it  was so poorly done I had a real hard time not just chucking it part way thru.      
 I actually threw this book away,something I almost never do. This author drags together every half-baked story anyone has ever written down and presents it,with no evidence or eyewitness statements, as it is.Do you believe that a pack of evil ghost-dogs prowl highway 666 in New Mexico? Neither do I-but they're here in this "collection." Anyone reading this review could have written a book that would be at least as good as this one. Don't spend any money on this book! Try to find a good book instea 
 I wish I had read this about 30 years ago. A lot of practical information with her usual wit and humour.  Alexandra is always personal, warm and human.  
 This book purports to be a college text for discrete math.  It is terrible.  There aren't nearly enough examples in the book.  Explanations are woefully brief, giving one sentence to the definition of a set intersection, for example.  Many new concepts sneak up on you without ever being discussed.  In one instance it started using a point by point proof method without ever introducing that method.  The rules given in some proofs are not defined earlier, leaving the reader to wonder what the authors are doing in their proof.  The use of Haskel is another downside.  There is no way to check your proofs aside from the proof checker software included which will drive a person to complete insanity.  The software is so terribly picky in its syntax, you take more time verifying your proof than actually coming up with it.  When there are errors with your syntax, it doesn't give a meaningful message.  This is more the fault of Haskel, however.  Nevertheless, it is the fault of the authors to choose this terrible method for teaching.  Garbage 
 Maybe the author wrote this book as part of his therapy.  It could have been such a nice book.    To read about something as idiotic as putting a small dog and a weasel into a barrel and closing the lid until one killed the other is just too much.  The dog is the one left alive, but has been hurt so badly they have to shoot it in the head.  Then there is the pig mating scene.  Yes, we all know "it" happens, but my child does not need to read about "thrusting" and blood running down the gilt's leg.  The boar owner makes a comment that the next time the gilt will stand still for it.  Great message for young girls.  When I asked children what they remember about the book, they tell me the above stories.  One did not even remember the boy's father dies, but remembered the above graphic situations.  Much is lost on them.    The graphic situations ruined what could have been a good book 
 I didn't understand why so many people liked this book many years ago when I read it, and I don't understand it any better today.  A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel.  Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look.  Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story.  There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people.  Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions.  The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene.  The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high.  Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc.  I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.  Tom Wolfe should stick to non-fiction, which he does well 
 The "microscope" never worked at all. It is cheap plastic and very badly made. You get a few small pieces of indicator paper and a few bags of baking soda, citric acid and gelatin plus one prepared slide you will not be able to view with the "microsope".  Very disappointing. The Discovery Channel kits are better value. Don't waste your money on this kit 
 I really like Wayne Shorter.  I've liked everything from his early Blue Note recordings through Weather Report and most of his recent stuff.  But I have an incredibly hard time listening to this cd.  It seemed like it would be a great cd.  I mean..John Patitucci, Wayne Shorter, and Danilo Perez should be pretty hard to beat.  But I do not hear anything special here.  I was incredibly disappointed with this cd.  
 Did not received this item.  Vendor was out of stock.  So they cancelled my orde 
 I ordered this book because of the good reviews it got from other readers, but I was disappointed when I got it. It is yet another book that comes from the viewpoint that men are thinkers and women are feelers -- there is an entire chapter titled "When Men Don't Feel". This may work well when a thinker and a feeler are paired up together, but it's useless otherwise. If you are looking for a fresh perspective on male-female relationships, this isn't it 
 Someone bought this 3D DVD for my almost 5 year old daughter.  We thought the special effects would be fascinating and they were.  However,  within minutes of the movie's beginning my daughter was in tears. I won't say why but she found the plot frightening.  Several times during the movie I tried to talk her out of watching but she wanted to see what happened in the end.  Fortunately the movie is relatively short.  Overall, I found the story to be a cynical look at Christmas.  As an adult, I think it might be humourous to watch after a hard day of Christmas shopping but I urge caution before showing it to young children.  There was way too much animated violence to match the spirit of Christmas 
 If you read anything substantial with regard to John Lennon. You realize he didnt care particularly for intellectuals that had the need to impress people by attempting to show everyone how intelligent they are. Unfortunately that seems to be the case with the Mr. Tim Riley, the author of this Book. I too am a huge fan of the Beatles and  know every song they ever wrote. I have listened  intently to all the songs that John and Paul  wrote as Beatles. Not only for the purpose of analyseing there style which I truly loved, but more for the pure musical enjoyment and the happines that they brought to me and the rest of the world at such a special time in History. I am also a musician for over 40 years....... But the pontification of Mr. Riley, to speak with such subjective and self proclaimed knowledge of the thoughts of each of the boys from Liverpool, as though he knew exactly what was going through each of their respective minds with every note they played and every drum beat that came from Ringo's Ludwigs and his use of adjectives describeing John's Pain in particular phrases of individual songs on certain recordings was beyond preposterous. He made Howard Cosewll sound like a Humble Pubescent. Notwithstanding this dramatic turn off style of writing, there is no doubt that he has considerable knowledge of music in a technical sence and  the book is informative with regard to dates and times songs were written and recorded. But there are so many more objective  books with that information and that dont require you to suffer the self inflated pomposity of such a musical intellectual.  Try  The Beatles  Day by Day (etc:)by Craig Cross or even Beatlesongs by William Dowlding...  
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 "happy"  has a really good smell but unfortinately its all gone after 5 mins. It is like cheap colognes. 
 (...)This CD is sub-par.  Most of the beats are cool, but they're overlayed with too many cheesy lyrics 
 Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"  This is one of those books.   Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.   Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.   And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much 
 I've had my futon a little over two months and was very happy with it initially until one day two of the wooden slats which are all held in place with plastic fell apart (and I only weigh 100lbs).  I tried everything to fix the problem to no avail.  So considering it only lasted a few months, it really is not worth the money at all.  The price is cheap but so is the quality.  For what it will cost me to replace this one, I could've bought a much better quality futon without the disappointment and aggravation 
 i'vc had this book since i was 7 years old. i loved the awesome photos of echanis doing his thing. if you like the elaborate and complex, then this is the knife fighting book for you. there are simpler ways of "getting it done", but few are more fun to try. and, by the way, if any of you are curious as to how he died, he was killed while "training" in nicaragua. hmmm . .  
 Although providing nice code examples and clearly explaining the mathemantics of standard computer graphics algorithms, its ~270 (paperback) pages do not cover the scope or detail of the ~1100 (hardcover) pages in "Computer Graphics" by Foley, van Damm, et al., which costs roughly the same amount. John Wiley & Sons needs to be brought to task on the pricing issue, as the high price really shadows the real value (and business opportinity) of the book. My conspiracy theory is that the publisher is aiming to market it as a text book where students can't counter being ripped off by a publisher endorced by a professor or university 
 Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??" This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it" 
 After reading the book "Ask and it is given" and realy enjoying these wonderful teachings I was very excited to learn that a new book is available. I could not wait to order it and the day I received it I started to read right away, in excitement  to find more teachings. Much to may dissapointment I found out the the book "The amazing Power of deliberate intent" is almost a total copy of the first book, with the same storys and even the same excercises 
 This dictionary may be good for the layman, but it is far too general for a law student or lawyer.  Only the most common legal words are included, so most of the words are familiar to lawyers.  Those words that are obscure enough to require a dictionary are not included.  I would recommend this dictionary to a layman who wants to understand simple legal terms, but not to a lawyer or law student 
 And here I thought only Lindzen and Singer could write with such deliberate obfuscation in mind. Hooray for the status quo, let's do nothing until it is too late 
 This book revolves around two premises:  Good Girls please others, Gutsy Girls please themselves.  Whatever happened to focusing on results and what needs to be done at work?  An effective person, male or female, doesn't matter which, focuses on the tasks and strategies that advance the business' objectives instead of playing gamesmanship (or in this case, gameswomanship) with others.  Ms. White makes it sound so droll to be a "good girl" and denigrates her to no end, when in reality she is portraying a doormat straw-woman so that she can contrast with her "gutsy girl" persona who doesn't give a hoot about anyone but how she can get ahead and elbow her way to the top.  Modern business relies on teamwork and collaboration, and such a self-centered approach will not get the best long term results 
 This book irritated me on many levels; not that the writing was poor or the plot weak. In fact, the plot, the premise, the writing were good--unfortunately the characters didn't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable.  I read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction--regardless of plot--is because they care about someone in the book.   In this book, I was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story...  
 Definitely rated five stars if your under the age of ten. Adults beware.  These guys have run out of ideas since the first season and are proceeding on the fumes from their fart jokes. I hope Trey and Parker make vast amounts of money to help pay for voice impersonation lessons. Besides the smugness, I am tired of all the voices in South Park sounding all too similar. 
 Stephen King is a master of suspense, but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece.'  I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel. I found it much too long and anti-climactic. The character development is extensive and wonderful, but if I had to read about one more commitee meeting I was going to throw the book out the door. Near the book's end I was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop.   The great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length. In the end I understood why his editors cut it down. I had much more fun reading Salem's Lot 
 I have had trouble and no satisfaction with this product.  I am downloading Grateful Dead concerts from the internet. I want to turn them into audio or data CDs. Sometimes I get a whole concert as one giant file; I want to cut that into tracks and save it. Sometimes I get a bunch of tracks; I want to combine the songs that "go into" one another (my car stereo inserts a two-second delay between tracks). One of the things I want to do is to save the files (which are mostly MP3s) in the same bit rate and format as the originals, so I loose as little "music" as possible.  The MP3 codec seems to be really buggy. Most of the combinations of bit rates and codec strategies create really wacky files: some go 5/6 normal speed, others are compressed into chopped up shortened versions of the original. When I pick a combination of settings that work, I usually lose a lot of fidelity as compared to the original (even when I'm only combinining four MP3's into one).  Try cutting one MP3 into two, and then recombining the parts into a whole. No matter what I try, there's a little click in the place where the two files are joined. This should be an easy thing, since a lot of very basic editing is cutting and splicing.  The upshot is, buying this was $40 down the drain. I'm going to have to find better software for my purposes 
 This movie never gets off the ground, due to "political correctness", i did see it's potential wasted in almost every scene.every scene had the chance to become outragesly funny but never takes off. theres almost no nudity, none by the female lead at all, all punchline and no joke with this movie. typical politically correct movie for these days 
 The quality of the recording was very bad. Little squares showed up all the time and in dramatic scene changes the whole screen was transitioning little squares, like it could just not keep up with the speed. I would defintely not buy it again.  
 I had thought this was a great book for learning how to use Dutch Ovens for cooking. Lots of good general info and many nice pics. But, when it comes to the recipes I just don't get how the author can get them so screwed up. As I am new to Dutch Oven cooking I followed the recipes and cooking times precisely. I just wish the author had taken the time to take each recipe and follow it as per the directions to re-test the directions. Many of the cooking times are just plan screwed up and incorrect. As an example, there is no way in this world that the 1 hr cooking time for the sausage and sauerkraut recipe is anywhere near close to correct. Being new, I followed this literally and found that 1 hr is totally inadequate to get the dish to cook thoroughly. Tonite, I am trying the Big Woods Chichen recipe. One hour is completely inadequate for cooking. I am now trying to get the recipe to cook at 2 hrs. I'm sure my rice will be completely overcooked when the chicken is finally done. I am using a Viking professional stove which has been tested and calibrated and am also using a Lodge Dutch oven. Please don't waste your money on this book. It looks good but when you follow the recipes to the letter the results are poor and very disappointing!!!!!!!

 Per the description, it sounded like these would fit snug.  Well, they fit too snug, feeling very cramped. I have a 33 inch waist, and ordered the 32/34 waist.   I'm used to boxer briefs made from cotton.  This was the first time that I've got polyester boxer briefs.  Unless you like 'um really tight, you might want to go to the next size up, or just get cotton briefs.  I'm throwing these away 
 Myers' earlier books were palatable, but this one pales badly.  Magdalena has become not only cutesy but (gag) politically correct.  I couldn't get past the fourth page.   Myers comes off as a Diane Mott Davidson wannabe, and falls considerably short 
 I know there are many different Jewish beliefs and approaches. I am not Jewish. The author makes an honest & straitforward approach. A decent read 
 Please do not waste your money on this badly written, infomercial of a book.   Most of the book is about how everything around you is bad for you. The water you drink, wash in, air you breathe, food you eat, medicines you take, etc. Almost everything you can think of the author says is bad for you. The author spends most of the book repeating him-self over and over. He advises everybody to stop taking all drugs and stop seeing doctors. When the book finally gets to how to treat yourself "naturally" the author directs you to sign up for his web site.   There is one especially ridiculous section in the book. The author says he knows a natural healer who has a special machine which keeps you balanced. The machine can monitor you 24/7 and rebalance you even when you're somewhere else.   My whole life I have been very weary of doctors and the pills they hand out. Doctors have made me sicker than helped me. The problem is that the author says that everyone should stop going to doctors and stop taking medications. There are a lot of people I know with cancer, aids, muscular dystrophy, parkinsons disease that would die or get very ill if they stopped taking their medications. 
 I bought this book because I read other customers' good review comments.  I have to say "Don't buy it"!  The book is only introduce you some simple procedures on how to take a test.  With your common sense, you will be able to tell your child all about it.  Plus, the price is really a rob.  ...  I was fooled.  I hope you won't 
 I bought this book to brush up on my crewel work.  I found the pictures and explanations of the stitches quite poor. One stitch I have forgotten and cannot remember it by the lack of detail in the instructions.  Also, many stitches are missing,a beginner should look for a better book. The pictures of completed works are very nice and once you learn the stitches should be easy for a beginner.  This part is worth the price of the book 
 I read most of the reviews on here and I also read enough reviews on other sites, including Mercola's to get an idea of what this book is about.  When anybody says "Don't Eat This..[ insert a natural food here ] " I tend to go hum-..  Grains as well as seeds, nuts, vegetables and fruits, animal flesh, have been around since the beginning of man.  The problem is, the industrial revolution allowed people to over consume all types of foods.  We became gluttons by our own devices which set in motion this belief system that huge meals are the norm. That is so, totally wrong!  In our past, and in many poor countries today, people walk around and pick berries, hand-harvest grains, kill their own meat and so on.  People ate smaller because things had to last longer and their weren't machines to supply foods to grocery store shelves so we could stuff or faces at all hours of the day.  I believe even a natural food source if eaten in excess can have some negative consequences.  Did you know that cruciferous vegetables like broccoli when eaten raw and in excess can block thyroid function? Who knew that something so good for us, when eaten in excess could be so bad for us. BUT this does not mean that natural, wholesome foods should be totally eliminated from our diet.  A portion of grain is about the size of your clenched fist, but how many Americans eat just that amount?  The problem is not eliminating grains, but eliminating over consumption and living by portion control.   I read a review on here from a doctor who claims that a vegetarian diet is the most healthiest.  Don't believe that folks.  Vegetables are extremely healthy for us, but not exclusively. I was a vegetarian for almost 10 years and I was not at my healthiest.  Most of the vegetarian groups and friends I knew were also skinny and sort of gaunt looking. It was only when I started eating a balanced diet including some animal foods AND high in vegetables, did I start to feel and look better.  Living long and being healthy is not rocket science...  - Eat lots of vegetables, include raw and raw juices. (lightly steam cruciferous vegetables to deactivate the thyroid-hampering properties) - Organic, raw fruits. - Nuts and seeds (raw), grains, legumes. - Organic chicken & wild salmon. Organic beef 1-2 times a week at the most, (if you like beef that is) - Plenty of fresh, clean water - Most important, PORTION CONTROL!  - Cardio vascular and weight-resistance exercise each day. If you don't use it, you'll loose it! - Quality sleep. 6-10 hours a day, depending upon the quality of your sleep and physical needs. - Avoid stress as much as possible. - Stay away from cane sugar, salt, tans-fats (hydrogenated oils), and junk foods, white flour products. - Avoid all types of alcohol.  - Don't smoke and avoid second-hand smoke. Yes this includes cigars and chewing tobacco.   The reason people have such a hard time with food and diets is the fact that they don't understand and live by portion control.  For example see how many of these do you over eat...  A portion of nuts is about 5-10. How many of you have eaten handfuls? A portion of fruit is one small apple (not the huge softball sized red delicious type). Berries about a handful. A portion of grains is about 4 heaping spoonfuls or the size of your fist.  How many of you eat a huge bowl of cereal? or eat all that bread, or tortilla chips at restaurants before the meal is served? A portion of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.  That is pretty small by American standards.  How many of you are a glutton at BBQ's? or eat those big slabs of steak they serve at restaurants? - That 'aint a portion folks! How many of you go to All-You-Can-Eat restaurants?     The Standard American Diet, stands for S.A.D. And sad it is. It's no wonder so many people are over weight and sick.  The key is-.. moderation, diversity (i.e. nutrient diversity), staying away from junk food, and most important... Portion control of our meals.

 While the book was plentiful of wild, sensual fantasies, I was disappointed in some of them.  Many were hard to believe even for fantasies and many sounded like they were written by illiterates.  If you're looking  for this type of book, I strongly recommend "Women on Top" 
 michelle zacharias , i totally agree with you. I can believe the ruined such a good movie qith such a terrible ending, Im looking for the hollywood version as well, for I think that jacqes should have learnt the lesson with enzos suicide and value life, especially when he is going to have a child from the beautifull woman he loves 
 The suction on these bowls is so weak that the baby pulled it off the highchair and dumped the contents in a few seconds flat.  They do come in lovely colors, though 
 An EXACT copy of Ang Lee's wonderful "Eat Drink Man Woman".  Frankly what annoyed me here was I watched this one first.. I just finished watching Eat Drink.. it took me about 15 minutes to realize I was watching an exact copy of something I'd already seen a couple years ago. Anyway, I was annoyed because while I could predict events in Eat Drink because I'd seen Tortilla Soup, Eat Drink was clearly the better movie -- so unfortunately it spoiled some of the pleasure of Eat Drink for me.

 The Altenitive Music scene is always dissing on hardcore, and how they say its too diverse from everything else, its too loud its disturbing for the ears, and It's mindless. Some of these things I do not deny, such as it being loud and different. Thats hardcore for you, Its loud music being pushed to its musical boundries. Bands like Botch, Norma Jean, Converge, Rmembering never, Zao, and The locust are all bands that show just that. Bands like Terror, With their mindless Drop-d guitar hooks, their boring 4/4 signitures, cleice' lyrics, and most of all horible vocals give Hardcore the title of being Mindless Headbanger music. Terror, do yourselves a favor and stop writing a music. Just watch what the real haedcore scene is doing 
 Disappointed!  There is nothing new in this book that I haven't seen on T.V. or elsewhere.  Warmed over advice 
 I was looking for more information.  Thought it was over priced for what I got 
 Absolutely terrible. The most inexplicable comedy phenomena this side of Dane Cook.   Nothing happens in this movie (and I mean nothing) except a bunch of sullen characters exhanging "comic" glances and looking withdrawn and cynical. I don't think a Soviet run production company could suck the life and charisma out of these talented actors better. So on that point it's a success. All the sullen, understated lines and glances are supposed to be funny-they're not, they're boring. Somebody needs to tell Wes Anderson that too. ASAP 
 Early in the text Cashdan makes clear the fact that fairy tales were never intended as children's stories, nor were they meant to convey lessons. Rather, they were a source of entertainment and adventure for adults - characteristics that made the same stories viable later to be adapted for children. He asserts that, rather than teaching specific moral lessons, fairy tales do help children learn to deal with the struggles of everyday life, particularly struggles with what he terms "the seven deadly sins of childhood:" vanity, gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, lust, and deceit. He asserts that the tales teach children through subtle means to resolve "struggles between the positive and negative forces in the self."   Cashdan characterizes the witch-villain as an external manifestation and magnification of the child-hero/ine's inner flaws. Later he states that good and bad female figures relate to the child's positive and negative experiences with the mother figure in her life (never addressing the fact that the good mother is almost always dead or absent in the stories). Cashdan quickly dismisses the possibility of misogyny in the negative portrayal of stepmothers and female villains simply  because fairy tales aren't meant to be taken as faithfully realistic.   Later still he returns to the idea of the witch as representative of the hero/ine's sinful characteristics. The primary premise of his text is that the "Witch must die because the witch embodies the sinful parts of the self." This concept reinforces the patriarchal implication that evil is feminine in nature and suggests that it is the "negative" female aspects of the child's character which must be annihilated in order for her to live happily ever after.   Cashdan also claims that witches in fairy tales are often depicted as cannibalistic in order to identify them as fully repugnant and therefore deserving of annihilation; in fact, cannibalism was perceived as an earmark of witchcraft during the European witch hunts. This simple statement (as well as his flaccid bibliography) betrays the fact that Cashdan's text is poorly researched and that he often substitutes speculation for informed observations. Due to its inherent inconsistencies and oversights, Cashdan's text is utterly useless unless to provide points to argue against 
 I would not recommend this product for anyone over 3 & 1/2 years (unless small for their age).  My 4 yr old son (36lbs) got it for his birthday, and broke the steering wheel within 10 minutes.  There is plenty of room for him on the seat and inside the car, but its been "parked" since broken.  I wish we would have spent the money on something that would have lasted.  The plastic seems cheaply made.  The voice buttons and noises are loud and work well.  Stickers have already started to flake/peel off after 1 month.  Consider a bigwheel 
 Maybe I loved the original one too much, but this version of the story did not work for me. I especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas. Stick with the first one. It was perfect 
 I am a horrible but determined artist. I have enjoyed the "How to Draw 50..." series since I was very young. However, this particular book is not helpful: majority of the drawings are far too intricate to follow, most of them are unknown plants and flowers, and it fails to teach something.  Unlike the "How to Draw 50 Athletes" this book doesn't have a goal, other than to instruct you on how to mimic some plants and flowers. Whereas, after going through the "Draw 50 Athletes," I learned how to draw the human body; the muscles, head features, proportions, and how they moved.   This book is not for beginners I assure you of this. I understand nature is harder to recognize and capture, but the book just was too difficult to follow, I was only capable of drawing 12 of the 50, and I do each one many times, and I still showed no improvement.  It's just not worth owning. You won't learn anything, and you wont enjoy the process of drawing the plants and flowers. I promise.  In My Humble Opinion John G (Who am I)

 I really didnt find answers to anything regarding the meaning or essence of money.  Only the authors confused philosophy.  He is obviously brought up in a Jewish household which holds money tantamount to the highest esteem one can get from life.  Money is an energy, nothing more.  I dont want to hear anymore neurotic ramblings on about this subject from this guy 
 Before this misguided book was published, DDT was successfully reducing malaria deaths across the globe.  After it, and the subsequent ban on DDT, millions of people have suffered and died needlessly.  For example, in Sri Lanka in 1948, there were 2.8 million malaria cases and 7,300 malaria deaths. With widespread DDT use, malaria cases fell to 17 and no deaths in 1963. After DDT use was discontinued, Sri Lankan malaria cases rose to 2.5 million in the years 1968 and 1969, and the disease remains a killer in Sri Lanka today.  Carson' science is dodgy, her conclusions false and her prescriptions plain wrong.  Do not buy this boo 
 Before buying this book you have to realise this is merely an exercise book. The amount of explanation or theory is extremely limited. And neither they elaborate on the student examples they chose for their book. Nor do they explain why some solutions might be better than others. The exercises itself could be more challenging, they really seem to be aimed at first year students. You will have to buy at least a book on graphic design principles/theory to put the exercises in this book into the right context. Nothing wrong with that, but they 'forgot' to mention all that on the back cover, so to speak. It's a nice idea, but its execution is flawed and way too limited to be the stroke of genious that some reviewers want you to believe 
 I know I was supposed to find Jim Lynch's debut novel, "The Highest Tide," wonderous(!), and magical(!) and mystical(!).  Surely, the diminutive precocious hero of the book, young Miles O'Malley (who has a particular knack for finding odd sea life on his late night strolls along the beach of the Puget Sound) is irresistible(!), and inspirational(!).  As you can tell from my sarcasm, none of it really worked for me.  It's not that I really despised the book -- it's just that I don't like when an author tries to awe me on every other page.  By about the middle of the book, I started getting pretty bored with not only Miles, but also with his rough-around-the-edges air guitar playing side-kick, Phelps; the totally messed up love of his life, Angie; and his best friend, the elderly, new age spouting, prophetic, Florence.  The last described character especially annoyed me, in the way her off the wall predictions always came true.  I guess we have to trust the author's depiction about the sea-life that he describes.  I don't know about you, but I'm not about to start researching the sex lives of barnacles, clams and mussels for verification purposes.  Although, I admit it would be kind of neat to find a giant squid washed up on the beach.   
 "Belle de Jour" is widely acclaimed as a masterpiece. I would like to know: by whom? Certainly by nobody with high self-esteem. If art's highest purpose is to project life as it ought to be, then, according to this film's creators, life ought to be seen as dispensable, drab, meaningless, and amoral. What is virtue? "Belle de Jour" doesn't know and doesn't care. What is coherent plot and characterization? "Belle de Jour" puts on a blindfold and pins a tale on neither. What sort of role best suits a stunningly beautiful actress? "Belle de Jour" says let's stick Catherine Deneuve in a pillory of an ugly, thankless role and spit at her as a self-loathing, self-deluded prostitute. What is "Belle de Jour"? Worthless 
 Donald Fegan was an extremely talented musician.  I absolutely loved both of his older solo albums, as well as all of his work under the name "Steely Dan".  The way his music flowed was unbeleivable.  Morph the cat does not sound anything like any of his previous work.  Every time you think that you get the flow of the song, he throws you a curve ball.  You cannot enjoy this music simply by hearing it, and if you listen to it you get bored by repeating lyrics.  Some of the songs were okay, such as "Mary shut the garden door", "What I do", and especially "Morph the cat", but do not expect to hear the old Dan.  I do intend on listening to the album through several (more) times, in order to give it more of a fair chance (although "IGY" and "Trans Island Skyway" sucked me in so that I couldn's have turned it off if I tried.)  If I decide that I like the album, I will post another review, but I don't think that that is likely to occur.  If you are a fan as I am, I strongly suggest that you don't buy this album, not to save the money, but to save the memory 
 As a person who loves the dating/relationship genre, let me assure you that there are MUCH better books out there.  This book repackages the techniques usually recommended to salesmen--mirroring the other person in order to build rapport, and "speaking in their language."  And that's exactly what you'll be doing--selling a falsified version of yourself in a marginally effective and pretty awkward way.  (In spite of her exuberantly triumphant intro, Tracy Cabot is now divorced.  I imagine it was hard to sustain this manufactured "bond" for very long.)    If you really want to learn about love languages, "The Five Love Languages" by Gary Chapman is much better.  It will teach you how to truly interpret and sincerely relate to expressions of love between you and your boyfriend/girlfriend/partner.  And if you want to make a man fall in love with you, "Why Men Love Bitches" by Sherry Argov is hands-down the best.  It takes the also-fabulous prinicples behind "The Rules" (which have worked for me beautifully) and makes them practicable for the modern and/or professional woman.  (I highly recommend The Rules--loosely interpreted--as well).  You can read any of these books in 2-3 hours.  I have read the latter two more times than I can count.  If after reading Why Men Love Bitches and The Rules, you haven't solved your dating problems, you probably need to read "He's Just Not That Into You"--which is not about dating as much as it is about recognizing the excuses women make for men when the truth isn't what we want.  (Gems include "No, he's not too busy to call you.  Calling you takes less time than going to the bathroom.  If he's into you, calling you is the bright moment in his otherwise busy day.")  This should definitely help build the correct mentality for expecting--and getting--both interest and great treatment from men.  And, finally, "What Southern Women Know About Flirting" has some tips and ideas that will help anyone, but particularly those inclined to play the "Damsel in Distress" card.  This one's just the icing on the cake 
 McKnight's concerns about communities' dependency on professional assistance are legitimate, but disturbingly overstated in this book.     In the end I felt McKnight's trashing of the already well-trodden government provision of social services may not be altogether helpful to distressed communities.  He sidesteps concerns of capital mobility and exploitation and the pernicious effects wrought by years of discrimination.  Any debate over when and where and how social programs can be effective is cast aside as well, since in McKnight's picture, social programs and the professional service providers are, in fact, the vilains and culprits for most of what ails society.    One of the damaging fallacies that seems to be perpetuated in this book is that service professionals are not able to be both professional and caring - the two are deemed mutually incompatible.  Mcknights views resonate with employers' caring rhetoric - conveniently invoked every time a healthcare worker tries to claim she does care about patients but is still entitled to a living wage or, perhaps, health insurance.     What is further implied is that communities will readily and ably take up the reign of providing for themselves and their members when denied more institutionalized professional services.  It seems implied that communities had no problems before the social programs to solve them came into being.  In this, I think I see McKnight is invokeing an idealized notion of an society at an earlier time; maybe his argument would have seemed more reasoble in a time when families were less geographically mobile and may have constituted an economic unit, when the elderly lived shorter lives and were less numerous themselves with more children to care for them, and the local economic activities were more functionally interdependent.    But McKnight's model for today's cure doesn't seem to fit today's conditions.  On the other hand, McKnights solutions may be the only ones available in a society where budget cuts and elimination of social services seem the prevailing trend.

 Purchased for a Summer Reading requirement for my son for school he said "it was verry boring" 
 Let me start off by saying that if you haven't read any of Gerritsen's books featuring her two main characters, don't even consider reading this book. So much about the characters deeply depends on your being familiar with their history. Even if you have read other books with these characters, The Mephisto Club, while starting off with a lot of suspense, is a disappointment. The plot drags and requires you to suspend belief way too much, there are too many subplots that are left dangling, and the ending -- what there is of one -- is weak and unsatisfying. All in all, I'd advise you to skip The Mephisto Club. Your time and money are too valuable to spend on a book that, at best, is mediocre 
 Now, don't think of me as another person debating over whom is better, Biggie or 2Pac, because it's not like that. The reason why I'm bringing up Pac in my review for Biggie's Duets album is that there's a difference between his and Biggie's posthumous albums. That is, Tupac had a huge catalog of unreleased material left over after his passing; Biggie didn't. All the songs on here are verses that we've all heard already from either Biggie's first two albums or from his guest appearances on other people's albums. Thus, this is really a remix album disguised as a regular album. Get it?  And as my brother said, the most irritating thing about this album (aside from the fact that "duet" means two people) is how the songs are constructed around these old Biggie verses. It's hard to say what the worst songs are, but I'll have to go with "Mi Casa" (with R. Kelly and Charlie Wilson) and the badly produced rap/rock song "Wake Up" (featuring Korn). "Nasty Girl" is also pretty cheesy, and speaking of that, if Biggie was alive, I seriously doubt he'd be collaborating with Nelly, or some of these other average emcees like Boyz N Da Hood ("Hustler's Story") or especially Jim Jones (see "I'm With Whateva" -- but actually, Biggie's not even in that song, so I don't know if that really counts).  Another annoying thing is the way Diddy tries to change the meanings of some of these songs. The aforementioned "Nasty Girl" was originally "Nasty Boy", and now it just seems to be a club anthem about nothing. And "What's Beef" has transformed into "Beef", with Diddy yelling at the end, "Beef doesn't not happen on records. You don't KNOW what beef is!" Apparently, HE doesn't know, or he forgot.  While ALL the guest stars' verses don't necessarily fall short, the only really interesting parts of this whole album are the testimonies from Voletta Wallace and Biggie's kids. And I'm not really surprised by the four and five-star reviews for this album because, not to be funny, but I think that if an album came out called The Notorious B.I.G. Sings Sinatra, those people would give THAT a high rating too. Anyway, I'm a fan of Biggie too, but continually reusing his verses is not the way to preserve his legacy, so...Diddy? It's time to quit.  Anthony Ruper 
 The bottom line: I really didn't like this book. I found the plot and action to be very slow moving and uninteresting. One thing I did like was Sheriff Brady. I thought she was a good solidly created character, but the plot just didn't have that exciting pace that a Hoag, Hooper, Johansen, or Cornwell novel does. Another thing that I didn't particulary care for was the whole eagle thing with the young girl. It kind of a gave off a somewhat ridiculous indian spirit kind of feeling. I also found it kind of unnecessary to have the part about Joanna's neighbor's death and his daughter. Of course if you are a fan of J.A. Jance, then I'm sure you'll like "The Devil's Claw" and these kind of "small town" mysteries. If you enjoy more hard-core suspense and don't like the "country down south" novels, then you won't like "The Devil's Claw 
 I automatically deduct 2 stars from a cookbook with no pictures.  Other than that it is pretty good 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere.

 Linda Ashcroft crafted a well-written book of fiction. The dates she claims to have been with Morrison have been publicly proven as inaccurate. She was sued by the Morrison family when the book was first published in Europe and she lost the case, 3/4ths of her advance money and the book was pulled from the shelves. When the book was edited and published in the US, it was proven she did not know Jim and she again lost her advance money and her publishing company canceled her book tour and refused to do any promotion. It would be a great book if she just published it for what it is...fiction. 
 We have to do better than this for our children. Controlling and turning your kid into the perfect little, well behaved lemming is going to haunt you until you die. This type of abuse never has a good, long term effect on anyone. Put the paddles and belts down and talk to your kids. They deserve at least that much. 
 It's great to see the author writing customer reviews of their own book?  Turned me off from buying the book.  How stupid does she think people are 
 If you've ever seen a David DeCouteau movie (Brotherood, Leeches, Werewolves of New York) you know what to expect:  a homoerotic mishmash of ridiculous plotting, hunky boys in skimpy underwear; and relentless padding consisting of slow motion swaggering and lots of pecs and abs.  In RING OF DARKNESS, Adrienne Barbeau (Swamp Thing, Fog, Creepshow, Maude) plays the boy band's seductive manager who stages an audition to replace the band's lead singer who tried to leave them after he found out what the boys in the band were in reality.  Barbeau does well as always, but the rest of the insanely attractive cast needs acting lessons badly.  By the time you've figured out just what these hunks do to keep their looks, you've had to sit through some pretty derivative plotting and a predictably campy ending.  DeCouteau needs to rethink his future projects and at least come up with more than just pretty bods 
 I was looking for the classic tale of Frog meets Princess and mistakenly picked up this book.  Dreadful.  First, although we have liked James Marshall's artwork elsewhere, there's nothing special here.  The drawings are simple and generally uninspired.  Second.  Who thought a rewrite with the princess slamming the frog against the wall was a good idea?!?  Not us.  In fact, my husband nixed the idea of reading this to our small children after he gave it a preliminary perusal.  From the book:  That made the princess very  angry. She picked up the frog, and  she threw him against the wall! But when he fell to the  floor; the frog was no longer  a frog.  Note that there is no explanation of why this outburst led to the witches spell being broken.  [Perhaps we should slam each other around to see if there's a prince or princess hiding within--lol]  Two Stars.  So-so art.  Not true to the original tale.  
 Unless you know nothing about Jefferson and the period of American history in which he figured, don't think about buying this book.  Don't even think of borrowing from local library.  This is a rehash that could pass as a high school review book.  And the writing?  Well, bad writing, I think, always reveals the shallowness of perception.  Example: Bernstein's Introduction begins with the epitaph on Jefferson's cemetary stone; Bernstein  follows through with a few observations and then writes:  "In life, Jefferson never found the quiet that surrounds him in death." And who does?  The rest of the book is even worse.  I wonder how books like this get past the first gate.  It should never have been published.  It's certainly not worth a glance 
 I have all her other cds I especially love Unsung Heroes there is a vibe to that cd that gets u right in but with this one its like shes just tryin far toooo hard to be good....Sure the technique is spot on but THERE IS NO SOUL the emotion is missing...for me I like my jazz vocals with feeling. I like the singer to take u on a journey deep into to the song. u wont get that here all u will get is technique.. 
 An excellent story ruined by the WORST binding effort I have ever seen.  The book literally fell to pieces in my hand after only a few pages.  I guess it says something about the story that I even bothered to fight to the end of it.  No chance of a re-read. Unless you're willing to deal with loose 25 page sections, I would just look for a copy at the library.  It will not survive to become part of your collection 
 Greetings to one and all.  Just wanted you to know that if you are looking for a pretty good film called "The Desperate Hours," this is NOT the one you want to watch. You want to watch the 1955 version with Humphrey Bogart and Fredric March. This is the 1990 "remake" with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins. The original is a taunt drama in which a man discovers that his home has been invaded and his family taken hostage by a trio of gangster escaped from prison and focuses on his desperate attempts to save their lives. This remake is exercise in terror in which the sadistic violence of the criminals becomes the driving force of the story and the goal is to see how far they will go before they are finally stopped. On paper you would have thought Anthony Hopkins could do a marvelous job in the role of the father, but the script pretty much makes that impossible. Turning the bad guy into a major league psychotic just destroys the psychological chess game that made the original so compelling. Rourke is simply the wrong choice for the role, always coming across as a sick punk rather than a criminal menace, but then few actors are going to be able to play against Hopkins, even when he is in low gear. I cannot believe anybody would watch this film twice; I only watched it because I was interested to see how they updated the original, the ending of which I just watched again on television. Of course the ending would be more violent, but it was the elegance of the ending of the original, as the hero saves his family with an unloaded gun, that made it stand out. This one is just a splatter flick dressed up a bit to fool you. Go check out the original because like Rourke's character, you do not want this in your house anywhere near your family 
 I wouldn't purchase this title. Afi has said several times that they had no imput into this album, that it was ONLY a Nitro Retrospective, and that they didn't really want it made 
 When I played the first composition on this CD, I started thinking that  perhaps I had purchased a really stellar CD because the first song was  really jumping. But after that, this CD is disapointing to me. There are  maybe three pretty good compositions with the rest being totally  unmemorable. With the three good cuts from this disc and a few from her  first CD, Joyce Cooling could have made one good CD. But, in my opinion,  there aren't enough good songs here to warrant a release of this CD. Joyce  certainly has potential, but she needs to work on her creativity. She sound  here like an artist still maturing in style 
 This wasn't such a bad novel, and I kind of enjoyed it.  Not great, but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly.  However, the ending really killed it for me.  It's too unnecessarily long.  Once the major conflict is resolved, the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah.  I wish I'd just put the book down after the rain because I would've left with a feeling of at least entertainment.  But after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications, only pages of explanations, I just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book.  Would've been three stars if it'd just known when to end 
 I did not find this book helpful.  I feel that the fashion tips are ridiculous for plus size women. Checks, bright colors and huge caftan type clothing are certainly not flattering. I am a plus size and I would never wear any of the selections found in this book. They are loud, loose and make the model look like she even heavier than she is. I found Sandra Betzina's books, especially Power Sewing, to be much more detailed and helpful. The sewing techniques in this book are certainly not couture in my opinion. The techniques are quick, but the results are a home-made look and the fit is poor. The waistline techniques are amatuer at best. My skills are on the intermediate level and I did not gain any helpful information from this book. Having found better selections in the Sandra Betzina line of patterns and books, I gave this book away, because there is nothing I found in it that I consider worth my time. 
 I began this book knowing nothing about Persia aside from the brief mention everyone gets in Western Civ.  I now know next to nothing.  In all fairness, it is not the author's fault entirely. The book is well-written, but spans so great a period of time - rather important cultural beginnings and whatnot - that no one incident, subject or aspect of Persian culture and society is truly adequately treated.  I would suggest this as the start for someone who thinks he might have an interest to pinpoint areas for further study.  But, check it out of the library 
 I'll admit, I am a bit new to power Linux but I consider myself competent. The essential problem with the book is Jeff tries to present examples without any background or information. In chapter 3, the book jumps right into configuring UML from the host using 'uml_mconsole' withot telling the reader where to get it or how to compile it. This coupled with the lack of web resources associated with the book, makes it very hard to keep rolling with lessons.   Another example is the use of tap interfaces. tap interfaces don't just automagically appear when you start a linux box, they must be configured. Jeff makes no attempt to eductate the user on how to accomplish this and has no resource to go to for help.  I am using CentOS4 with kernel 2.6.9-34. Perhaps not the most up-to-date version but it should be adequate. I would have expected to find some pointers to usable kernels and root filesystems with which to experiment. Instead I find I spend most of my time fetching kernels and packages and building what I need, not by instruction in the book, but by info found through a Google search.  Who edited this book anyway? Did you even bother to try some of the "lessons" Jeff provided. I don't care that Jeff created UML, he doesn't hack it as an author. Spend your money on hookers and booze, the experience will certainly be more satisfying 
 This musician, if you can call him that, should be embarrassed.  If he has something to say, more people would listen if he didn't use such vulgar language and stopped talking about his body parts.  I won't be buying this and my kids won't either.  Repulsive 
   Okay, Ginger Snaps one has become one of my all time favorite horror films. I loved the first one,but I dont understand how people can say the sequel is just as good as the first. I had some problems with this movie. First, there were some plot holes actually there was alot of plot holes (who the hell was the wolf chasing her? Was it Sam from the first Ginger Snaps?). But my biggest problem was, im not even sure.It was boring and not that interesting.We dont even get to see Bridgette cause mayhem as a wolf.Ghost is really annoying to watch in the film and well i just didnt like this one. I dont understand what people loved aboput this film.The only thing that kept me interested was the fact that its Bridgett and actually Ginger Snaps.I love the sisters characters.But this film just wasnt all that good at all. I still yet have to watch "The Beginning",and since its much more expensive hopefully its better 
 In short, this cd is half good and half crap.  The cd starts strong with catchy guitar, and the obvious sharp synth parts.  The thing that gets me is this bands over popularity with a genre of music that has been around for over 25 years. Frontman Brandon Flowers complains about other successful new wave/postgarage bands success (The Bravery, The Fever, Bloc Party, Moving Units) and that they are "riding on our success".  Meanwhile the Killers go on tour with Depeche Mode after they reach platinum status and for some reason Flowers doesn't take a hint.  He has simply become the Depeche Mode of 2004-whenever this band breaks up (cuz they should). Unfortunately this band has a lot less talent than Depeche Mode, seeing as how Flowers voice is overly futzed with in mastering and he uses a pitch corrector in concert. Plus half their cd sucks and their new cd isn't sounding much better. The new single is awful. Quite terrible.  Now I know this review will get a bunch of thumbs down, but I know that those will be from people who have listened to each single on the radio and know nothing about real music, music history, or probably even how to play an instrument, so it won't bother me.   If you want real new wave alternative rock check out these bands: The Bravery Kaiser Chiefs Moving Units Bloc Party The Fever The Unicorns Wolf Parade The Dove 
 The Koran--or, the Qur'an (the recitation) as the Arabs call it--is believed by Muslims and diehard sheeple/believers to be the literal word of God as recited through Gabriel to Mohammed. However, the Koran--as demonstrated no better than in this post-911 world of incremented Muslim terrorism--has many, irreparable faults within, the chief one being that it's susceptible for the use of encouraging violence, brutality and terrorism!!!! There's a reason Osama is, sacrilegiously, a very popular name these days in the Muslim community and why the Muslim world in general scarcely protests against terrorism, or the extremists they claim only make up a "fraction" of their worshippers. The ordeal with Islam is that a larger-than-tolerable number of their practitioners believe that violence is essentially Islamic and Islamic terrorism is only religious terrorism and therefore true Islam. Aside from these already inexcusable sins of the Koran, there are also irrecoverable problems relating to misuse of science, inconsistency, historical inaccuracy and a failure of providing context for verses.   Because of all these flaws within the Koran, it's hazardously susceptible to misinterpretation by Islamic fascists and terrorists, something the Christian Bible, as an example, obviously isn't. That's why Christianity hasn't produced any extremists or fanatics who use the name of their God to kill, murder, dictate, terrorize, or otherwise harm other human beings.   The most infernal predicament with the Koran, not just extremist Islam, is that some of its own verses glorify and preach violence (leading to terrorism). One of the most infamous verses in the Koran appears to shamelessly endorse brutality, (2:194):   "The Sacred month for the sacred month and all sacred things are (under the law of) retaliation; whoever then acts aggressively against you, inflict injury on him according to the injury he has inflicted on you and be careful (of your duty) to Allah and know that Allah is with those who guard (against evil)."   This provocative verse glaringly endorses a revenge culture which, of course, dominates the minds of the Islamic terrorists who hate the West. The same sura where the above verse is featured also endorses that fighting for Allah isn't optional (2:216). Other verses implicating Islam as the opposite of the "religion of peace" include verse 4:95--which says that those who fight please Allah more than those who don't--and verse 9:19-20--which says that those who take up arms for Islam rank highest among believers!!!! The call to terrorism and violence in Koranic verses is by no means limited to these; these are just a couple of examples.   Another direly distressing feature of the Koran is its moral backsliding as practiced by Mohammed, which is a moral relapse based on the moral traditions of Judaism and Christianity and also just basic conscience. For instance, the Koran unabashedly and explicitly encourages supposedly "light" beatings to disobedient wives, with even Islamic scholars generally agreeing on this interpretation of verse 4:34. For the Muslim apologists in obstinate denial over Mohammed's endorsement of domestic violence and spousal abuse, the verse goes henceforth:   "Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because God has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what God would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) beat them (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For God is Most High, great (above you all)."   By this staggeringly disquieting verse, we can see that amoral backsliding is advocated in the Koran; Judaism and Christianity have no such call to battery.   Other irremediably terminal dilemmas with Islam concern the intractable punishment of death for apostasy, the rejection of Islam by a believer; the stoning-to-death of adulterers, particularly women; the advocation of cutting off the hands of thieves; the death penalty for homosexuals; and permitting/advocating slavery. Islam has no defense against the charge it condones slavery since the "best" Islamo-apologists like John Esposito and Yusuf Ali do is admit Islam permits slavery, but also the "good treatment" of slaves!!!!   Aside from these morally distasteful encroachments by the Koran, it's also infected with historical irregularities versus what the Bible contains, but the arrogant Muslim believers justify this by denouncing the Bible as being blurred by human interference, which presumes the perfection of the Qoran. The science misused in the Koran is also unpardonable--confirming its primitive sickness--as some verses literally bait the reader into thinking the Earth is flat and that the moon gives off light instead of reflecting sunlight!   With all these irretrievably baneful ordeals in the Koran, it's no wonder that former jihadists like Walid Shoebat have had to RENOUNCE Islam and convert to Christianity to leave terrorism behind!!!! With all this putridness in the Koran, no hardline Muslim could become moderate!!!!   
 First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book 
 A weak story line and a confusing plot ensured that I was complete lost somewhere in the middle of Jamica in the first few chapters.Was disappointing to read this work of Ludlum, who otherwise has had an untarnished reputation so far 
 This product did not live up to Jonahan's "claims" on the bottle. I cannot even begin to describe how bad it was and how it did not work nor live up to his promise 
 This archly coy wanna-be was replete with a number of errors that any halfway decent historical novelist should have caught. The Season starts in March, so people are returning to London then, NOT leaving it. And a woman being the victim of a would-be fiance's amnesia is NOT grounds for denying her vouchers to Almack's. People married younger in those days, but for the Darcy twins to say they had 17 year old friends who were already married a year? Mr. Gardiner was Mrs. Bennet's BROTHER, NOT her UNCLE! Nor was he "in trade", per se; he was a solicitor. Has this woman even READ Pride & Prejudice, or just the Cliff Notes (tm)? And those are just for starters. Badly contrived and far too derivative of what the author thinks the original was 
 This is a classical sample of deceptive literature      common in the last  50 years. The life of the Holy Prophet is protrayed in a way to palacate  the uninformed in Islam that he is also a prophet apart from himself as  known to the billions who follow his hadiths. The writer is a modern  crusader and is merely potraying the Holy prophet to both the  unsuspectingly non-believer and illiterate Muslims.  The author himself  strictly speaking is not a proponent of Haddith and belonged to a  neo-colonial religious movement known as Qadiani which has since the  gaining of independence by the Indian sub-continent has been exposed as a  non-muslim movement. Inbetween the message, author Muhammad Ali proposed a  general shift by Muslims from their adherence to the Haddith of the Holy  Prophet to the new social order advanced by the prophet of Qadiani the  Mirza Ghulam Ahmedi. -bi 
 Two words -- No resolution.  Seriously, this graphic novel ends with no plot resolution at all.  There is such a great buildup with absolutely no payoff.  Do NOT waste your money on this.  The only redeeming factor is the decent artwork.  Beyond that, the storyline is atrocious 
 If you are looking for the novel, this isn't it.  The description does not indicate that this is nothing more than a fancy comic book.  I bought vol 1-3, returned all with a complaint, Amazon reordered for me and sent me the same thing again.  Finally got the novels from B&N for less.  Don't waste your money 
 I bought this (luckily, used) based on the excellent reader reviews I read here on Amazon.  I could not have been more misled.  This is one of the worst self-improvement books I have ever read. It is bad beyond anything I could have expected, so bad that had I not gotten my hopes up for a good read with some good advice, I probably would have fallen out of my recliner laughing.  This book is a very thin gruel of other writers' ideas, dumbed down for the sort of reader who finds literary satisfaction in  romance novels. The substance of this book is nothing more than "If you write down what you want--and keep writing it down, if necessary--you'll get it."  Hmmm.    "Hmmm" is right.    Hardly anyone these days isn't familiar with the earlier New Age incarnation of this idea--writing affirmations--and anyone who has read the writings of the Founding Fathers of motivational self-improvement (like Napoleon Hill) has seen it as well.  Far, far too much of this book consists of anecdotes.  The anecdotes range in their effect from soporific to nauseating.  Take "Gloria's" story, for example.  An entire chapter is devoted to Gloria's search for love, for a husband.  She writes letters to a "soul mate" that she has not yet met.  Among her puerile love-maunderings, she writes a description of the soul mate she hopes to meet:  He is a "beautiful" dresser, and has "Strong hands, deep integrity, and spiritual truth," and a gift for "making and having money." She doesn't want the money because she's high maintenance and loves to spend; no, she wants the money "for the joy, love, peace, and bounty it can bring the world."  (Uh, yeah, sure Gloria.  Clearly you're one of those unfortuate individuals who believes her own bs.)  After two years of writing this sort of pabulum to herself, Gloria goes to a bar, gets picked up by a lawyer, and marries him 11 months later. As we all know, lawyers typically possess exactly the sorts of qualities she was looking for in a soul mate, so this outcome is hardly surprising....  The book doesn't get any better than this, and there is even a short chapter at the end of the book to help you rationalize the failure of the techniques (for lack of a better word) described between the interminable anecdotes.    Most importantly, the advice simply doesn't work.  This book really is a silly piece of nonsense.  Skip it. 
 I was really looking forward to reading this book after seeing such stellar critics reviews. But I found the book predictable and dull and rushing for it to be done with so I could move on to something else (I have a hard time not finishing a book, no matter how uninteresting it is). This is the first book I've read by Rendell and have no desire to read anything else by her. I felt as if I was reading a completely different book from the one that was reviewed. I had no interest in what happened to Mix, Gwen, Nerissa, Otto, or anyone else 
 Upon arrival the computer was screwed up and wouldn't work.  Called Schwinn and they wanted me to go out and buy an expensive set of specialized tools and fix it myself.  Yeah, right!  I made them send out a repairman.  Three weeks later, I had a working bike.  While working, this bike is excellent, I must admit.  However, less than two months later while riding, all resistance disapperared and  I got the same error sign on the console.  I never took the bike over level three and rode three times a week for 30 minutes, not exactly a heavy workload for an exercise bike.  Back came the repairman, who promised it back to me in a week.  It is now six weeks later, and still no bike.  $349. is a lot to pay for a bike that only works for two months 
 the subject is not an exaggeration, unless you are a mother this book is the biggest drag i've ever come across.  Franky this, Franky that, it's so repetitive, predictable and juvenile.  soooooo tacky, such a week and dwindling plot words cannot describe, this is the "gili" of the literary world.  I hope to sway at least one person from buying this book, just so my purchase will be justified 
 I must confess that this book was not a pleasure to read.  The trivia portrayed in the Roosevelt-Churchill relationship was at times interesting and even amusing but when all is said and done both men made decisions NOT based on their supposed special relationship but on the needs of the day.  Roosevelt was at first suspicious of Churchill, then came to be a fan or his, but turned again suspicious of Churchill as he pursued the courting of Stalin.  I am not convinced that there really was a meaninful and consequential relationship between Roosevelt and Churchill.  Without this relationship much the same would have probably occurred.  Meacham does not demonstrate that his thesis is valid.    Having recently read Meacham's analysis of the Jesus Question in Newsweek I am not surprised that his work here is superficial and jejune -- the work of a journalist not a scholar.  He is a bright young man but doesn't have anything to say which would last more than a week 
 Not very useful if you want to study for maths level 1/2.only useful for part time end moment practice but not worth its money 
 In February 2007 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change concluded that, "most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities."  This conclusion was endorsed by the national scientific academies of the U.S, U.K., Canada, Russian, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, Brazil, China, and India, along with numerous other scientific societies around the world.  Christopher Horner disagrees, as do a few scientists and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists.  So if you want to believe that there's no anthropogenic global warming, you're stuck with having to explain why the experts got it wrong, and there are two ways to do this.  The hard way is to get some scientists together, do some experiments, and come up with a theory that explains the data better than the existing theory.  Submit your theory to peer review, and argue your case with more data and theory.  The easy way is to get some lawyers and come up with a conspiracy theory.  Conspiracy theories are fun because they require little effort and they always give you the answer you want.  And they're indestructible!  Evidence against the conspiracy theory is proof of the conspiracy.  Lack of evidence for the conspiracy is proof that it's a good conspiracy.  Oliver Stone made a movie about a conspiracy theory, and it was nominated for 8 Academy Awards.  Christopher Horner's conspiracy theory is about 1000 times more complicated than Oliver Stone's.  It requires scientists from all over the world, including people of all sorts of religious, ethnic, and political persuasions to be embroiled.  It requires oodles of falsified data to be published in the most prestigious journals and willfully misinterpreted by compliant funding agencies.  As usual, the media and the UN are in on it too.  Oh, and Horner suggests that the motive for the conspiracy is communism.  Communism!  The Cubans and the mafia must be feeling left out.  Is there any proof that the world's scientific community is in the grips of a communist conspiracy?  Of course not -- that's how we know the conspiracy is working.  The publishers of the Politically Incorrect Guides are really on to something.  If something bothers you, they will sell you a conspiracy theory to make you feel better about it.  Given that conspiracy theories require almost no research, the profit margin has got to be huge.  Heck they published a guide to the science of Intelligent Design more than a year after the guys who invented Intelligent Design admitted that there was no science behind it.  The plot of this one had the world's biologists, geologists, and paleontologists in an atheist conspiracy.  The weird thing is that there is no end of shady dealings in the real world that one could worry about.  Why make up a bunch of wacky conspiracy theories?  I guess it's fun to pick on egghead scientists, but I think you should consider the possibility that your outrage might be more effectively directed elsewhere 
 What I liked about this book is that it makes use of documents and materials from both the West and the Communist World.  It is an interesting mix and a fair look at both sides of the Cold War.  But there is the  problem as well.  Too much of the book and the evidence from both the US  and USSR at times contradict each other, while at other times supports each  other.  In short, the chapters are confusing.  Who is right?  Who is wrong?   For example their Cuban Missile Crisis chapters where interesting, but  heck if I can draw a conclusion as to what really happened.  Also, the  title.  The title is wrong.  It is clear that the US and the West one the  cold war.  I think that is an undisputed fact.  So again, the book has good  information, but it is at times too much.  The book is ultimately too much  info and not enough conclusions 
 I purchased this software because not only was it recommended by my school but because a fellow nutrition student recommended it.  It has wonderful features for charting and graphing nutrient intakes, but its database is sorely lacking.  I would expect that they would have included at least what is readily available in the USDA Nutrient Database, but the software doesn't even come close.  For those who eat mostly whole foods, the software is practically useless, especially since it only allows the user to add up to thirty of his or her own entries into the database.  All the charts and graphs in the world won't help if they don't accurately reflect what I've eaten!  One would be better off using the free, online software at the USDA's website: http://209.48.219.53/ 
 My husband and I bought two of these to take on a cruise for our snorkling outting. Due to weather, the snorkeling was canceled, but we did end up using the cameras.  One we used for regular pictures, outdoor only, beacuse there's no flash, and it was okay, though the pictures were a bit grainy. The other I took on a camping trip with some high school kids and the camera jammed a few pictures into the roll, I could turn and turn the winder, and the film wouldn't advance, but it would let me take another picture. After fighting with it the entire weekend, I ended up getting about 10 pictures that could be made out, though these were grainy, too 
 This book is the worst.  The suggestions of things to do are just plain aweful.  It seems to suggest every crowded fair and typical tourist attraction in any city.  This would be great if you love crowds and mayhem.  The suggestions are useless.  New Years Eve in Times square?  Mardi Gras?  Acadamy Awards?  Carnaval?  Who's not aware of these events?  It could have some redeaming qualities if it had suggestions about where to stay and how to plan these types of trips, but it does not offer any other information than the dates and location.  Nobel Prize Ceremonies?  Running of the Bulls?  Come on!!!! What a waste of paper, money and time.  
 Other reviewers have given the story outlines so I won't waste time repeating them.    Suffice it to say, thank goodness I borrowed this from the library rather than spending actual money on it.  I have enjoyed Davidson's "Betsy" books over the years but these stories come no where near the level of those books.  Perhaps if each of the stories were longer and more developed - and eliminated a lot of the gratuitous sex - I might have enjoyed them better. As it is, I was not disappointed when I finished the book, only surprised that I had actually finished it 
 It depends on what you want out of a book. Insubstantial hip?  Shallow characters that never learn a thing about themselves from beginning to end? Name dropping and cool toys? 
 How can you write a children's book on Great Moments in Baseball History and not include 1956 World Series Perfect Game! Don Larsen's World Series accomplishment was only recently matched by another former Yankee, David Wells!! What a terrific oversight 
 After I broke up with my boyfriend (whom I lived with for almost 2 years,) I was devastated. I read this book, among many others, hoping to find some comfort or insight into the process of breaking up and grieving (with also a little humor!)   Instead, this book insulted me with its immaturity. In the first chapter, the author writes under the headline "Sassy Battle Plan" to "secure embarassing photos of him to use in the future."  I mean, if you only saw a guy once or twice and are just feeling a bit annoyed or if you still find high-schoolish "schemes" funny, than maybe this is the book for you.   But if you are looking for any kind of useful advice about grieving and moving on, this is not the book to buy. I would recommend "The Girl's Guide to Surviving a Breakup" instead... 
 First of all, the writing style. Larson's writing style is easy to follow, but the book itself is badly edited, with lots of padding. For example, we learn on P.69 about the 25 day DMA and two pages later the 200 DMA is presented. I had hoped for a better discussion of TC2000's proprietary indicators, MS, TSV and BOP, but the book presents a rehash of the documentation supplied with the software.  More important is the book's target audience. Don't even bother buying this book uless you intend to use Worden's TC2000 charting software. All discussions, indicators and charts are explained using this software as reference. On the other hand, if you have this software, you presumably already have a good understanding of the standard and proprietary indicators supplied with the package, and don't need lengthy tutorials on moving averages and relative strength. In this respect, the book's audience is unclear.  For me, what the book missed was material for the advanced TC2000 user, such as using the software's scanning and programming language capabilities. I assume that Larson himself is an advanced TC2000 user, it would have been nice if he had included some trading strategies making use of the software's advanced capabilities. Sadly, all this is missing 
 As a vegan for almost 10 years, and someone who loves to cook, I am constantly searching for new cookbooks.  While the recipes in this book were easy to follow, the few that I tried did not taste very good.  I tried four of the recipes, being faithful to the instructions.  The recipes seemed to rely on an overdose of spices.  I was not impressed.  Simple, yes.  Tasty, no 
 As usual, the atrophied intellect that is Allan Bloom successfully attempts to rape a classic piece of philosophy with his mediocre, lackluster, ogrish brutality, which is his norm, towards true academia, knowledge and wisdom. If Rush Limbaugh re-wrote the Constitution you'd get an idea of the ruse that masks itself analogous to Mr. Bloom's feebility towards writing and thought contained within this boorish tome.  If you just want to read the Republic as it was intended, to the best of our Anglo-Franco-Germanic understanding of the last two centuries, steer far clear of Mr. Bloom's literary abortion within these pages.   If you further care of preserving your ability to reason, unfiltered and unprejudicially, I suggest looking into Mr. Bloom's history and agenda towards the upheaval of education, truth and attitude(s) toward integrity and intellectually honest liberty before considering wasting your hard earned currency on his insidiously dishonest dribble 
 David Irving, for those who read his books and read the Trial Transcripts, makes it quite clear that   1. The Jews were killed by the Nazis  2. Hitler as Head of State is ultimately responsible.  3. How this happened is not as clear cut as made out to be and at any time things could have turned out differently and that everyone shares responsibility for these atrocities and no one came out of this war with clean hands.  This is why he is hated. 
 I've read a couple other books by Bill's books and always loved them.  Great characters, great story line, involved and wonderful.  This book was missing all of that - and then some.  The main characters are SO uninteresting that I had a hard time continuing to read.  I could have cared less if the old billionaire lived or died.  Does the married eco-freak couple actually keep the baby ... WHO CARES.    The story revolves around organ transplants, the drive of an old wealthy man to procreate and cure himself, a couple fighting for the rights of the environment, a third world organ thief of a doctor, and a crazy orphan who sells himself for a living.  Yes it has promise.  No - the story line does not deliver.  Please don't buy this book.  You'll only be disappointed 
 Be sure when you order this book you are getting the version you wish to purchase. The full size paperback is a gem. The minature edition is a waste of money. Be aware that the postage on the minature edition costs more than buying a second volume of the book on line used 
 On the cover and in the book, Amy Flowers presents herself as an "insider". In fact she only worked as a phone sex operator for a brief period of time as part of her research, and it sounds like she walked away from the experience thoroughly repelled.   In every paragraph she is passing judgments on her respondents for creating the fantasy the customers pay them to create. Where her respondents do not agree with her foregone conclusions, she pronounces them self-delusional. One of the companies mentioned practiced bait-and-switch and other scams with the customers - she blames the operators, and rather than investigating how prevalent it is for companies in the industry, declares it to be universal.   Perhaps she got a grade for this because her advisors also had the same closed-minded view of the industry. She certainly whines about her research not being taken seriously because it was an adult industry she was investigating.   This could have been an important work, but someone else would have had to do it. Ms. Flowers only found what she was looking for.   If you want to learn something about the people who work in phone sex, start with Phone Sex: Aural Thrill and Oral Skills by Miranda Austin or Dirty Talk: Diary of a Phone-Sex "Mistress" by Gary Anthony.   If you want to learn how not to conduct sociological research, read this book. 
 This is the second Vault guide that I have read, and the second disappointment that I have had with this series.  I really isn't a career guide at all, just a very short back ground on what IB is.  You can find a description of IB on the internet for free.  The only redeeming value is the "day in a life of", but even then, there are only a dozen pages or so.  In all, you can find most of what is in the book for free on the internet.  I won't be buying any more vault products, as they have little information, and more pages of ads for other vault products than pages of usefull information 
 Say what you will about Disturbed's mean quality - they succesfully dug out a niche for themselves in the hard rock community with their debut based on confrontational shock-value lyrics, a catchy hook-based songwriting style, and an easily recognizable rhythmic edge.  That's all still evident on Believe. It's just that that's all it is: more of the same. Only this time it lacks the memorable choruses and anthemic (if somewhat cheesey) lyrics of The Sickness. The petulant middle school aggression is even toned down, and without it the bluff falls apart. Disturbed at its core is really just another industry standard radio rock band. Draiman's psuedo-intellectual posturing appears to have been a manufactured image in what I fear was probably literally a manufactured band.  Nothing on this album could be fairly called a highlight. Occasionally a riff will catch my ear as being relatively interesting, but most of it runs together in the same formless metal-lite stew. It's the sort of music you pump at a party and ignore. A pretty yawn-inspiring album even by Disturbed's standards 
 The book was a disappointment.As a parent I was looking for a book to show my 10 year old not to judge his autistic brother on what other people think or what he can do.The very high funtioning austistic child in the book   receives his brothers approval only after the 5 year old reads a poem for  the school and wins his brothers friends acceptance. I was able to read the  book to my 5 year old twins changing the story 
 Boy do I feel like a sucker, this is likely the most useless, "living the art life" type of book I have ever read. Mr. Dorrell uses this book mainly as a platform for his ego-rich, self serving anecdotes and know it all type of advise and opinions. Have you ever been to a party with one guy who just "knows" everything and can not wait for an opportunity to tell you his opinion on anything ... that is how this book reads. It was irritating to say the least. If you have any art degree or have been to art school or have ever done anything art related at all, you already know whatever practical advice you can squeeze out of this book.   If you want good inspirational books on "living the artist life" pick up Art & Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland (amazing book), The Shape of Content by Ben Shahn or The Art Spirit by Robert Henri. If you want to run an art business, it sounds cheesy but pick up How to Start a Home Based Crafts Business by Kenn Oberrecht, very practical and no-nonsense - not just for crafts. 
 I found this DVD to be extremely disappointing, especially when compared to the 2002 FIFA World Cup Highilights DVD by Reedswain (and I don't think Reedswain has produced one for the 2006 WC).  If you want to see a bunch of goals, one right after the other, then perhaps you'll enjoy it.  However, I think this DVD utterly and completely fails to capture the excitement, anticipation, electric atmosphere, and beauty of the tournament.  To me, it was a passion-less production.  There is little to no pre-match analysis/introduction of the games being played, or its star players; there is no break in between the goals from one game to the next; and there are no highlights other than goals. I know, that's why it's called "All the Goals", but without other meaningful highlights, the goals are seen out of context and are almost meaningless.  For instance, how can you not show Zidane's infamous headbutt on Materazzi in the final, and how it affected the game?  This DVD doesn't.  And what about the drama of Australia scoring 3 goals in the remaining 10 minutes against Japan, after Japan had been leading 1-0 the entire game?  This DVD captures none of that drama.  If you just want to see all the goals of WC 2006, you can do it for free at the FIFA WC website.  They even show some great highlights as well, but there's no commentary.  And no, I am not affiliated with FIFA in any way, shape, or form.  
 The advice he gives is totally absurd!  If a guy came to where I was working and greeted me with "Hey Good Lookin!" and handed me a cheap teddy bear, I'd think he was a sexual predator!    Maybe this stuff works in some places, but in the Midwest, you'd really creep people out.  I mean..."hey Good Lookin'"?  Ewww 
 I like Non-Fiction military books and I was looking for battle accounts of the Korean War. This book seems pretty promising with over 100 customer reviews; After reading one review saying the book was a work of fiction, I went to the Library to check for my self before ordering the book.    This is what I found in one of the front pages: "This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places, and incidents are either the product of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously, and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, business establishments, events, or locales is entirely coincidental."  Plus I have found the same copy of the book on diferent book stores, some saying "This is a work of fiction" and other don't seem to display it, so My guess is that is a work of fiction.  Just wanted to share it, so if you are looking for a non-fiction book this is not for you. 
 I based my purchase of this book on the review here on these web pages by psychologist Craig Chalquist, based on his comment (in effect) that life well-lived necessarily has highs and lows in it, one must accept, even embrace both dark and light phases, as a tree needs both sunlight and dark night to fulfill its potential.  It was with that understanding well in hand I began reading St. John of the Cross.  Other reviewers have said it's difficult to read, perhaps because of the tranlator's stated goal of being as true to the 16th-century Spanish as possible, not rewriting it to make it more accessible and losing the literary voice of the original which, apparently, is the more important value of this work.  I don't have a problem with the language, and it's not a big book, just over 200 pages, but I haven't quite finished reading it and I'm not sure if I will (oh, I probably will) because something about it makes my skin crawl. I reject this sort of ascetic mysticism on grounds that it's philosophically flawed--it's the tortuously convoluted path of a labyrinth from which one exits by the same gate as one entered, and for what?  To me it suggests nothing more than pathological, compulsive, sado-masochistic auto-eroticism.  Union with God, indeed; get your hand out of your pants, go outside:  God is everywhere.  Turn off the computer, get some exercise; let God find you.  I shall serve no god who demands obedience from slaves; my god loves me for my willful independence.  If we are made in God's image, does that mean God is a self-flagellating crybaby?  Get up!  Get on your feet!  Be Lightning!  Be Thunder!  Be Earthquake and Avalanche!  Be Iceberg and Volcano, Tidalwave and Twister! Make God proud!  Don't buy this book! 
 I was disappointed to see that this was an old book dating back to the 1990's, with a new foreword. P 
 I totally love the song, God Rest Ye Merry Gentleman/We Three Kings and Carol of the Bells, the remainder of the CD isn't that great.  I thought for sure I'd love almost every song, but unfortunately I only listen to the two songs mentioned above.  
 If you're made to buy this book you have every right to hate the professor that makes you do so. This book is a punishment! Not only is it very expensive, but it also offers information that it is not relevant to the real world at all.  There are some positive sides in this book after all. There are quick references on almost every page to make it easier to follow the chapter; there are good graphs the explanations to the graphs as well as the general argument do fit (more or less). There are also case studies, a fairly solid web page, and self-assessment questions that are helpful to get through with this material.  However, the style is unnecessarily pompous, filled with theories that make no or only very little sense; the information presented is way to shallow to really understand what the authors are getting at, yet miraculously they manage to fill the book with more than 500 pages with endless waffle. In some places, the author's even contradict themselves, which is the most impressive thing about this book.  Generally only two stars are awarded for this book, as it really is a waste of money and time, however if you have to read this insult for any intellectual mind, you will find some help to make nonsense into a science. Good luck to you! 
 I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent.  This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading.  The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful.  I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed.  I ask you  how many women do you know that use a term like "skirt hound" for a man who chases women?  I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me!  It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue.  Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one 
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 John Mayer can grow his hair long and play his guitar slung low, but he is still a professionaly trained monkey, I mean musician. Mayer along with "artists" like Gavin DeGraw, Teddy Geiger, etc., are todays N'Sync and Backstreet Boys, nothing more.  
 George Lakoff's advice and efforts to help John Kerry in the election really worked out well. It's obvious Lakoff is dispensing the same wonderful advice to the DNC Chair Howard Dean. As an Independent conservative I am thrilled with George Lakoff's work. Thanks, Georgie 
 Parenting means to prepare a child for life, to nurture, to love, to guide, to teach. Discipline is loving guidance, not corporal punishment, where the child in a demeaning and destructive way wrongly learns that violence is a form of acceptable communication and guidance, by parents. There are no benefits to hit a child - It is destructive for a child's self worth, self esteem, and demeaning and disrespectful. Children have feelings and emotions as adults. It is extremely unfair and disgraceful of parents to misuse their power on weaker people - our children - who are defenseless and who don't have their own voice. Your child will be confused and think "Why is my mother and father whom I love and trust inflicting pain on me?" Hitting a child, will separate the bond between parents and a child, and will only make the child fearful of their parents. In addition, hitting a child won't teach and guide a child towards better behavior in a constructive and communicative way. By slapping someone, what do you learn? Nothing - only that it is okay to be antisocial and misbehave and to be violent. Parents who hit their children are THE ONE'S misbehaving. They are no good role models. These parents need parenting classes and therapy as they are victims of abuse themselves. These parents are out of control and out of knowledge.   Think of the Golden rule: Treat other people, yes children are people too, as you with to be treated yourself, with respect, love and kindness. Children are children: They need a safe place to explore their boundaries and to test their parents' love, where parents act as wise, patient, and loving parents- as parents. Why spank a child whose brains are not yet fully developed? Children don't know right from wrong -  It is our job to guide and teach them, not punish them. Christians should know better that "spare the rod, spoil the child" from Proverbs in Old Testament is not current any longer. Remember- With Jesus comes a better way, a New Law: The New Testament. Jesus does not spank the children. Jesus says "Let the children come to me". Jesus loves the little children. My fundamental questions are: Why do these parents give birth to children in the world if they can't raise children and love children? Where is the human intelligence here? These dysfunctional parents have grave limitations when it comes to parenting children, as they have not healed from their wounded past and subconsciousness. Their only driving force is to let the child take away their own pain from abuse, by forcing them to pay the price for their own pain, and force the child know how it feels like to be abused.

 What a strange little book. That was the first thought that crossed my head after I closed "Into the Green". It concerns the adventures of Angharad, a tinker-woman who is also `Summerborn', which means that she has a mystical gift that connects her with the realm of Faerie, better known in this world as `the Green'. Travelling the three islands that make up her Celtic-flavoured world, Angharad's mission in life is to awaken other potential Summerborns to their dormant gift and prevent the magic of the Green from leaking out of the world through her singing, storytelling and harping.   In the first surprise of the book, the heroine does not marry at the finale of the story but at its beginning - and just as abruptly her husband Garrow is taken from her by the plague. With her husband, family and community dead she is forced into a new calling as a solitary wanderer. For the first few chapters of the book, it seemed that De Lint was mapping a rather unusual plot: each chapter is a self-enclosed adventure of Angharad as she searches for fellow Summerborns, a format you would expect from a episodic television series. For example, in one chapter Angharad meets a tree wizard and helps out his misguided apprentice, in another she finds herself in a dangerous situation with some witch-hunters, one of whom is a Summerborn himself. Each crisis is wrapped up by the end of the chapter, and has no further bearing on the rest of the story.  But just as I began to settle in and enjoy this unique volume of mini-adventures (told in beautiful prose with a wonderful melding of Celtic myth and original ideas), De Lint throws in an actual story, with cross-chapter references and character building. Unfortunately this story wasn't quite as interesting as it should have been, and I had already found De Lint's previous path (of telling one story of Angharad's life per chapter) quite appealing. Now we're dealing with a mysterious puzzle-box is uncovered after thousands of years, one that poses a threat to the Summerborn and the Green. Angharad is charged with the task of finding and destroying it.   From here, about a dozen new characters are introduced (none of whom are as interesting as those found in the first half of the book) who are rather difficult to keep track of. The quality of the puzzle-box story can be summed up in the fact that I remember Angharad's solo adventures at the beginning of the book very well, but have no idea as to how she managed to eventually destroy the power of the puzzle box.   As I said, it's an odd little book. Many will share my sentiment that the idea of a series of short-stories concerning Angharad's life was a unique and interesting conceit; others will be impatient for the longer story-arc of the book that involves the sinister puzzle box. I certainly don't regret reading "Into the Green" as it has some neat little ideas concerning the life and qualities of the tinker-folk, and De Lint's language is beautiful, but still...it's odd 
 I love my Microfiber Bath Towel, so I thought that the hair turban would be a perfect compliment to it! I do like how it wraps up my long, thick hair (with room to spare), but I don't think it absorbs the moisture in my hair any more than a fluffy regular towel. Actually, it gets extremely soaked after just a few minutes in the towel. I wouldn't purchase this product again. Instead, I would buy another bath towel and use a hair clip to keep it up 
 I was very excited to give this DVD a try after reading such good reviews.  I thought it would be similar to the weight training class I take at my local gym.  Unfortunately it did not live up to the reviews or my expectations.  This is a great workout for beginners but not for people who have been at this for a while.  It seemed like I was resting for at least 5 of the 15 minutes for each segment.  I never once felt my muscles getting fatigued from the workout.  After only trying it once I will be putting it up for sale and continue on with my pursuit of finding a challenging workout DVD focusing on weight training. 
 I don't know about the other songs but they have no right to make a Marilyn Manson song sound so bad, how dare they!!!! I am out raged! I love his version, wait, I love him too!! He he he!! He is gorgeous and very very sexy!! Now where was I? Oh yes, this album sucks big time, don't buy it other wise I will come after you and eat you, only kidding!!! Ha Ha Ha. Now you are probably going to buy it just to see if I will come after you because you think I am insane. Well I am telling you it is a mistake! It's your choice. Bye for now 
 Incredibly frustrating.  I was quite happy with my T30 until I recently upgraded my windows media player to version 11.  It became IMPOSSIBLE to add any new music.  There is a firmware upgrade on the iriver website, which I downloaded and installed three times.  It just doesn't work!  I managed to solve this problem only by rolling back to WMP 10.   BTW, I emailed iriver customer support about this problem and waited 17 days for a response 
 After using over 10 Lonely Planet books to travel Asia and Latin America, I thought I'd give this book a shot since many people had praised it. I was very disappointed. The maps, the background information, and the writing are just BLAND, BLAND, BLAND. Lonely Planet is still king if you want interesting, informative information with highly detailed maps. Concerning Inda, it's best to buy either LP's Northern India or Southern India in separate editions- one book just can't do justice to a country as large and diverse as India 
 Good product, forget about service. I e-mailed InFocus about my faulty projector 8th January 2005 it is now 7th January 2006 and I still do not have my projector. That's right, it's been ONE YEAR since my projector stopped working, I have given up on it being repaired (it was under warranty) and am now struggling to get it back so that I can repair it out of my own pocket. Check this company's record at  the Better Business Bureau, it is deemed to be unsatisfactory due to unanswered complaints 
 I opened this book without having read a single review, armed solely with the knowledge that it had won the National Book Award.  I wish I had been armed with a paper shredder.  For such a rich and potentially captivating topic, Tuck did a horrendous job.  The life of the beautiful Ella Lynch, mistress South America's most enigmatic and charismatic tyrant, should have provided us with cutural and personal insights beyond a standard history text book.  For example, I would have liked to have finished this book with an understanding of how Francisco Solano Lopez managed to inspire 60% to 80% (depending on your source) of his country's inhabitants to die in a war which had absolutely no rationale.  Instead, I got a good solid dose of the Latin Lover.  Tuck did her research, but not to a greater degree than any high school student.  At no point in the story did I gain an understanding of the causes of the war, or of the unique political and social position held by Paraguay in South America at that time.  Not only did Tuck miss the broader context--the political rivalry between Argentina and Brazil, the constant power vacillations of post-independence South America, the struggle to establish national identities--she completely failed to establish the character of Paraguay and Paraguayans.  This is as unforgivable in a historical novel as failing to develop the characters (a feat which Tuck also manages to accomplish!).  Not only did Tuck do a slap dab job with South American history, her writing was consistently poor.  Long botanical lists which had no relevance to the plot (what little there was), letters, diary entries, which were all meant to provide the reader with verisimilitude, merely slowed down the prose.  Short,almost cartoonish, sexual encounters between undeveloped characters, one-paragraph vignettes, strange graphic violence, all gave a disjointed quality to the prose which made it tempting to skip paragraphs, if not whole pages.  Last, but not least, the author clearly does not speak Spanish.  This wouldn't have been a problem had she employed the services of a native speaker to check her error-ridden manuscript. (And where, pray tell, was her editor?)It was highly irritating to wade through grammar mistakes that a first-year Spanish student could have caught and corrected.  All in all, a highly disappointing read 
 This pan fails to deliver. This pan is the black sheep of the All Clad line. It is made of solid stainless steel and is not an aluminum triply pan as it is advertised. It is also made in Korea unlike the other All Clad products which are made in the USA. Shop around there are better products out there for half the price 
 This book has no original ideas, says nothing positive about any subject, has no theme except "I am so smart and all others in the world are so stupid."  I kept looking for another message, or some indication about what might take us in a better direction but could find nothing.  It was discouraging to be required to select between one and five stars.... as without that requirement my rating would be "Less than Zero! 
 Clancy has gotten the best-selling writer thing down to a formula: a taut, suspenseful plot populated by militaristic all-American heroes and the evil-doers de jour. His merit lies in coming up with gripping, if improbable, settings for his stock characters. On the other hand, his actual writing is mediocre, unimaginative, and devoid of art.  Rainbow Six is the conservative Clancy's broadside against the environmental movement. The book's basic (and typically unbelievable) premise is that, in order to save the planet, fanatical environmentalists in charge of a major corporation devise a plot to kill off nearly all of mankind, while the brave men of the elite multinational force to which the title refers strive to thwart them. The unbelievable part: environmentalists in charge of a major corporation! Everybody knows that all the big corporations are in the capable hands of patriotic, polluting, profiteering Republicans 
 Mr. Das (aka Jeff) seems to enjoy dragging the reader through as much suffering as he can recall. That appears to be his main point. The text is scattered with no logical order.  Frank Hazelwood 
 I actively dislike this dishrack. As noted, plates and bowls slide out because of open sides, it's too small for anything but VERY casual use (don't buy it if you do all your dishes by hand), and contrary to the PR, it does indeed rust. Water catches in the bottom and has nowhere to drain, so you end up with an unsanitary pool of water under your dishes. Not recommended 
 I washed the cover for the first time and it didn't hold up.  The ends are frayed and there are even holes where the elastic band  attaches to the terry.  Also little pieces of the terry got all over everything else I washed with it.  I'm extremely disappointed with this product 
 Don't get me wrong -- I'm a big fan of ethno-techno & worldbeat chillout music, but this Buddha Bar disc manages to take an otherwise exciting, vibrant genre of music and render it completely mundane and uninvolving.  All the tunes are just so bland;  they plod along in a very conventional, new-agey kind of way with the occasional tabla, flute or monastic chant thrown in to lend a vague exotic feel, but you just sit there wondering when the real musical journey is going to start.  It never does.  For those looking to explore the wide range of excellent ethno-electronica out there, Buddha Bar is not your starting point.  Instead, check out some of the big names of the genre:  Loop Guru, Shpongle, Banco De Gaia, Bill Laswell and Makyo are all in a league far beyond this meagre compilation.  Don't waste your time on Buddha Bar 
 Overall a bad buy! Horrible DVD mastering with menus that never fully load and buttons that don't work. The movie has a couple of really funny extra clips in it, but nothing really "finished." The extended scenes aren't scored, which is really distracting because I couldn't stop thinking about the great "Mondo Bongo" song that should have been there during the alternate ending, et al!  Don't bother with this one... check out the Directors Cuts of "Kingdom of Heaven" (amazing!) and "King Arthur" - they're both very worthwhile 
 I use these alot, and got this to replace a GE timer that had fried.  Total junk.  The "manual override" function is just "Turn the dial until light is on or off as desired."  You must be freaking kidding me.  I got the 15 AMP rated timer, and it's only 2 prong...  WTF?  You don't run 15 AMPS without ground.  Dumb.  As other reviewers noted, it's loud, it often doesn't even work properly.  Save your money and just look for someone who has already bought one.  Chances are they've already determined it stinks and have it sitting in a drawer somewhere unused.  They'll give it to you happily 
 This book was not up to my expectations. Maybe I understood this introduction wrong- I hoped to find some hints to find great employees and some new ideas. Instead I read many times, that it is important to hire great employees and that they are not easy to find. To my opininon it is more like a childrens book, than for the adults. I am not a manager, but I read nothing new, instead I understood, that we are doing things ok already in our company. In real world things are not so easy and simple as in this book. At least not in Estonia, people are bit smarter. Some of the titles in this book were  longer that the chapters itself, I was lucky to get one good sentence per chapter 
 this is marys suns review. it broke in 2 days, first the full auto went then the shooting in general. dont get i 
 One hopes that the French edition, which is 400 hundred, not 100, pages longer, is considerably better, but I find that hard to believe. The writing is unacceptably choppy and awkward, with paragraphs springing from nowhere and sentences shifting from one grand topic to another without stopping. It's almost laughable. Chock full of details and totally lacking in style or spirit, this book will only be useful to those seeking a blow by blow chronology of Camus' life - and the chronology is uneven at best (many times Todd goes back several months without clear indication).  Poor writing wouldn't be a problem if there was at least a point of view, but Todd offers us none, preferring instead to recounting facts and quoting at length from Camus' letters. The fact that Camus was such a crystalline writer only makes this book seem like more of an insult.  I was hugely disappointed by this book. (... 
 David Fromkin's "Peace to End All Peace" is simultaneously a comprehensive and very flawed work. Many of the reasons for it being one can be found in the other.  Fromkin attempts to examine how the modern Middle East (extending as far as Afghanistan and some sections of Central Asia) was created during and after the First World War. Obviously, in order to do this, the fall of the Ottoman Empire in that war must be considered. This is where Fromkin's unusual methodology comes into play. Focusing on the European political machinations to resolve the "Eastern Question" in their favour, the sorry tale becomes one more of Churchill and TE Lawrence than of the Arabs and Turks who were also involved in the process. Admittedly, it was the Europeans who wielded the whip hand in deciding just where the borders were to be drawn, but reducing key figures such as the CUP Triumvirate in the dying Ottoman Empire (and Kemal Ataturk in Turkey immediately thereafter) to the status of supporting players ultimately skews the focus of the book too much.  Never let it be said that this is a simple story to retell. A complex web of national and personal political interests in both Europe and the Middle East combined to make the region what it is today, and any study of all of these will be faced with the need for convoluted explanations. The problem that Fromkin has, however, is that he does not make these very well at all. The story is told in a roughly chronological manner, which means that we jump from place to place and meet a bewildering array of characters. Ultimately, the only real result is confusion on the part of the reader, who is constantly flipping backwards to see who the latest figure to make an appearance actually is.  Additionally, Fromkin frequently confuses his readers with references to geographical features which are not well-shown on the maps provided. Indeed, one map (showing Enver Pasha's advance on Baku and his campaigns in Central Asia) is laughable in the extreme. The legend explains that the direction of the arrows is the direction of the various advances - which would be significantly more useful were the arrows in fact arrows, and not equilateral triagles.  Where Fromkin does well, however, is in his use of purely European sources. It is perhaps unusual to say this of a book intending to tell the story of the modern Middle East, but I have considerable doubts about the depth of his research into the Middle Eastern aspects of the events in question. In terms of Europe, however, his research seems to cover the major bases of exactly what the key figures believed and did.  Ultimately, "A Peace to End All Peace" is a difficult and not particularly rewarding work. A diplomatic history of Europe during the Great War can be written much better than this, and a history of the development of the Middle East following that conflict already has been (the chapters in Margaret Attwood's "The Peacemakers" or William Cleveland's "Modern Middle East" both easily outshine this) 
 It appears that the Viatek product (Bark Stop Pro) is related to the Lentek design (PC16 ; ASIN: B0002Q89O6) - they are based on a common design by a Lentek engineer. I have used (tried) the Viatek Bark Stop Pro and it definitely DOES NOT work. My experience was the same as another reviewer of the Lentek PC16 who noted that the unit only works on the "Audible" setting - dogs will at least perk up their ears at the high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever is emitted on the "Ultrasonic" setting. Furthermore, it is often activated by extraneous noises like birds, banging doors, wind noise, etc.   This really poor functionality is due to either poor design or poor construction / quality. I've tried two different units and they both do NOT work.   The negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices were tuned to the noise environment and could filter out all except the actual barks. 
 I saw this movie over the weekend&thought it was corny&Predictable but it passed the time so no harm no foul.iy had a few laughs but that was about it 
 Much too stereotypical for my tastes and the storyline is not only unbelievable- it drags on and on. Sadly, from reading some of the reviews on Amazon, Mr. Hiassen's stereotypical, over the top books on the people of Florida are read by many as real and some reviewers state that they want to visit Florida after reading Mr. Hiaasen's books. This is sad- that  people actually believe that the state is chock full of characters like Twilly Spree, Clinton Skink Tyree and Palmer Stoat. Where does he get these names? During my 25 years in Florida, the people I met  had names like Robert, Jim, Mary, Chris, Michael, etc. By the way, for those of you who think I am just a Floridian with sour grapes- I have been a proud resident of the Northeast for over 20 years. I just dislike stereotyping of groups of people. It causes prejeudice, misunderstanding and in extreme cases- hatred. Read some Christopher Moore for your humor fix. He doesn't stereotype and although his stories are over the top in his own way, he makes them believable and fun 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 This is one of my all time favourite movies so I was thrilled when I received it as a Christmas gift. Imagine my disappointment when I discovered that this is a defective disc. It plays for a few minutes and jumps back to the start. This happened evrytime I tried to watch it. Other discs play without a problem on my DVD player so the fault lies definitely with this disc. I do not have the packaging or the packing slip which I did not keep as I did noy expect a product received from Amazon to be of this poor quality. I don't know how to return it to Amazon in the absence of the packing slip. Please help. Sincerely, Mandakini Tat 
 Not sure what happened, but I received my daughter's gift in the mail today. There were no penguins in the box, and but the packaging looked original with no tampering. Beware, if you're ordering from Imaginarium! What a disappointment this was for us 
 I bought this book on the recommedation of the Tom Peters' "50" books.  I've so tried to extract some value out of it, but Schrage goes on and on without seeming to get to the point.  This book seems to be a mismash of Shrage's notes collected over the years.  Yes, simulations change the way we work and interact, but how can we best use them to communicate ideas or speed delivery of new products?  I derived much more value from Tom Peters merely encouraging me to prototype than from "Serious Play" 
 If you know any information regarding the actual 1947 unsolved case, I'd be surprised if you like this book!  Nothing like taking a famous murder case and writing it into such a made up joke of a story!!  Did I mention that it was boring as well?  makes you wonder why the author couldn't come up with his own story line, rather than creating a fictional oddity around such a famous murder?  While reading, I kept thinking this has got to get better....don't waste your time, I can answer that for you, it doesn't.....to sum it up, the unsolved murder theme, the actual storyline, and the buck tooth character, equals one LOUSY READ 
 Most of the purses in this book were so foolish looking I wouldn't use them if someone gave them to me, much less waste my time to make them.  I was looking for bags to make and sell but I have found better ideas for free on the internet.  To this books credit, it does give good instruction on construction basics such as pockets and linings 
 First off, I'll admit that I didn't read the whole book.  Now I'll say my peace on it.  Hacker generalizes broadly about the behaviors and sentiments of both whites and blacks.  Though white himself, he seems to absolutely  despise whites across the board as either racist scum or well-meaning but  idiotic.  Then he says that Martin Luther King Jr. only came to prominence  as a leader of the civil rights movement because the whites in power chose  him.  It sounds to me as if Hacker thinks that the black population were  too ignorant to choose there own leader and allowed the whites to give them  their hand-picked MLK Jr.  The thought of that makes me ill.  Apparently,  in Hacker's world view, everyone except himself is either evil or stupid.   But it was very entertaining 
 The idea behind the book is great, but the book itself fails to meet  expectations. The description on Native American life seemed  superficial  and like it had no experience or research behind it.  The charachters were  good, but the whole book seemed like a rough draft.The story never went  into enough detail. It jumped from one event to another without ever  spending enough time on each event to interest me.My advice is to skip it 
 This story starts out pretty successfully. We are shown the life of the brothers in the abbey and their daily routines. This seems to set the tone for a dull plot. Then, the reader experiences the sickness of a brother of the abbey and the mood of the story changes from the placidity of the abbey life to the chaos of trying to help the brother. This livens the book up some, but not enough. Very few exciting events happen between that point until the death of Rhisiart. After Rhsisiart's death, we are thrown back into that state of low-action; only this time, with the added commotion of trying to figure out the murderer's identity. The ending wasn't a huge shocker. It was almost too predictable from the beginning. So, all in all, I would not recommend this book unless you wanted to be easily put to sleep 
 ... But that's not really saying much. At least the main characters are back in this installment of The Sword of Truth Series.  This one has Richard Rahl, his wife Kahlan, their bodyguard Cara and company still traveling through The Old World. Richard's magical powers are failing, his headaches are back and will probably kill him if he can't get to his grandfather Zedd in time to help him. But then a group of desperate people poison the Lord Rahl in an effort to force him to help them, so now it's a toss-up as to what will kill him first - the Army of the Imperial Order, his gift or the poison. Meanwhile, Emperor Jagang (he's the bad guy) is moving in on The Wizard's Keep and things are looking dire.   Okay, It's nice to see old friends again. Zedd and Adie are here, along with Nathan (one of my favourite characters) and Ann and even Chase and Rachel show up - lots of fun there, but since when did simple, straightforward Richard become such a pompous, didactic windbag? The last few books in the series have been growing increasingly preachy, but in the past it has been other characters doing the preaching with Richard as the voice of reason teaching by example. Now, all of a sudden, he's spouting long-winded sermons about the virtues of hate and vengeance - what's up with that? And then there's Betty, the goat. She was irritating in the last book, but she's just a pain in the rear now. Don't get me wrong, I like goats, but come on - lock her in a pen and keep her out of the way!   I enjoyed some of the story in this one - especially with Zedd and Nathan and Chase, but out of 725 pages, maybe 300 were story. The rest is crap. I loved the frist few books in this series and often re-read them, but after the last two (this one and Pillars of Creation before it), I don't know if I will bother reading the last three of the series 
 Don't waste your time or money with this DVD.  The best part of the DVD is probably the Trailers and most of those are Garbage also.  My DVD came loose in the package and scratched, too bad it didn't do any damage to ruin the Movie.  I couldn't wait until the Movie was over, I would have stopped it earlier, but wanted to see if any damage was done.  You'll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier.  The last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off.  Don't waste your money, spend it on the cheap $5-6 horror DVD's, because at least those can be somewhat entertaining 
 This is at best a choppy book, written by various people on their perceptions of Asian business.  I think it does little to explain how Asian businesses actually operate -- some it is PR, some of it hype and some just  regurgitation from mewspapers, etc.  These are some of the same types of  people so picked on by the IMF now for failing to inform them how business  actually functioned in Asia!  The most telling evidence - although written  just prior to the onslaught of the Asian crisis, none of the  "experts" foresaw it or its effects on competitive business  operations in Asia.  It is even less useful now.  Marginal at best 
 This is a skeleton of a Bible names dictionary. It does not give the pronunciations correctly, and absolutely no references at all to where each name can be found in the bible. When will someone come out with a truly useable Bible names dictionary? This is definitely NOT it 
 This is a horrible book written from a very nasty point of view. Basically, this is a systematic dismantling of everything sacred about Judaism - to the point where the author actually uses the sacred name of God in the book. Obviously, the author knew that his use of the name of God would deeply insult those devoutly Jewish, and just as obviously, the author did not care if he insults deeply held beliefs.  It's important to understand that this is coming from a man that feels that what is now Israel will soon no longer exist as the Jewish homeland - and he demonstrates absolutely no concern for that, either.  No concern for the basics of the Jewish religion, disdain for the Jewish homeland, and disdain for the future of the Jewish race. Anti-religion, Anti-Judaism, Anti-Israel. There's a word for that 
 A hospital...understaffed...going under...  Then they make a mistake and kill a patient.  Meanwhile, a new patient with a dangerous rash is brought into the hospital.  And from there they all catch it...blah,blah,blah.  Sounds like it should be a decent movie.  It does have some creepy parts.  Unfortunately, it loses focus on its themes while trying to make you figure out what the heck is going on....if this is a ghost story, medical misadventure, or telenovela.  It goes all over the place and never satisfies.    Technical issues are done poorly.  A good example is when one sort-of ghost appears.  They then hide her head in the mirror (ooh, so spookie for a [...] year old), but then there are her hands and arms in the mirror.  But all those criticisms are nothing compared to THE WORST ACTING EVER!!!  The dialogue is absurd and the actors' reactions are just painfully overdone.  The actors go from confused and sullen to emotionally anguished and screeching for no reason.  I can accept ghosts, boogeymen, flying knife throwing turkeys if I must, but Rns and MDs who FREAK OUT when a patient needs resucitation... who become emotionally unstable when a patient falls out of bed....  OH, DEAR GOD, DON'T GIVE THAT PATIENT AN ASPIRIN!!!!    What is then worse is their lesser reactions to an infection that makes E.Coli look like a paper cut.  "A doctor was mean to me"= manic crying and screeching.  "That guy just exploded"= consternation.  What??  STUPID STUPID STUPID.       STUPID.  A last resort if you've never seen it....the bottom of the 'J-horror' barrel.  If you have never seen the genre, try any other movie first 
 The "original" Glide was made by (or used) Gore Tex material. The photo for this product showed the logo for Gore Tex. The product shipped was the product now marketed by Crest; no mention of Gore Tex. The Crest product is vastly inferior to the "original" Gore Tex 
 Philosophers should enjoy this one.  The story is about coming to grips about who you are, expectations and perceptions.  This book can be insightful for some, but for me, a little dry.  Forster did not foster a logical basis for Rickie to fall in love - or a hopeless romantic one for that matter.  From there, the story lost steam 
 Just in time for Christmas is an overpriced book about how much  Doro loves Daddums. The book is a poorly edited collection of  anecdotes that aren't really funny or interesting. (Indeed, they  sound as if they've been transcribed from tapes.) Granted,  daughters have a right to write about Daddy, but this book  makes Ronald Reagan's kids' books look like giant works of art.  What is it about the children of Republicans that makes them  think they can write something of interest?  There are at least 20 very good books about George Sr....  get one of those instead 
 I have the same problem as the others. It only works upside down. It only works outside. It chugs about inside. It works great in the Disney store. When you get it home. It is a huge dissapointment 
 I heard a favorable review of this CD on my favorite CBS Sunday Morning TV show. After listening to the entire CD, I must say I have never listened to it again.  The music was dreary and drepressing, every song sounding the same.  Wish I didn't buy it. 
 this movie is plain bad. yes good gun fight but where's the kung fu. Theirs plenty of american made film that are way better in terms of action sequence. Man even the gun fight in Face off was much better then the killer or hard boiled. Maybe im not into old fashion gun fight like in these two movie, i would rather watch a movie like ballistic kiss, great gun fight, some kungfu and a little special effect. I don't care if the killer or hard boil was made 10 or 20 years ago. It's just didn't live up to my potential. This is the 21st century, i need some special effect. I don't understand why some of you people keep living in the past. trust me their are way better mivie then these two and were made in the 70 and 80. Take for example the God Father 1 and 2, much better movie then these two, go and recomend this movie for the customer not some lame movie like killer and hard boil. As for chow yun fat check out my review for Hidden dragon crouching tiger 
 I followed the directions to the letter and cured my new pan as instructed. It's a great idea, but it just doesn't work. The cornbread sticks to pan 
 I personally feel that the  the book is small, being rightly meant to be carried by residents in wards, but cramped with borrowed information which exceeds the capacity of the book. A lot of it feature in other standard texts and nothing is new.The algorithms too are borrowed. Information on antibiotic usage and common tropical disorders in detail are lacking. Unnecessary publicity is being given to the book and The Osler Medical Handbook by Cheng and Zaas is far superior to this in all aspects. Another important aspect is that students reading the book do not read standard texts and are clearly at a disadvantage while appearing in examinations.The book needs to be rewritten in another format to be successful.

 It does not often happen that a book is rendered useless by a single sentence. This is one of them. Apparently in an attempt to legitimize the hideous cruelty of the inhabitants of old Mexico the author makes the following statement:  Every people, it is now generally supposed, has its own right to conduct itself as its national customs provide.  This is so incredibly stupid that it makes the author a self-professed idiot and therefore irrelevant.  Fortunately it comes early in the book, so that no discerning reader need waste too much time on this garbage. 
 OK, the original is a classic and is what...90...100 minutes long? Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story.  The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.  The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie. Now Jackson is adding 38 munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with?!?  Peter Jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently.Remind me to skip his next 15 3 hour long epics 
 I was also misled, the picture they used is the book that i needed, however, it is not the book i received. I wasted my money on a cd-rom guide book that i dont need or wan 
 For those individuals who have not been previously exposed to the concept of Customer Experience Management as an alternative to Customer Relations Management, this book might be an amazing eye opener.  But that would be strictly because of the exposure to a new idea, as it's certainly not the convulted style of writing which can result in even the most intelligent people scratching their heads.  I purchased this book in order to get very down to earth methods to begin applying the concept to the company I work for.  What I found, instead, was a list a mile long of jargon that all began to run together and sound the same.  "Experiential platform", "brand experience", "experiental value promise", experiential positioning"... soon enough my mind was preoccupied with trying to remember which was which, rather than being able to absorb the essence of what the author was trying to say.  And the crazy thing is that each of those phrases I just mentioned are supposedly the very concrete, measureable phases behind his take on the CEM approach!  Getting tangled in the minutia of catch phrases did nothing to help me move forward into CEM.  I've come away from the book disappointed I didn't learn anything of real value, but even more disappointed that I spent the money on the book.  Don't bother 
 This CD has some good songs on it, but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes! It's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than I expected. They are mixed together, and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started! If you don't mind really short songs, buy this, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise 
 This one isn't worth your time. It's pumped full out of hot air and is totally dated besides 
 Hi, I have all the 3 famous book of Kevyn Aucoin (Making Faces, Faces Forward and this) and this one is the worst. Why is this the most expensive? I don`t understand 
 Great book, but Amazon have made a serious mistake in the description.  They say it is "Leather Bound".   It is most definitely NOT leather bound.  It is leatherette, which is not leather.  Leatherette is fake leather made from some kind of plastic.  Don't be fooled.  IT IS NOT LEATHER BOUND.  I bought one and was very disappointed.  I told Amazon, but they didn't want to know and I see they are still advertising it as leather when it is not 
 Although they claim that this item can be used by adults, it is the furthest thing from the truth.  You can only fill the black bottom HALF up with water, which you wouldn't know until you buy it.  Due to this, you can't do any combonations with this bag as you knock on its' side with even the most mild of punches. Also, after a few hits, it rips open like your fists were made of nails even with gloves on.    The only reason why this purchase was made was due to the fact that I have no where to hang my actual heavybag in my apartment. This is not even remotely a replacment for a real bag.  Save your twenty five dollars for something else 
 I have Doreen Virtue's other deck of Magical Mermaids and Dolphins.  I bought this one, thinking it was the same.  I was disappointed at the sameness of the cards, and the messages.  The cards are nicely drawn and do invite imagining.  However, it is a little heavy on white horses, and does not have enough variety 
 Why does this man enjoy a reputation as a medievalist? Why does he have tenure at a prestigious university? If I were to try to write a book about ancient history, I couldn't dumb it down enough to compete with this "professor's" endeavors. Read the first chapter and decide for yourself. I guess that Tom Wolfe is right about the current state of American college classrooms, if this Cantor is any indicator of what is being taught on campuses these days (I am Charlotte Simmons).   Then again, to the people who glean their inspiration from Dan Brown % co when it comes to history and learning, I suppose that Cantor seems a sage by comparison. If you haven't studied ancient societies one iota, this book will serve you well as an introduction. For anyobe else I would suggest about a dozen other books by way of introduction. Try your hand at Fernand Braudel's HISTORY OF CIVILAZATION, HG Wells' HISTORY OF THE WORLD, and of the Cambridge or Oxford World Hisories, etc. Just put this claptrap out of your mind and don't even bother perusing it, as I made the mistake in doing.   This is the second book from this "medievalist" I've reviewed. All I can say is that it must be a very easy task to get an A in a course he teaches at NYU. So if you you have a son or daughter taking courses there, make sure they sign up for one of his classes. No problem when it comes to outwitting the "professor." Sorry to be so mean, but when it comes to medieval and ancient history, I'm a nudge. I happen to be a big fan of both Herodotus and Gibbon. Professor Cantor is bush league in comparison. No excuses for shoddy scholarship in a field you are supposed to excell in.    BE 
 This book struck me because it appears to address a wide issue in depth.  Unfortunately, the introduction only gives a few brief details about the authors of the book, who include mainly interested writers, as far as I can tell.  As a former history major, I have often come across examples of exhaustive research; unfortunately, this book cannot fall under that criterion.  Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln are not trained scholars and their mildly critical perspective leads to some interesting logical jumps.  Unfortunately, the authors will posit a claim with only one source to support their argument.  This sort of specious scholarship allows the writer many freedoms in terms of the conclusions he can come to, because of the lack of acknowledgment of conflicting sources which would heap contrary evidence on his weak claims.  Overall, the book is neither terribly interesting nor well-researched.  This is like if the Da Vinci Code were a restaurant and Holy Blood, Holy Grail were the menu.  It seems appetizing but there isn't any substance or sauce to entertain the taste-buds.  
 Hoping for an exciting read with this, my first Lee Child mystery.  Unfortunately you don't always get what you hoped for.  Every aspect of this story is poorly thought out.   I'm as willing as the next person to suspend reality for the sake of an exciting storyline, but this is too implausible to be ignored.  Buy a John Sandford novel instead.  
 i hate to be negative, especially about a very talented artist, but this album just sounded like he copied "collaborations" and just switched a few of the words. like "47 pop stars" it was just lame compared to the acappela "47 m.c.'s" from "collaborations" which was brilliant. there are a few good tracks, but i was dissapointed by the lack of creativity. hopefully K.J. will not try to follow what seemed to be a successful formula when he records his next album. COME ON K.J., I'VE HEARD YOU DO BETTER THAN THIS 
 This is the story of a very arrogant doctor who quits his medical practice because of what his "Inner Teacher" told him. This could be a sign of psychosis. Nowhere in the books is the distinction between psychosis and psychic ever made. Perhaps Joy does not want his readers and potential students to know the difference 
 "A Facsimile of the original edition" ? My mother has an original copy (7th edition) which was handed down to her & it is now held together with tape & love. Borrowing that book from my mom made me a bit nervous so I wanted to get one for myself. I did a lot of reading of reviews & finally decided on this one. Yes it does have all recipes that the original had but without ANY cooking temperature (electric, gas or internal temps). Even the time tables on page 32 & 33 with cooking times didn't have the temperatures that they needed to be cooked at. My mother's does except the charts are in a different area of her book. I am sorry but I am not going to sit down with a brand new cook book & take my mother's book & write down what temperature every single recipe needs to be cooked at. There was one recipe that state "cook for 20 mins. at a very high temp" & my mothers book said " cook for 20 mins. at 450 F". It almost looks like the temperatures were purposely left out because everything else appeared to be the same. Copyrights problems?  I am returning this book because it didn't meet my expectations & felt it was misrepresented 
 Who ripped off who? Emma or Clueless?  The entire time I'm watching this movie I'm wondering when Alicia Silverstone is going to pop up.  I keep thinking "there's got to be something different coming up" but no... it was pretty much the same exact plotline.  I love Gwyneth - but I was not impressed with Emma 
 I found the book well-organized and quite lucid. The author clearly understands the program well. The book's Achilles heel (and probably the reason for its relatively inexpensive price) is that there are only a few color illustrations in the center. All of the other illustrations are done in low resolution B&W, making it nearly impossible to appreciate the techniques or changes in images. If the publisher had raised the price a few dollars and done the illustrations in color, the book would be vastly more valuable 
 If you've read Kroeger and Thusen's other books, like "Type Talk At Work" or "Type Talk", you'll recognize most of that material in this book.  "16 Ways To Lover Your Lover" doesn't add much to  the two works mentioned above, and if you are well read on the MBTI this  book won't add much to what you already know.  However, if Type is new to  you, and you're looking for some fun ways to explore your relationship with  a significant other, this book is worth a shot 
 I'm not even going to go into detail on this one, as I usually do with my reviews. This book is BAD. Random characters dying left and right in meaningless ways that contribute nothing to the story. As a previous reviewer said...It plays out like a bad video game, you know the ones that cost $4.99 at Kmart by some obscure gaming company nobody has ever heard of? Like that 
 They are decent headphones sound quality wise. I have very complaints in that department. However, even after a few minutes, they can become very painful to wear. I suppose you get what you pay for, but usually Philips is better than this. Needless to say, I plan on returning them.   Also, just a side note, the current picture featured in this product listing is not what the headphones look like. I'm not sure what model those headphones are, but the actual SHP2500 look nothing like that. Hopefully Amazon will fix that soon.  -Edit: Amazon has updated this product listing now. The picture now matches what the headphones actually look like 
 .....tries to explain hyper dimensions.  Like other disappointed reviwers, I should have paid heed to the negative reviews. I first saw the book on 'Charlie Rose', the subject sounded intriguing and that tipped the balance in the book's favor. I often try to keep abreast of scientific breakthroughs and regularly read popular science books.  When reading books, I value good skill in literary writing. Randall sorely lacks the panache to keep a reader glued to the book. Her literary style is dry and uninspired. The prose is awkwardly punctuated with lame attempts at humor.The humor feels more cursory and forced than natural and effortless. And I absolutely agree with some of the other reviwers about the vignettes, they are embarrasingly hackneyed. The pedestrian, pop culture imagery that the vignettes project clashes with the transcendental nature of the subject at hand. Like many others, I was seduced by the exotic nature of hyper dimensions. I still am. But as a theoretical physicist of such repute, one would expect Randall to be perceptive enough to know her limitations as a literary author. Explaining hyper dimensions must be a daunting task for anyone, more so when explaining it to the layman.Randall's mundane analogies when explaining dimensions and branes coupled with her lack of prosaic skills do not help matters. I personally think, no corporeal analogy can fittingly conceptualize an extra dimension. Hyper dimensions are by nature beyond human perception. Hyper dimensions were not a direct product of empirical thought process, but a consequence of mathematical equations. I am not even sure if theoretical physicsts can really visualize or perceive hyper dimensions without a mathematical crutch.  What Randall's purpose is in writing this book is not clear. She dedicates multiple pages in the book to people who helped her write this book, people she calls her friends, people who helped her edit the book and proof read it. If these people are her truly her friends, they should have stopped her from putting such an ill-conceived book out in the market. The 2 stars that I give this book are for effort. Randall did spend time and effort in putting this book together, as amtuerish as it is. There are many other books that tackle the same subect with aplomb. One important thing I learned from this experience, do not trust talk show hosts' literary recommendations!! 
 Recent players who are good get included, many great players from bygone eras get totally neglected 
 Dick Staub represents a new generation of so called Christians.  From the roots of the seeker movement and the Purpose-Driven movement comes forth the next "move" and that is a movement that claims to be Christian in name only but underneith are nothing more than liberals.  From Donald Miller's BLUE LIKE JAZZ to the writings of the emergent church movement, Staub falls in line with those who embrace Christianity some what but fail to tell us what they mean by Christian.  In other words, they claim to be Christians in name only and not in doctrine (1 Timothy 4:16).    TOO CHRISTIAN, TOO PAGAN is Staub's attempt to call the "church" to engage the culture by simply becoming part of the culture.  He attacks fundamentalist Christians who early in the 20th century were calling out Christians from the culture to create a sub culture of Christians living in a pagan society as they saw it.  I see Staub's point here and agree that Christians should indeed recongnize that we live in this world although we are not part of it (1 Peter 2:4-11).  We do need to engage the culture however I believe that we should engage the culture with the gospel (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:15-16; Acts 1:8).  I have no problem with Christians who want to do art or movies but to become one with our world is forbidden in Scripture (1 John 2:15-17).    Biblically speaking, how did the early Church engage their cultures?  Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 9:19-23 are often misused by writers such as Staub, Miller, or a host of other post modern "Christians" by their assertion that Paul became "one with the culture in order to impact the culture."  However a proper exegesis of 1 Corinthians 9:19-23 reveals the opposite.  Paul is not becoming one with the culture but he is speaking of the keeping of the Law (v.20) in order to see men saved (v.23).  So that we don't miss the point, Paul goes on in verses 24-27 to show that Paul was firmly committed to being a disciple and preaching the gospel.  His words in 1 Corinthians 10:1-22 should be a clear call to Staub that we are not be like the world.  The early Christians impacted their generation by being disciples of Jesus (John 13:34-35).  They understood that the way to impact a culture is not through politics, arts, or any creation of men but through the proclaimation of the Word of God (Acts 6:4; Romans 10:9-17).  It is the Word of God that brings conviction of sin (John 16:8; Romans 7:7) and it is the Word of God that we hear the truth of Jesus (John 14:6) and are saved (James 1:21).  Disciples making disciples is the key (Matthew 28:19-20).    Overall this is not a good book for true disciples.  If you really want to change your world then read THE MASTER PLAN OF EVANGELISM by Robert Coleman or THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS by John MacArthur 
 This book was used in an undergraduate intro to topology class I took.  It is short, the text is incredibly concise to the point of being incomprehensible, the exercises are all fairly standard but range from  difficult to impossible since the text gives no examples or applications of  the theorems, and it tries to cover far too much material in too few pages.   Look for something by Munkres if you want to learn topology 
 A detailed examination of the full transcript of the presentations made in Detroit in '71 shows they are a mix of reasonable, questionable, and really off-the-wall statements.  One of the stars, Scott Camil, has made a lifelong career of outlandish claims, most recently that an entire village was massacred by Marines who wanted the US combat boots the natives had all somehow acquired.  Since the average VN foot size is several sizes smaller than US and villagers didn't like American boots anyhow, this is patently absurd.  (He had also proposed assassinating US Senators.)  None of the claims of atrocities could be confirmed by the military investigators who later contacted those testifying, all of whom refused to cooperate.  (Since they were already out of the military, they could not have been prosecuted for any such incidents, so they had no reason to stay silent.)  Accepting the film at its face value, no matter how dramatic and real its contents seem, is well beyond risky.  There were undoubtedly individual atrocities committed by US soldiers in Viet Nam, as there have been in every war by every side.  But there was never a policy of inciting or encouraging such, and in fact there were courts-martial of soldiers for such occurrences.  Where do we hear of the trials of VC/NVA for the 4000-odd citizens of Hue very deliberately rounded up and murdered during Tet '68?  If you want to believe the USA is the source of all evil in the world, buy this DVD and you'll get years of enjoyment from it.  Otherwise, buy books by Gunter Lewy or Harry Summers or Lewis Sorley 
 I just received this book from Amazon and was greatly dismayed to find that pages 119 - 150 are missing, and pages 89 - 118 are repeated in their place.  That's like Ford shipping a car with the engine installed in the trunk - what a basic mistake!  Now I have to go through the effort to return the book and wait 7 - 10 days for a refund after they get it back! 
 Thought the cards would be like Broderbund's American Gretings Creatacard Platinum 8 software but it was not and I did not like what I got. 
 The writer of this book has found the real threat to gays and lesbians:  radical Islam.  Really, what have Right Wing Christians ever done?  Nothing.  The NEA has more political power than Christians.  The Muslim aim is to take over the world and exterminate "infidels".  That's us.  That all of us.  The Christian right wing can't even stop graphic sex education at their local schools.  They are not a threat.  Heck, Christians are not a serious worry.  They are not a worry.  Do not buy this book.  It's obsolete.  The author, Bruce Bawer, says it's obsolete.  We can't ignore Islam.  Why?  All GLBT people will be eliminated by Islam.  That is a face.  Read Bruce Bawer's book "While Europe Slept."  We may actually want to be friends with Christians.  Why?  Islam means to destroy us all!  All good feminists should be worried. 
 The description advertises no power cord required, and the box has large print stating "No AC Power Needed".  Smaller print however notes that if you want the caller-id (which isn't back-lit) to function, that you need to provide 3 AA batteries.  The last thing I wanted was one more thing that required batteries 
 I'm sorry but David Horowitz was always an authoritarian, be it on the left or now on the right. The jump from Mao to George W. isn't as long as you'd think if you are looking for something to kneel before, something to banish thought or ambiguity. David Horowitz was one of the fellows who gave the left a bad name in the first place so it is particulary dishonest and repugnant that he should think his "conversion" tells any larger home truths about anything beyond his own pyschology and extremism. Frankly it says more about the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the right that they welcomed Horowitz than it does about a "left" that was well rid of such frightening blowhards. 
           Thankfully I got this book as part of a swap, and didn't pay anything more than postage for it. Cos it was a waste of Teri's time writing it, and a waste of my time reading it. I read to about page 50, and ended up even more depressed than I already was, so gave up.   This isn't a stereotypical biography. This is Teri Hatcher wallowing in self pity. Big time. It's nothing but saying how it's "tough" being a single mother, not getting many jobs until Desperate Housewives came along, how she didn't have any nookie with her husband on her honeymoon, how her husband doesn't love her, how's she divorced and over 40. Whoopee.   Don't buy this book. There's no juicy gossip about Lois & Clark (like, my favourite show ever!!!), and she's full of it. Blah, what a waste of time 
 "Silent Witness:..." by Roxanna Ferllini (Timms), NY, Firefly Books, 2002 - ISBN 1-55297-625-6 (pbk.), 7x10 in., 192 pg., has many photos; glossary, index & bibliography are short.  "SW:..." invitingly promises more than it gives:  It has an bold enticing cover, c. 300 ample-sized full-color photos of crime scenes, criminals, forensic trace evidences & diverse illustrations, etc., on premium stock semi-gloss paper -- obviously a very expensive printing, especially for paperback.  Table of contents lists 8 chapters:  History of Forensic Anthropology, Bone Talk, Exhumations, Surface Bodies, Altered Remains, Air Disasters, Fires/Explosives & Human Rights.  The talky text has many deficiencies: Throughout, it is overly rambling & verbose, i.e., (pg. 157) "Fingerprinting was one of the various processes utilized, and identifications were also made by molecular biologists who applied DNA analysis."  Why not say "DNA & fingerprints were used for identification" and use 7 instead of 20 words?  Author uses abject word choices, solecism or inaccuracies in medical/forensic phrasing as, i.e., (pg. 27) "since female humans are predisposed to pregnancy and childbirth" is non-comedic, corny.  Why not say "childbearing women" and use 2 not 9 words. And, (p. 31), "cygomatics" referencing cheekbones should be "zygomatics", but problematical is wandering & wayword use of medical/forensic jargon as might a lay person.  The author's credentials (MA in Biol. Anthro.) are restricted to a 2" small space on the inside back cover & indicates she worked with UK Foreign Office as Forensic Anthropologist in Kosovo and for UN in Rwanda, and her interest in facial reproduction, political conflicts, genocide, & human rights is notable & praiseworthy.  Thusly, her final Chapter 8 on Human Rights is the single textual useful strong point of "SW:..."  In summary, the book is geared to HS grade level of introductory forensics -- it has many excellent & remarkably good photographs & few hints of favorable text.  What this book needs is an insightful editor who could salvage the text of "SW:..." to gain more serious readership, but Chapter 8 is okay. 
 First, the review by Ed Cambell (above) is terribly unfair as he is listed in this book as assisting in the final product.  There are parts of the book where the chapter fails to address the "questions" that appear at the beginning of the chapter. So, some of it is incomplete. So, while the description of some chapters tell the reader what the chapter is about, you can finish the chapter and find that it did not live up to its description.  This is very odd.  Also, while the author has some very interesting insights, he interprets some lines of the palm is some fairly offbeat ways.  If you have been reading palms or have been reading a compendium of palmistry books, you will fine this book a little strange 
 "Rachel and Her Children" is an award-winning compilation of the author's conversations with homeless people, highlighting how the downtrodden suffer in the United States at the end of the 20th Century.  Jonathan Kozol pulls no punches in his one-sided indictment of the American way, putting the blame for homelessness squarely on the shoulders of everyone else (Americans with homes, that is, the rest of us).  Although much of what Kozol depicts is heart-rending, I would have welcomed a more balanced presentation of the homeless issue, not only discussing the shortcomings of a political and economic system that makes it difficult for the homeless to overcome their situation, but also indicating that the homeless bear a good deal of personal repsonsibility in their plight (making little to no effort to seek employment, avoiding or sometimes even refusing to accept the albeit limited help offered by government agencies, sinking further into poverty by irresponsibly having children whom they cannot afford to support, etc).  For those of you who want a stronger kick in the pants about the suffering of the poor than that provided by Jonathan Kozol, I suggest reading the essay of another Jonathan (Swift's "A Modest Proposal") 
 This book is based on on the opinion of the author and a few male "experts".  He bases his observations about women on his survey of a small group of church women who appear to represent the traditional role of the submissive stay at home wife and mother.  He never gives any other background of who these women are.  Dobson needs to wake up and realize that the traditional role of stay at home housewife is "history", even if the wife has chosen to stay at home and care for children.  Unless you are married with "traditional" roles you will likely be turned off by this book. I was. Some of Dobson's references in this book are so weak, as he seeks to show how men and women are so different from each other.  I believe that he has joined in the destuctive practice of seeking to look for how men and women are different rather than looking at our mutual needs like respect, emotional support, communication and loyalty. I gave this book one star because there are some parts that are interesting, it's just a shame that Dobson put this book out with the title it has.  Women and men should read this book with a very critical mind, if at all 
 Like the reviewer you will find below, I found the the first 75 pages boring.  It was all descriptive narrative and no real action--and describing the same thing over and over and over and over.  UNlike the reviewer below, however, I never found the remaining book as interesting as the first one by this author.  In my opinion we've got a one-trick pony, here 
 Here's a long but informative review! Naturally since Bogle is the only one writing about early Black film stars people believe everything he says. He plays it safe by always talking about the same ole' stars that he talked about in his last books. Never does he introduce the public to unsung talents we never heard of. He spends most of the time talking about how mulatto, how light or how dark such and such is and how such and such couldn't do this or that because of this or that. When whites write on their stars they don't write about how blonde, how brunette or how red head someone was and how Irish or Italian one looked. Which proves how stuck on skin color Blacks really are! Why do Blacks feel they always have to spend time talking about race instead of giving these stars their recognition and due, forgetting how they look and telling of their life and versatile careers, who they really were, where they come from, making one reading feel like they knew the person all their lives, make one feel the happiness and sadness. Bogle spends more time on what they didn't do then what they did do. Which is sad, the public is missing out on a lot. So again, do for yourself the research and don't' depend on others all the time.  Bogle loves talking about how white Fredi Washington looked instead of writing about her extensive, incredible career, she done more in her life then most of us could dream about it, she didn't let others prejudices hold her back. She was no tragic mulatto, another stupid name, minus well call Stepin Fetchit a tragic ni**er which he wasn't, he was the first black millionaire and no more of a stereotype then Black pimps, gangsters of today who are getting rich off of it like Step got rich off of his stereotype. Fredi will be the first to say she had a great life and career. She wasn't sad or confused but a strong black woman. Bogle is no better than a white writer who puts down a black but thinks its okay to coin a book Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks because he's black, I'm sure if a white titled a book that we be yelling racism, don't Black talents deserve a better title?   Bogle also plays it safe by always talking about Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, never telling the stories and never giving recognition to other black actresses like Nina Mae McKinney, Mildred Washington, Theresa Harris, Fredi Washington, Edna Mae Harris, Florence O'Brien, Louise Franklin, Daisy Bufford, Jeni LeGon Evelyn Preer, Suzette Harbin, Hilda Simms, Francine Everett, Shirley Haven and countless of others who had a chance to display their talents on the screen in Hollywood and helped fight discrimination and  help in the enhancement and betterment of blacks on screen but he gives all the credit to Horne and Dandridge, who didn't do as much as others if you want to get down to the truth, but I'm glad he don't talk about them in a way because he'll butcher up their life stories, I'll give them their due though. Many aren't remembered because maybe they didn't do as much, who cares about who has done more, were suppose to be remembering them for accomplishments and talents, right? White film historians sure remember all their stars, little or big. Someone like Louise Brooks, considered a early Hollywood icon is highly regarded as a great actress despite she only had a few good films and wasnt a big movie star. The woman is more remembered for one good film and a bobbed hairstyle but white historians will make sure you know her, her achievements and what she DID DO for the film industry.  Why can't Bogle be like that instead of criticizing everyone and judging them by white people's standards of what success and beauty is? I guess it's true that you gotta work twice as hard as whites to be someone in this world, whites can be remembered for little things, few successes, Blacks gotta have many successes to get rememberance and recognition even for other Blacks to remember them. Bogle is one of the few black film historians, you would think he would write more positively of blacks in Hollywood but he treats many worse then whites treated them when they were alive. Bogle never mentions Willie Covan and Marie Bryant (and appeared in movies also and was a good friend of Lena Horne's too) who choreograhed many white stars, they were behind the scenes but contributed to Hollywood. He suppose to be giving credit not taking away. Either Bogle is too lazy or likes to show favoritism because he sure won't tell other unsung talents stories. If he does he clutter it up with talking about their looks especially if he doesn't know how to write about them. Bogle knows nothing about the great career of Nina Mae McKinney, the first movie star of Hollywood and Europe, who done more films then any other black actress of her time, the first to appear on many magazines, she had so many achievements, yet he gives her one little page, if you don't know about a person, I rather you not write about them at all then to write lies. He never talks about the Black Cinema independent movie stars or the industry who was apart of American cinema, I guess their too hard for him to research, so he takes the easy path in writing about stars he already wrote about a million times. He never writes about Ethel Moses, Francine Everett, Dorothy Van Engle, Edna Mae Harris, Margaret Whitten, Tomiwitta Moore, Bee Freeman, Lorenzo Tucker, Monte Hawley, Ralph Cooper (created the first black studio in Hollywood), Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams and countless other black movie stars who appeared in films for blacks made by blacks in the 30's and 40's, I guess that's too mediocre for him but they done more for the enhancement of Blacks in movies by creating their own images, own roles, own portrayals, playing people from all walks of life unlike ones in Hollywood who were stuck playing the same types of roles and being the same images he always complaining about well I feel give due to ones who at least tried to do for themselves and become what they wanted but see they weren't cross-overs so their looked at as non-important by some which kind of dictated by whites who we should remembered and who's important. It's hard researching Black Cinema stars but boy it's worth it plus studying them, watching them perform gives you a good idea of who they were even if you can't find info on them. I still find the time to give them due and I'm no professional or anything but Bogle is a high class guy who only likes to write about Hollywood and his favorite gals Horne and Dandridge.   Ive done more research on unsung, forgotten stars then he has and it has been pleasurable teaching others on the net about blacks who contributed to stage and screen, stars who were just as important as Dandridge and Horne. I'm glad there are other people who are taking it upon themselves to tell the true stories of many unsung black legends and don't write in the same fashion as Bogle. Anyone who is hung up on skin color and don't want to think outside the box and like to hear the same stories then Bogle is for you but someone like me who researched many early black stars of stage and screen on my own and found out the real deal, found how they really were, found how they were really looked at, and found the true stories wouldn't appreciate Bogle's work much. I've talked with some legendary Blacks of the early years, some of their relatives also and they gave a completely different view then how Bogle describes them which shows he just goes by hearsay and documents and don't do accurate interviewing and researching.  I would think Bogle would spend more time on talking about the beauty of  black women from dark to light and  their wonderful achievements to the world.  Black women are quite unique but instead Bogle tells the  story of black women from white people's perspective it seems, he tells how black women were looked at from whites perspective not from a true black person's perspective that has pride for his race, maybe Bogle has a white person's way of thinking who is partial. Because I would commend these women, embrace and make the world embrace their beauty, courage, and talents; their many gifts to the world isn't as nearly written about as their skin tones are. He loves spending time writing about how light, dark or mulatto someone looks. Again, he makes it seem like such and such suffered because she was mulatto, light or dark, come on man, if she had a tragic life it was her own fault if she suffered. He makes it seem like color and race was the problem for everything which is false, actually many of these women profited from the race sometimes and plus women in general face discrimination, no matter what race or color. Don't you think these women went through enough being judged by skin tone or looks, they wished in their life for being to judge their talent, at least give them that now, Bogle doesn't. Who isn't discriminated against in this world? Bogle makes it look like Black is a curse when these female performers change the world and introduce the world to their greatness and the greatness of the race. He loves talking about whether someone should of passed for white or not like when he's talking about the great Fredi Washington. He misses out on showcasing  other great talents like Valaida Snow, Blanche Calloway, Una Mae Carlisle, Eunice Wilson, Adelaide  Hall and  others but that's okay because they have  been written  beautifully about by other writers. Well, many are dead so they cant stick up for themselves and Bogle takes advantage of that, he hasn't even interviewed or actually talked to ones who he writes about, he just goes by hearsay. Have your favorites but when you write a book, you can't show favoritism which he does all through which hurts others who has a story to tell but he only give honor to his faves. It seems no black can make him happy, he always has something to criticize. In his words every Black woman is a tragic, confused mulatto and every black man is a coon, or some other stereotype, he wouldn't say that to the young black guys or gals in entertainment today though, he takes advantage of the dead who can't stick  up for themselves.  There is a website on unsung black talents of stage and screen, you all will enjoy. http://www.angelfire.com/jazz/ninamaemckinney/ 
 I really didn't enjoy the movie, but  I had to finish it.  The hypocrisy of Faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the so-called fundamentalist that I know, but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying.   This movie presented a very perverted view of Christianity.  Though there was alot of talking about Jesus and saying His name, it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually KNEW HIM and spent time with Him.  When Mary gets a revelation from something she believes is Christ that opposed the actual Word of God, she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision.  Christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against His Word.  No one actually reads a Bible in the movie.  Consequently, most made many life-damaging decisions.   I hated the "reality" of the movie, but it has challenged me to actually spend time with Christ and learn about Him. I shudder to think that I could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what Christianity truly is.  
 Initially intrigued with this book, I quickly lost interest.  It starts out well but then degenerates into a bunch of random points which the author tries to use to argue his hypothesis that the universe was designed to give rise to intelligent life as a final outcome.  The blurbs along the margin were major distractions & made it hard to stay focused on the actual material in the book.  The book just kind of wanders around the various fields of science trying to find evidence to support the author's premise and then ends with the pronouncement that we're the peak of creation (very Genesis-like).  I'd have to pronounce this book mildly interesting if you can wade through the claptrap and the biased agenda 
 Turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose, months after I gave up on it. I have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and T-o-C is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. I struggled, oh how I struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. I stirred the pages wildly while I waited for the plot to thicken. I fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. I searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if I had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. I left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. I offered it to my  neighbor so he could jack up his car. I considered lighting the fire with it. I wondered whether, if I took just a few pages a day, I could eat it and get rid of the evidence. I offered it to my mother-in-law for Christmas. I took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt. And then, eventually, voila! The rattling door! What a fine tome T-o-C is. Another few hundred pages [...] and I could have used it as a sea anchor for the Titanic 
 I was on a website reading about the current Mid East happenings (I am working in Kuwait now), and a banner ad talked about Nostradamus and world war 3 starting in 2007. Well I came to Amazon and came across this book, its one of the few that have reader comments on it. Then I read the excerpt : "Whereas prophecies up until this century have claimed that Israel and the Promised Land would be settled seven years prior to the arrival of the Messiah, this book proves that the advent period is, in fact, forty-two years, not seven. This discovery dates the settlement to the end of the Six-Day War in 1967, and indicates that the Messiah will therefore come in the year 2009." Does any of that passage raise an eyebrow? It does for me. Israel was made a country around 1947/8 I thought so where does this writer come up with using 1967? Well there's one explanation that I would believe, IT'S TO SELL A BOOK! Another comment, someone here said the world will be at war if our US leaders have their way, HUH? So our current leaders WANT world war 3? Please take a deep breath and go out of your apartment (maybe find a big park and walk around and look around, you've been cooped up on fringe web sites too long bouncing hate against others and its magnifying inside you). Did you think that the trade center bombing in 1993 was done by people who had a right to do it, and that the 9/11 attacks were a conspiracy by Bush? I really hope that your all talk and don't vote because the leaders you would put in power will probably empower more of this terror upon our western society. As for the book, I'll pass, thanks. 
 Like others commenting here, I purchased the Simmons Extraordinaire because I live in an apartment and did not want to buy a bed that would be difficult to move when I go to a new place.  I used this bed for about eight months, and had a plethora of problems.  The edge of the stamping on the pillowtop began to separate and create tiny holes.  As a result, oftentimes I'd wake up on the hard floor because the mattress lost its air and flattened.  The valve went bad in a short period of time, and the mattress required me to refill it after sleeping on it a couple of times.  And like another commenter, the interior membrane busted, leaving a huge bump in the middle of the pillowtop.  I tried to deflate it to lessen the bump and flipped the mattress over, but my back felt as if it'd be run over by a car.  Customer service has been somewhat irresponsive, thou  I strongly recommend avoiding this product.  Unfortunately, it won't last long.  If you're looking for an air bed, spend a little bit more money on a higher-rated brand that will hold up 
 "Blind Alley" is the fifth novel in the continuing story of Eve Duncan, forensic sculptor, Joe Quinn, Atlanta police detective and Jane MacGuire, their precocious seventeen year old adopted daughter rescued from the streets. Be warned that much of this review might be construed as spoilers but I'm betting that it's not going to matter much since you'll likely be giving the book a pass anyway!   I used to treat Iris Johansen as a sure thing! You know what I mean - the kind of author whose new title you'd add to your reading list without even caring what the plot line was or you'd pick up a copy at the store without even bothering to flip open the dust jacket for a peek! "Blind Alley" buried that thought - cold, deep and fast! It was a great deal more than just bad - it was truly painful!   A shadowy serial killer named Aldo is on the loose slaughtering women in a most unseemly, gruesome fashion. Carving their living faces right off their skulls, Aldo imagines himself responsible for the systematic elimination of all women who resemble Cira, a courtesan/actress/prostitute killed two thousand years ago in the town of Herculaneum when Vesuvius erupted. It would seem that Aldo is a little upset at having lost the love and attention of his father, an archeologist who became obsessed with Cira when he discovered her statue and some details of her life.   As if that isn't deep enough in left field as the premise for a thriller, imagine the eyebrows you'll raise when you read that Jane MacGuire, Eve Duncan and Joe Quinn's adopted 17 year old daughter is a ringer for Cira. Not only does she find herself stalked by Aldo but some inexplicable psychological attachment to Cira plagues Jane with regular nightmares in which she is trapped in caves or tunnels fleeing for her life from the eruption of Vesuvius.   It doesn't end there - Johansen tosses Mark Trevor into the mix. He's a con and an antiquities smuggler (picture Lovejoy with a nasty streak!) who had a run-in with Aldo and is intent on killing him. To that end he intrudes himself into Eve Duncan's and Joe Quinn's life and sets himself up as Jane's protector. Now, I'm no prude but the scene in which Trevor, a grown man at least as old as Joe, has a near sexual encounter with Jane, a typical seventeen year old teenager with respect to her hormones and sexuality, is just plain distasteful and, frankly, scored well into the red zone on the "yuk" meter!   There is just so much wrong with this novel, it's difficult to know where to begin and where to stop - nightmares that start, happen and end with no explanation or psychological development at all; unlike any previous Johansen novel I've read, the characters and dialogue seem trite, wooden and completely contrived; the outcome of Mark Trevor as a character is left spectacularly un-resolved; Eve Duncan's obsession with her murdered daughter, Bonnie, continues unabated and is definitely becoming downright irritating; a wonderful sub-plot concerning Eve's forensic reconstruction of a real skull from the Vesuvius eruption was simply deep-sixed!   I still own a few Johansen titles that I haven't read so there is perhaps hope. But she'll have to prove to me that she hasn't jumped the shark before I'll spend another cent on a new title!   Paul Weiss 
 Perhaps it's unfair of me to rate this book, since I didn't make it to the end.  It was disappointing, since I've liked others of Coover's books.  This one is written in a stream of consciousness style reminiscent of James Joyce/"Ulysses" (which I liked a lot).  Similarly, it also is incredibly literate and erudite, lots of language play which still somehow was mostly just hard and not fun the way language should and can be.  I could appreciate the humor intellectually, but it wasn't really funny.  The subject matter is a cynical take on a dark subject, the Rosenberg executions.  I can certainly understand why its release was so contoversial.  It might help to know more about the period but as someone who came of political age (later) during the Watergate years I know little about Nixon as VP and many of the social references were lost on me 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 I was hoping for a book that would illuminate some choices for baby names, while pointing out any unfortunate associations I had not thought of.  Only to receive a book that was short on credible information, and long on personal judgement.  I was truly disappointed in the seemingly arbitrary way in which the authors claimed some names to be outdated.  While I understand that Cherry could be a torment to a young girl, lumping Cheri and Cheryl in with these was absolutely silly.  Having grown up in the eighties with that name, I was never once called a name referring the former.  Asking two friends - a Cheri, (ten years younger than myself) and a Cheryl, (four years older) if they had ever been teased in that way, they both laughed and said no.  Many times the author's reasons for dissuading parents from choosing a name seem to be based only on the author's personal preferences and peccadilloes.   I found that many of the names the authors' gave their seal of approval to, were names that were probably most trendy at the moment they were writing.  They blithely recommend, good god... California?  Not realizing that place names, (like Brooklyn, etc.) are already being ridiculed as tired and silly in magazines.  No doubt in a year or two, they'll be recommending Apple and other fruit names, once they too are no longer trendy.    The most unfortunately thing is that the author's emphasis on trendy or common names, may warn parents off of some unique and delightful older names.  In the end I could have saved myself the price of the book and done the name research on the internet. 
 This book goes into the hearts and minds of the ancient Greeks led by Odysseus and Achilles, who are guided by their gods. The Trojan War is brewing for the Greeks and thoughts of slaughtering their enemy, The Trojans are very strong. Can the Trojans survive? Will they all live to tell the tale of the Trojan War or will they all be killed?  On both sides, it's life or death on their minds. Have you ever heard of the Trojan horse and the victory for Odysseus? This book includes the story of Odysseus and why his son set out to find his father. The journey of the ancient Greeks to the Trojan homeland is included. Will they return or will they lie in the blood stained desert of the Trojan homeland? The book also includes Odysseusis treacherous journey home past a six headed serpent and right across an evil king's door step. Will he survive?  Personally I didn't like the book at all. The way it was written it didn't really pull the reader in very well and the battle sequences are O.K. but not the best. Personally I don't really enjoy some types of myths and legends. I think if you are just about to branch out and read Greek myths you shouldn't read this book first because it really turns you off to Greek myths in general, so don't think all Greek myth's are like this.  	 	 	 
 If you are interested in reading an insipid Marxist-inspired tirade the substance of which appears to be that urban fires in the United States have been (a) the consequence of oppressors oppressing the oppressed, (b) the opportunity for the oppressors to further oppress the oppressed, or (c) both (a) and (b), read this book!  If, on the other hand, you are interested in reading about urban history and the impact of great fires upon our cities, do yourself a favor and let this pass into the dustbin of publishing history.  Let me offer one gem that perfectly epitomizes this inane book and its author.  This is how a "distinguished" Professor at the University of Georgia (listening parents?) describes looting (aka "stealing") in the Detroit riots of 1967:  "Looting was appropriation, whether one saw it as a crime or as recouping what discrimination in salaries and job opportunities had taken..."   And then Professor Marx goes on to contrast arson unfavorably with such noble looting because "Fire does not transfer wealth or redistribute goods".    The book is unreadable. 
 this book was boring because it demeans fetishes. fetishes can be healthy outpourings of one's soul, not something that needs to be hidden away in the proverbial closet.  i have a foot fetish, and this book gave me the  impression that fetishes are to be spurned: i disagree and disagree  strongly.  my fetish is something integral to my being; i live for feet 
 While I am not qualified to pass judgement on sculpture as far as methods of actually creating works of art,as a art foundry owner,I have reasonable background in usage of diferent materials connected with sculpture. I found this book to be of rather limited use to anyone seeking information on materials in use today. Almost all refererences are very dated and may be considered useful if a study of yesteryear's practices are intended.It appears to me,that information on various metals and their processing  in particullar is more or less imprecise and in some cases wrong altogethrer-for example:to aneal common aluminium alloy to "pink" heat means going past melting point!To sum up,if you intend to learn current practices, go elsewhere 
 Maybe no one noticed but towards the end of the movie when the Russian President and Jack Ryan are talking to each other through the computer, repeat is spelled "reapeat".  On top of that, the acting was horrible...this movie didn't take itself seriously enough.  Ben Affleck sucked as much as he did in this movie as he did in Pearl Harbor 
 The key in the book is How to Find your Mission in Life, well after reading this thing several times, I found it as unhelpful as the first read.  Quite honestly it is full of feel good platitudes, which are not only Christian, and no roadmap.  If you really want to find your mission perhaps try the other book, Parachute, the 2007 edition is superb 
 i have not  yet receive this book and it been so long and i'm still waiting.  i hoping to here from you guis soon ..bye   lucien pierre j 
 My kids started reading the Left Behind Kids books, and because I was concerned about the message and theology of the books, I started reading them also.  Then I decided to check out the "adult" books from the library.   I am a born-again, pentacostal believer in Jesus Christ, and parts of the theology are not what I read in the Bible.  OK.  I can stil enjoy a good book, one with interesting characters, realistic dialogue, and a good plot.  The issue of plot is difficult for the Left Behind books, I admit, because we know who wins if we've read the end of the New Testament.  As to the rest, it fell flat.  Most of the dialogue didn't ring true.  After a few of the books, I was interested in some of the characters, but by the end of the books, there were only a few of the original characters left, and they were some of the least interesting to begin with.  How many times do we have to read through the same sermons from the exact same scriptures in Revelation?  How many times do they have to tell us about the almost affair that someone had back in Book 1?  There is nothing new and interesting in this book. The last book is just boring.    It would have been nice, at the end of the book, to wrap up everything.   Jesus comes back, and everyone should be reunited at the end after the battle is over, right?  Some of the characters that were important early in the books are either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all.  It was an incredible let down.  I felt like I had invested in these books only to see what life would be like for everyone after the battles are over.  Nothing.  We stick with that one main guy, and everyone else is left in the dust.  It should have had a really, really happy ending, but even that was boring.  If I had my time back, I would stick to the kid versions, if only to discuss theological issues with my children.  At least in the kid books, the sermons are shorter.  And I will know not to get my hopes up for happy reunions at the end of the series 
 I agree with the person who called this book psychobabble. The story rambles and pretty much goes nowhere--old bromides in an reused package. This journey was an unsuccessful vehicle to deliver the wisdom of the ages. Dorothy discovered There's no place like home! on the way to Oz in a much more compelling story. So did the friends she picked up along the way. People who like the fantasy genre would undoubtedly enjoy it more than I did. A waste of time; good thing it was so short. Two stars because it was totally clean, otherwise only one 
 Paula is a woman who is way out of touch with reality and is just really looking to sell her own products. She does say that these are her opinions. A person's opinions mean very little to me because like rear ends everyone has one. And in Paula's case, her opinions mean nil. I tried some of the products from her line and found them to be quite blah. She really needs to tell people in her book not to buy the garbage she sells. The only way to find out if a product works for you or not is to get some samples and try it out. There is no mass recipe for skin care, it is trial and error. All skin is different and no two people are alike. Just because something works for a friend, doesn't mean it will work for you. And Paula ain't your friend so I don't know why anyone bothers to listen to her. She has drummed a nice profit out of her little books, emerging into her own website with products she has for sale. Wake up people 
 The idea is good - admitted. But there is the problem of getting it into a novel. All the characters lack credibility, their motivations are not logical. The main character's tasks are ludicrous and the atmosphere is created in a cheap way - a way that the author thinks is traditional for the genre. The plot is improbable - which would be understandable for a horror novel -, but unmotivated and does not have anything to do with the main action. In addition it is a mixture of gore and porn, no I am not prude, but too much is too much. After finishing the novel I asked myself why I read it to the end. It could have been such a nice story. How far does a person go to get rich? There is a lot of power in this question. But in this book it is dealt with in such an absurd way that you do not answer it any more 
 This is not a good book for learning Java3D.  The author buries Java3D in so many layers of his own code that you can't even recognize it.  The one useful idea I got from the book was to not compile the scene graph so that I can add and delete objects from the scene during run time. Skip this book, the Java tutorial is better and its free 
 This book was atrocious. I read fairly fast so despite how bad the book is I try to finish. However this book was unreadable. The story line was boring, the characters... shallow. The worst part is the poor sentence structure and vocabulary used by the characters.  I rolled my eyes more times than pages. 
 My bike did not come with an instruction manual. This seems to be a recurring problem with this company 
 Although well-researched, this book is really little more than a book of quotations lifted from several primary sources. The result is rather monotonous and fails to provide the detail and context that makes those primary sources so informative. A much better idea is to simply read the memoirs written by the men who were actually there (and there are plenty of them). They provide much greater insight into the life of a German Landser than this second-hand account 
 Ansay gives us an anguished portrait of families trapped in a cycle of violence, stifled by religion and small-town culture. Ellen bucks the system by being a working mom, but when her husband loses his job must move in with her in-laws, and is exposed to their vitriol and dark secrets. This book is disturbing on a number of levels, and not for entertainment at all. I found the story extremely realistic but the ending all the more unsatisfying because although Ellen plans to escape, it leaves the guilty unpunished and the scars to her children unhealed. I'd rather have a happy ending,and I finished this book feeling sick. Two stars for gritty realism, but this isn't "light reading" or entertaining at all. Be warne 
 Here's a quick summary of the book--Everything that google does is wonderful and google has changed the world as we know it. Come on. How about a little more impartiality. How about going more into privacy and IP issues? I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, but I would not recommend buying it 
 The crib tent did not fit our crib.  It's not deep enough or long enough. I called to try and send it back and they do not allow this item to be returned. I am very disatisfied with this company and the product. 
 I was able to track the progress of this item, and it took almost two weeks AFTER the order request hit the warehouse for for the item to be shipped.  I also paid for 2 Day shipping and once the item shipped it took 3 days to get to me 
 I'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face (same would go if I were reviewing The Fear of Flying or A Room of One's Own, both of which are far superior to this outing, although of different genres), but I'll go ahead and write one anyways. Nafisi's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in Tehran didn't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work. Nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students. I know I may get lambasted for saying so, but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion. Instead, we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general. The layers of interpretation for a character such as Humbert is simplified to either he's a villian or a misunderstood villian, neither of which deals with many of the nuances Nabakov has included. You would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students. The strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the West who comes back to Iran to teach. I think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context, yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave English professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country. On a more stylistic level, I was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text, as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them, actually become a massive blob without much indivuality. I had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another. Her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else, even though he does play an important role, although a subtle one in many scenes. I think I expected a lot from this novel that I couldn't get from picking up a newspaper and I didn't get much beyond that. 
 Others have drawn attention to Hertzberg's civil tone. We have all become accustomed to discourse via amplified insult; measured voices such as Hertzberg's are refreshing indeed. Having said this, it amounts to nothing more than a shame. When a leftist advances his argument with the typical manic lunacy, we may simply dismiss him as a fool. Hertzberg, however, cannot be so dismissed. He is bright and learned. Unfortunately, he's got it all wrong. All the facts are on the table, and the judge appears to be fair. Yet the judgment is random and chaotic - the judge has added it up as if following a different arithmetic altogether. After reading Hertzberg's work, one has the queasy feeling one gets watching news coverage of the person dragged off to the asylum, leaving puzzled neighbors in his wake saying "he seemed so normal." Something's gone wrong, and no one can quite figure out how it happened. A shame, indeed 
 It took me less than a day and a half to read this book. And thats not because i was "glued to it" or "thought it was a real page-turner" but basically because it was a real fast read. However, this book, as i stated, is a perfect example of Stephen King's boredom with writing horror/fiction. His work within the last decade especially, has taken some well deserved criticism. Based on the concept that most of his recent books are churned out in a "cookie-cutter" method. Now, don't get me wrong, King is responsible for some of the most compelling stories ever. Stories that seem to transcend the "horror genre", and incorporate elements of mystery, romance, and drama. However, this is not one. I would rate this book only behind "Insomnia" as the most insipid King novels i've ever read. I don't know how to explain it to those who have not read most of King's work. But for those who have, it will make sense when i say that about a quarter of the way into the book, i found myself thinking "oh....it's going to be another one of THESE stories huh?" THESE meaning a really generic character, and a foreseeable "generic" villian, ultimately squaring off in a very "generic" ending. halfway through, i could already see how it was going to end. And this is one of those books where King's references to East coast culture are going to take precedence over the quality of the finished product. Some examples of King's finest work would be "The Talisman", "Night Shift"(THE best collection of short horror stories ever), The Shining, The "Dark Tower" sieries, and The Stand, just to name a few. And if you have not read any of "The Bachman books" (King as Bachman) "Rage", "The Long Walk", Road Work", and "The Running Man", are some of the most well written, and mind-bending stories ever told.  This, however, isn't. And unless you can purchase this book for under $2.00 don't waste your money, or your time.       
 I grew up reading the Chip Hilton books and loved every one of them.  A few years back, Claire Bee's daughter and her husband decided to bring them back, which was a great idea.  Unfortunately, they also decided to update the books.  If you want a great sports book for kids, find the original versions of these books and read them, instead of these updated versions.  You can tell the originals from the fakes by looking at the author's name on each book.  The originals were written by Claire Bee, the fakes are by him, his daughter and others.  One of the things I always enjoyed about the books was that they were written at a time when the rules in sports were quite a bit different than they are today.  In football, for example, if the other team scored you had a choice between having them kick off to you, or you kicking off to them.  The strategies and formations were a lot different too, and of course back in those days people still talked about good sportsmanship and it was important.  The updated books don't make much sense, since they are still using the old strategies and rules, but the books are set in modern times 
 Don't waste your money on "Listen and Learn French" - the "teacher" actually sounds like an old voice over from the 50's or 60's (and sounds kind of angry).  I couldn't listen for more than 10 minutes - no value added.  Spend the extra couple bucks for Drive Time French - those cd's are awesome 
 Despite of having the hand of a true great director at the helm and a multi-star cast (including a top-notch soundtrack by U2), the movie lacks the rhythm and charisma needed to live up to its expectations, with great performances lost in a bad script. It's just a wanna-be art movie, and nothing else 
 I love the Stephanie Plum series but this was a dud. Normally I can finish one of the series in a day, but I couldn't even make it through half of this novella. I'm going to try again someday, but I'd say, just move on to the next book...You'll be much more satisfied 
 I'm a fan of Dave Barry, I enjoy his column, I enjoyed some of his books in the past, and I bought this one with great anticipation. Boy was I disappointed! The story is meaningless, the characters are not interesting, the events are mostly dumb and the dialog is uneven and unfunny.  Do yourself a favor, do not read this book! I can't believe anyone recommends it 
 Just STOP listening to music altogether. PLEASE, PLEASE JUST STOP SMOKING HIS POLE AS WELL, ITS CLEARLY EVIDENT IN YOUR REVIEW.  To everyone else, listen to all of Eminem's albums before this one. Actually you probably have unless you live in a bubble.  That is all 
 Mike Davis, in an interview, admitted that he does not let the facts stand in the way of his arguments. City of Quartz demonstrates this tendency to the fullest. In a previous work, Davis pulled a passage out of a work of fiction and cited it as fact. He shows similar inventiveness in this work, citing studies that were never conducted, inventing interviews, and displaying a creativity with statistics that would be admirable if it weren't for the frightening fact that many who have read this work found it "incisive."   Those who applaud this work do so because it supports their politics. Those who attack it do so because it does not. I tried to remain neutral while reading, but when I read the book I found the inaccuracies to completely outweigh any points made by Davis. His purposeful and methodical deception does more harm than good to his cause.   For more information on this work, see an article at: (...) I would steer clear of Mike Davis and his blatant distortions of the truth 
 I enjoyed using this product because I liked the tingling from the mint - not necessarily a good thing, actually rather meaningless to the appearance and cleanliness of my face.  The Kaolin and Bentonite are drying agents, peppermint is harsh on sensitive skin.  If you separate out the so-called natural ingredients, you are left with the same basic stuff that any other cosmetics company uses.  And if it doesn't come straight out of the ground, it ain't natural anymore!  I give it a 2 because I was a sucker for the tingling, not because I saw any improvement in my skin's texture, look, or feel 
 jessica lange won an oscar for this, proof positive that some years are so bereft of strong performances, they HAVE to give it to somebody. apart from that, this is a silly exercise in anti-government paranoia, with a wasted tommy lee jones and not much else. 
 I liked this workout the first time I bought it as her fatburning workout.  The second time I bought it re-packaged I thought it was a fluke. This time I bought this since it sounded more like weight training and less like circuit training, so it must be different.  Nope.  I have 5 Kathy Smith videos, all three with different titles and covers only three different contents. I feel this is highly unethical and contacted her company.  One month later and I have yet to receive a response.  
 I had never read a Lucy Monroe book before.  I bought 3 of them at once  based on the good reviews they got.  I read 'The Real Deal' and really enjoyed it so I immediately started in on 'And Able.'  Am I the only one that noticed carbon copy scenes and dialogue from her previous book???  A lot of authors use a formula for their books, I just don't remember one that uses almost word for word lines of dialogue and identical scenes in 2 different books.  I had an order for a 4th Lucy Monroe book but have canceled it because it would be more of the same old stuff that I've already read 
 I certainly would not recommend this book to anyone as a first Kellerman's novel. There are too many medical jargons and terms as if Kellerman is trying to show off his medical knowledge. There are just too many unnecessary references to either the rarer or more serious and feared disorders unrelated to the story and thus causing a lot of side tracking which to me is a pure waste of time reading and boring to readers especially those with medical knowledge. It took me a long long time to finish this novel and thought of discarding it numerous times even when I was more than half way through the novel! This is especially so after having read the very exciting Robert Crais's "Demolition Angel" followed by Lee Child's "One Shot".  The story in this book are also full of loop holes and I cannot buy the idea of a Conspiracy Club using Jeremy to get to the killer and allowing more murders to take place while he was stressfully doing so. However, I must admit that I did enjoy reading a couple of Kellerman's other novels "Murder Book" & "When the Bough Breaks" quite some time ago 
 As a filmmaker and actor, I was looking forward to reading this book to clarify and enlighten me on different aspects of an overall project.  How enlightened I was when I got to page 15 and read about how to get along with a producer: "Do whatever he sugggests that you do together, right up to having sex with him."  I kept reading thinking this was a joke or an anecdote but no, the author continues condoning doing everything necessary to foster a conducive working relationship with the producer and the cast and crew as well.  I shut the book at that point and sent it back.  The author's admonishment that in Hollywood this is part of the process of networking and getting a film made and that if one doesn't agree with it, one should find another line of work is nothing short of asinine and totally out of line.  I'm confused; did these other reviewers not read this chapter?  Are they his students?  There's even a foreword by Robert Zemeckis.  Did he not read this chapter?  Even on a technical level, the Preproduction Chapter is not at all about anything a filmmaker needs to do in preproduction.  I've made a number of award winning short films and I can tell you, kissing my producer's fanny or otherwise is not something I've ever had to do.  And we've all gotten along just fine 
 Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling. 
 The Wisdom of Menopause provides an accurate description of what happens to a woman's body during and after ovarian failure (menopause). This book describes in detail the negative effects of menopause (ovarian failure) while still describing it as a natural and normal process to embrace. I don't believe we should be so willing to allow our ovaries to fail, instead we should look for ways to help them work better and for longer. 
 I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read.  I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability.  The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it.  As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting.  I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable.  
 I have used a lot of software, but I do not remember using much that is as difficult to use or learn than Quickbooks.  I have learned it over time, but there seem to be several functions in it that could be done in fewer steps.  I would not upgrade unless I absolutely had to.  The program is usable, but I am not interested in investing a lot more money in it.  It works for my small business, but I could still probably get by with Quicken, as I do not write checks on it.  I do kind of wish I had stayed with Quicken.  The most annoying thing about the program was that I was going credit card data downloads in Quicken, but when I changed to Quickbooks, it would not let me download data from my Quicken credit card, it wanted me to switch to a Quickbooks credit card, or ask permission of all my credit card providers.  I appreciate the security, but since both programs are made by the same company, this just seemed like a scam 
 This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who.  Unfortunately, they give away plot developments not only for this book but also for sequels in the Palliser Novels, of which Can You Forgive Her? is the predecessor to this work.  This seems altogether unforgivable, so I recommend you seek out another edition.  The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen.. 
 I can't believe I wasted as much time as I did on this book.  This is perhaps one of the worst slap-together-a-story jobs in recent publication.  I was looking for a slice of NY life, and what I got was no Big Apple--just a rotten apple.  Does anyone want to buy my copy (only about 3/4 read and slightly vomit stained) 
 I had not read Ted Dekker until I read his collaboration with Frank Peretti with the recent "House".  I really liked that book so I was looking forward to reading more by Dekker.  Unfortunately this was the one I read next and I was very disappointed.  It was hokey.  I'm hoping that some of his others are better 
 I don't know who wrote the 5 star reviews of this book, but they're like those actors in bad TV ads claiming that they lost 100 pounds in 8 weeks. Those rave reviews are hard to stomach. This is a really bad book--I agree with the person who said that they would give it zero stars if they could (half the book IS empty blank pages for your journaling). There is not much that's helpful in this book. Much better and thorough are (1)  The Thyroid Solution by Ridha Arem, (2) Living with Autoimmune Disease by Mary J. Shomon, & (3)Thyroid Power by Richard L. Shames and Marilee Halo Shames. These books are better researched and are compassionately and well-written by M.D.'s and/or persons with personal experience with thyroid problems.  Skip this book by Dirgo 
 "When will it end?? NEVER! MUWHAHAHAHAHA!"  REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*****  First off, up until this point, I found the series moderately entertaining (especially the 2nd book). Granted, in every book, there are certain aspects of Jordan's redundant writing that are very annoying. For instance, the childish, and extremely immature thoughts and actions of the female characters. Realistically, in a time period like that, if a woman acted as arrogant and sexist as they do in this book series, they would get a good "thumping" and be forced to learn from their mistakes (As would anyone really). Instead, the men grovel like slaves around the women. It's very annoying and infinitely un-realistic. Even in fantasy, there are certain rules one must follow pertaining to the characteristics of the human race. Hardly anyone in this series of books makes a rational, practical decision. There is hardly any Logic here, and when someone who is supposedly "Wise" speaks up, its merely common sense that hopefully everyone in real life should, and probably does know. Most of the so-called "intellectual" sayings in this book bassically translate to somthing a 10 year-old kid would know.  Human characteristics aside, Jordan has a great attention to detail when it comes to scenery (Clothing, geography, battle fields etc...) Hardly anything is left out. I suppose this is good, if one really wants to leave the real world and become part of the reality that Jordan has created.   But here we are...at the 5th book. I hate to say it, but not enough happened in the time-line to justify 5 long books. Sometimes, it is hard to tell just how much time has passed from one point to another. Jordan has virtually no sense of time at all in these books. This can either be as an excuse for such a long series, or its just basically poor writing. I'm a little undecided on that.   This book is full of the usual aspects that the previous 4 had:  1. Most of the men can't think for themselves (However there are a number of Characters that I do like allot. Uno, Julian, Matt, Asmodean, Lan, Thom, Loial (Who isn't even in this one..go figure) What happened to Elays?? Uhg..  2. The female characters whine and complain like my 2 year old daughter  3. Rand's increase in the One Power, is directly proportional to how much of a complete idiot he is turning into. It all started when he absolutely refused to believe he was the Dragon Reborn (End of Book 1 I believe). It takes him a number of books to finally stop being so damn immature and finally step up, and take action. This is the ultimate annoying aspect in this series. Rand attains the 'Sword that cannot be touched'. A weapon that can level cities...What does he do? Shoves it into the floor at the Stone Of Tear, and scampers off into the woods for another adventure. Wow..smart huh?   4. The Forsaken are scheming as usual. It's a mystery to me that they were picked by the Dark One. Powerful as they may be, they're mostly stupid, too paranoid, and un-trustworthy of one another. It would make more sense to create a truce and simply eliminate Rand. They could. Everyone knows they could. But they don't...Frustration level ever increasing...  This series seems to remind me of a poorly written play with too many characters to have on stage at any given time. Jordan seems to shove various ones on for certain amounts of time, then shove them off, with hardly a word of goodbye.   Something that I must point out is the way Jordan decides to kill off, or deal with the "Evil" characters. This whole re-incarnation nonsense is spoiling the importance, and fear of death. I believe it is wrong to kill off so many "Evil" characters at one time. Characters that have potential are eliminated.  And yes...Asmodean. Here comes my biggest gripe of all.. I rather liked Asmodean, his character was interesting, and it was rather refreshing to have someone cross over from the "Evil" side, to "Good" side (Even if it was un-willingly). He does provide a lot of insight for Rand. If I was a Forsaken, I would defiantly cross over to Rand's side, it only makes sense. BUT...Instead of keeping Asmodean alive and allowing him to help Rand with his great struggle...He's killed off at the end of the book.   Right there, Jordan drops a huge amount of story potential, and trades it for the same, un-inventive, one-sided drivel that the rest of this book contains. Then Rand goes on to Kill Rhavin. Another interesting Character wasted. Lanfear has also been killed (as far as we know). Again, another interesting character wasted. I could care less about Moraine. After the first book, her character is basically rendered useless, and is completely unneeded.   All in all, Jordan has a tendency to do away with the interesting characters (Hurin, Ingtar, Elays etc..) And keep the boring, immature ones. (Nynaeve, Egwene, Elayne, Aviendha etc...)   The series is simply too long, and I'm positive it has over 1000 pages of material that needs to be discarded. If Lord of Chaos is as bad as this one, I'm burning my collection and sending the remains to Jordan's house.   So, to those who are in the midst of this series like I am, I say to you; 'Welcome back my friends, to the show that never ends'.  
 I purchsed this book a few years ago, and the music is too simplified, especially on her hit songs.  If you really love to play, the book is worth it for the instrumental pieces, in which the music is more beautiful  anyway.  But for the most part it is horribly transcribed 
 This is a bubble gum type of book that does not teach anything about making money on the markets. It is a platform to sell Investor Business Daily services. If you want to learn trading look for articles written by Toby Crabel or Arthur Merrill, even Linda Raschke. They are full time professional money managers that happend to write few articles... some of them you can probably find on Ebay for cheaper... 
 Does Peter Coyote desperately need money?  Made side by side with Return of the Living 4: Necropolis for the Sci-Fi Channel, Return of the Living Dead 5: Rave to the Grave makes the aforementioned film look like Casablanca.  The surviving teens from the last film are here again, now in college, and apparently they have no memory of the events that took place bcause they look shocked when they first see the undead, and make some just plain dumb decisions in the process.  Whatever the reason behind the direction of the story, said story revolves around another cannister found, and a few kids making a rave drug out of it called, you guessed it, Z.  There's some funny moments here and there, but everything about the film is so bad (from the acting, the story, and the makeup effects) that you'll be in hysterics.  The tarman, the iconic zombie from the classic 1985 original, makes an appearance too, but it's far too brief to warrant any merit in watching this drek 
 I was recommended Borges' works by one of his innumerable over-educated sycophants and I will never forget the tremendous time I wasted attempting to grasp the supposed value of his life's work (when I should have been writing my dissertation). Each time I read one of his pedantic, mediocre peices of short fiction, I was convinced by these elite book review troglodytes that I would like other examples of his work if I continued reading since "all of his stories are so unique." I found the exact opposite to be true. One story after another about mazes, mirrors, mystical mathematical formulas and books, books, books. The ideas were transperant, the language boring in the extreme. His poetry is trite. Who needs this? Borges reads like a petulant graduate student at University of Chicago who failed repeatedly to get his/her short fiction published in _The Atlantic Monthly_. Particularly among academics, literary elites and like people, many seem to cite Borges and worship his genius more than read him--and certaintly _no one_ reads him critically. I read most of his work, and I can tell you, outside of a few interesting turns of phrase, you'd be better off reading a Yale dissertation on the semiotics of self-superiority. People incessantly talk about how imaginative Borges is. The vast majority of popular SF and fantasy writers are more imaginative. Even many of the despicable magical realist "geniuses" make Borges look rather plain. Borges merely litters his works with elite literary references and a kind of faculty cocktail party wit to make it more palatable to the kind of people who never step foot out of Manhattan or Cambridge. If you're this kind of pompous fellow, you'll want to sleep every night with a portrait of Luis by your side and a series of mirrors, as it were, slowly attempting to seek some kind of trans-substantiation with this benighted old librarian. If you're the kind of person who prefers reading about interesting characters, enjoying nuanced use of language, and grasping subtle, daring ideas that transcend purile academic banter, run far, far away from Jorge Luis Borges. Even top authors from all over the world and every historical period get bad reviews. The adulation of Borges merely underlines the fact that this is more about a cult of personality among (those who think themselves) intellectual elites than a serious attempt to evaluate his fiction. I think his fiction is better considered a kind of academic experiment, relegated to quirky local fiction publications and coffee house poetry slams, and not an example of literary genius. In that sense, 30min spent on one of his short stories gets you the drift of his entire body of work, and that's about as much attention as he deserves 
 If you are interested in reading a bunch of ignorant, bigoted stereo types, by all means buy this book. Robert Tallant was not a writer to bother with facts when spewing his hatred and racism. His depictions of New Orleans Voodoo and it's practitioners are dead wrong. If you want to read about New Orleans Voodoo, try Voodoo Queen: The Spirited Lives of Marie Laveau by Martha Ward. 
    I love the way Penelope Stokes can tell a story.  "The Amethyst Heart" is my favorite book by this author.  I suppose the reason I liked it is because Amethyst is always truthful, never wishy-washy, and has her priorities straight with regard to her relationship with God.    The characters in "Circle of Grace" are disappointing to say the least.  True friendship has to be based on truth, and truth is lacking in this book even when they all confessed their deceptions.  In my opinion, there is too much "pussy-footing" around and too much "political correctness" in their relationship. That's not the way people who love each other react in a crisis. I wanted one of them to stand up for their beliefs or at least grieve privately for Liz.  I wanted Tess to come out of the "closet" and say that she was a Christian because she loved Jesus, not because of some feminist agenda. I did not want Grace to have to apologize for being concerned about Amanda and her relationship with Bo. And at the end of the story, Bo's sudden and immediate transformation is not convincing.    I think the problem with this book is that it is about an issue: tolerance, which the author equates with grace.  The two are not the same.     I was going to donate this book to the church library, but somehow I feel the author failed to create characters that have a real relationship with God. Some of them go to church and even do good deeds. I was hoping one of them would be able to lead the others to Christ, but none of them had the courage to do it.      Also, the God in this book is not a real person. God, the loving father, the God of justice and compassion, as depicted in the scriptures is absent from this book.  In his place is some abstract power source.  I asked some of my Christian friends to read this book and they felt the same way 
 This is trash. Badly written, melodramatic, utterly silly. My copy is already in the recycle (not: re-use) bin. 
 I was thrilled when I first read that MLB Productions was finally issuing a DVD version of highlights of the Baltimore Orioles' three World Series victories.  I already owned the VHS versions, one of which (the 1970 World Series) had a major flaw in the audio synchronization (watching the last third of the highlights was like viewing a badly dubbed foreign film).  Finally, I could own all three highlights reels on one disc and without the sync error on the 1970 World Series. Much to my dismay, the MLB logo is permanently, and obtrusively, displayed on the upper right corner of all three programs.  What's that all about?  Does MLB Productions think I'm going to illegally copy and distribute stills?  Thank goodness I don't own a plasma TV or I'd be staring at that stupid logo for the next five years! Sound and picture quality are okay otherwise.  But....that logo is really annoying 
 Well, I just purchased this book and I have to say I'm pretty disappointed.  I own many of the books already compared in reviews here, and have climbed for years, and I feel that the other books are much better.  Here's why....  First, some of his choices are pretty odd, and are presented as 'the only way':  - Advocating the use of a backup sling sewn onto a 4000lb-test rap ring (if you're that worried, why not just use two rings - it's lighter, simpler, and won't tangle your anchor!)  - Spending four pages on avalanche discussion, but only one sentence on avalanche transceivers, and then only to call them 'corpse locators'   - Talking about the flipping problems of the figure-8 when used to join two ropes  (he calls it 'ring-loading') and advises the use of the overhand (EDK) instead... but neglects to mention that the overhand can also flip.  And then, some of his photos are just plain hazardous (!):  - Transferring an entire belay to hang off only a skinny klemheist cord on page 316  - A subtle triaxial loading of a carabiner on a tree on page 142 (the force on the spine is inward, not outward)  - Not backing up any of his Munter-Mule combinations (they don't call the Mule knot a load-releasable-slip-knot for nuthin') on pages 315-317  And the above points were just from a day of reading and skimming...I'm sure the list goes on.    Sure, he's got some great stuff apart from all this.  He includes a lot of numbers (everything from gear strength to giardia concentration) which I like.  The nutrition chapter is quite nice, as is his chapter on anchor physics.  Plus, I feel that the book is definitely more 'modern' than Mountaineering Freedom of the Hills, and cuts out a lot of items most mountaineers don't care about (aid climbing, dual-line rock rescue, etc).  But, being advertised as a 'handbook', I feel that this book (a) is too biased and (b) has enough subtle errors to make me say that other books are a more suitable basis for beginners.  In short, I'd recommend spending the extra bit of $$ and getting both MFOTH and Alpine Climbing, and using Alpine Climbing to learn 'modern' climbing, and using MFOTH for the basics.  Just my two cents.  Rock on 
 but this still would not make up for the disarray this book is in.  The author has a lot of interesting information, but "Tomorrow's Energy" (TE) is very poorly compiled and editted, making it very difficult to read or skim through. I have another book I would recommend in place of this one, but I will hold off until the end of this review because TE should be fully addressed.  There is almost no foresight in this book. TE reads almost like hydrogen is just a fuel of the past when in fact many of us hope and expect it will one day be our fuel of choice. Even in the last chapter, "The Next 100 Years," the author just continues quoting away and giving speculation by others instead of reflecting on where hydrogen is going to go from his expertise (his perspective would have been nice since he has obviously done a lot of research on the topic).  The book reads like a collection of essays by the author on historical bits about hydrogen. Instead of telling us who did what on what date and here is what the person who did it had to say, it would have been far more useful to have the author explain in his own words what is going on and break the book into smaller sections if necessary (which really is necessary since there are so many random discussions it is painful).  Also, as "Slezak" mentioned, the units (GJ, BTU's, calories, you name it, it's in here) are flip-flopped throughout the book, making it incredibly difficult to follow the numbers, which is really relavent information to this topic.  The only type of person who will find TE useful over the book below is someone who wants to know a lot of details about the history of hydrogen and less about whether it will be useful for us in the future.  Now, my recommendation...  "The Hype about Hydrogen" (THAH), by Joseph Romm  THAH is still a little dry, but it does magnitudes better than TE, and it is consistent with units and has pretty clear descriptions. I couldn't put THAH down (I finished it in less than 2 days*), but after getting into TE about 100 pages, I dreaded going back to it. I made myself finish TE because I looked forward to what I expected to be the forward thinking last chapter (which, as mentioned above, was a great disappointment). *I'm a diligent (slow) reader 
 While easy enough to read, if the exact same pages were enclosed in a Harlequin Romance cover, I wouldn't know the difference.  I'm extremely surprised this is a "best seller". Maybe I should take up writing because I can't possibly be worse than this.  Ok, it's a good enough story but wow, it's predictible and boring. I read it completely in 2 days, and I'm a reader that savors pages so it takes me a while. I wasn't intrigued, I wasn't on the edge of my seat, and didn't shed a tear 
 My mistake, I should have read the customer reviews before I spent $6.95 on this silly little book.  I was so irritated upon opening my box from Amazon but I realized it was my fault for not scrolling down to see what other said about it.  It takes about two minutes to read and even though the advice is good it isn't worth the money at all. 
 I really made a mistake and bought 2 sets, thinking I could always have extras ready.  I tried all types of grinds, I packed loosely, I packed firmly, I packed tight, I played and played. Still did not get a good cup of coffee.  Finally, threw them out.  Just taking up space.  Learned a lesson on buying quantity 
 If you're impressed with books by ageing wannabees desperately seeking reassurance through the challenging medium of bored, penniless prostitutes, you'll find this riveting. Otherwise you'll probably find it to be indulgent garbage.  I first went to Cuba in 1995 (being from Europe it was not a problem to travel there), around the time the Buena Vista Social Club was gaining worldwide recognition. It was a fascinating place. I stopped going about five years ago, as the place was becoming oppressive, full of miserable sex tourists and those same bored, penniless prostitutes who practically throw themselves at any foreigner who has a few dollars to offer (the average monthly wage in Cuba is about $10). It is also becoming more dangerous, due in part to the growing desperation and in part to the increase in drug activity. Inevitably, AIDS is becoming more widespread.  Baker seems at home amidst the seedier side of modern day Cuba. A quick look at the website makes it easier to understand why that might be. His gullibility, so apparent in the book, is perhaps less easy to comprehend. Don Juan, he clearly ain't. But he is supposed to be well traveled.  If what you are really interested in is a well-researched book on Cuba, believe me, there are much better ones than this. Don't be conned 
 Before purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews.  The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead.  As it turns out I made the best decision.  All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers'; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price.  My statement has nothing to do with the author's writing skills, he is a skilled writer.  It has everything to do with his lack of insight.  That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.  I read the book, waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.  But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.  Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Paul's life hard.  Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.  He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.    If you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.  If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.  As I read this book I felt sadness, a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.  (There are white folks who actually still think like this.)  My hope is that the light comes on for Paul, he is still young.  If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.   
 Just rented this dvd and was quite surprised.  Normally, I'm a big George Clooney and Matt Damon fan.  However, in this film, their talents were underutilized and did not make up for the poor script, editing, and direction which made this film quite dull to watch.  While the idea behind the movie is good, it could have been more entertaing, dramatic, or suspensful.  As another reviewer remarked, I was quite tempted to shut it off after 45 minutes and watch something else.  But, I did suffer through to the end, where the film just sort of ends and leaves viewers hanging.. 
 I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it.  After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw.  After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book.  It found it's way to the trash can.  Don't waste your time on this 
 I bought this book when I was attending a Pentecostal church that was very unbalanced and unscriptural about their view of and use of tongues (way overboard actually). It was no help. It is very rare for me to not finish a book, but this is one I did not finish. The author's tone was very self important. The first part of the book was more about finger pointing at misguided people, like a traveling preacher whose wife mingled with the crowd and radiod information to his ear piece so he could look spirit filled. This information is worthless for someone trying to find out more about spiritual gifts, especially tongues. Far better would be to get a concordance and just study the Bible yourself than to wade through this blah book looking for the missing insight 
 received above book; correct cover, but inside is another book by name of 'the glass key' by dashiell hammett. tried to contact you by various means, to no avail.original packaging long gone. how do i go about getting the book i ordered?? 
 This book had lots of potential.  Unfortunately the author could not get past his training to use language and an approach which is more accessible and more concise.  Example:  "It may be significant that Geb and Nut are separated by Shu, for X and Y ultimately separate into a discrepant state because of the deviation-amplifying tendency of the 'Shu-Tefnut' reaction loop.  The author is attempting to correlate recent findings in physics with classical mystical systems from Egypt, and with Astrology, and the Tarot.  But the writing style is methodical and cold and unnecessarily wordy and redundant.  It is encouraging that science is attempting to make connections back to reality expressed in mythology.  However science is lost in that it continues to attempt to make the reconnection using on the brain and missing the activity of the heart and body.  What is largely unforgivable is that the author is stumbling around  primary concepts of his thesis without clearly stating it.  The largest blarring omission is an emphasis on archetypes.  There are indeed archetypal connections between physics and myth but the author has failed to inspire insights and remains brain-bound to his training and equations.  If you are looking for deeper insights between science and Egypt then 'Serpent in the Sky' by John Anthony West remains one of the best books on the subject.  'Temple of the Cosmos' by Jeremy Naydler is also a good book on Egyptian mythology. 
 If your looking for something beyond gradeschool math (read:algebra/geometry)then I wouldn't recommend this book. The formulas would be usefull in modifying from an already set or measured value (tire size,mph,mpg) but would not be usefull when trying to design, analyze or mathmaticaly model anything. Use of English units nice for laymen.  I was dissapointed at the lack of truely usefull equations, most seem to be shuffling of equations.  Conversion tables are nice however 
 Danielle Steel stories are always so fairy tale type, macho prince on a white horse, weepy needy naive princess in a pink dress and all. If something is bad it is all bad, if it is good it is all good. Nothing in between. Everything falls into place. A character would start as a very busy boss of a very profitting business, very tough boss with no escape, and he would turn out to be a too-caring babysitter with nothing to do at all if the storyline needs it. Only Americans can take so much juvenile crap because they choose to live in a fantasy world and this lady writer is just feeding them with it. From my experience female writers happen to have a weak capability in depicting male characters, they get so anxious to cover up this inability that they tend to make all the male characters from their dreams with a little touch from their real life. As a result the male characters are all depicted as phony, hard-to-believe type. The way of storytelling is so shallow, even a 12-year-old will laugh at it 
 Suppose you updated Dante's "Inferno" into the modern setting putting in people we hate in our modern day and making the text more coherent to Mr. Average Joe on the street. It would be a unique, interesting project, and one they attempted here - but this rendition of Dante's masterpiece walks the thin line between modern and just flat-out unintentionally laughable.  In many ways it could be done well. There are people who write books on street life who are profane and vulgar - yet somehow, they come at you with a class all their own. Birk, unfortunately, can't do that. His take on the Dante's prose into modern life can be done in a very simple formula: 1) add swear words at the beginning of your sentence, and 2) occasionally replace Dante's original metaphors with phrases like "a bag of cheetos." Many of the metaphors don't make any sense - the most glaring example coming from one that compares two demons fighting to fighter jets clawing at each other. OK people, let's be serious here - how many of you have seen fighter jets "claw" at each other?  The update of Hell doesn't fit too well with location, either. Dante's originally version of Hell was several layers, each going deeper and deeper until finally at the very bottom pits of damnation you came face to face with Satan himself. Birk instead chooses random city locations for his "levels," with no real clear path like the original one Dante described to us. And it could have done so well, too - just imagine starting out perhaps at the start of a skyscraper, working your way down to the city, stopping at shops, reaching the boondocks, then entering the subway, and eventually down the sewers and below. Satan's place in the story and in Sandow Birk's sketching is along a highway. Nothing too spectacular about that really, compared to the very core of Hell that Dante originally gave us. As I pointed out, this was a wonderful opportunity to use the different levels of a city to go with the levels of Hell, but everything stays on two or three levels.  The best reason - in fact, the ONLY reason - to purchase this is for Sandow Birk's sketchings. They were wonderfully done and fit the idea of a modern Dante better than he could do in words. But you don't have to buy the book just to see them - in fact, I wouldn't suggest buying the book 
 What an abyss exists between the potency of the Book of the Law and Crowley's cheap shot commentaries, welcome to the Tawdry New Age. But this is perhaps the best pointer to the profundity of the original, even Crowley  seems to have finally understood the stink of all this, and thus the short  comment, but it takes years to really understand, pearls before swine, and  this case of poo before swin 
 Rachel and Darcy. Best friends since grade school. Rachel is the average-looking one with good grades; Darcy is the good-looking one with average grades. Rachel has worked hard all her life and is a lawyer at a NY law firm (a very unhappy, overworked lawyer...). Darcy learned early on in life that thanks to her great looks, she doesn't have to work as hard to get what she wants. Therefore she has become a bit shallow and still has a lot of growing up to do. On Rachel's 30th birthday, Darcy throws her a party and Rachel gets drunk and sleeps with Darcy's handsome fiancï¿½, Dex. After sleeping together, Rachel and Dex realize they have loved each other all these 7 years . . .  now they are torn. Can they pursue their love and risk loosing Darcy?  I found this book fun to read in the beginning. Giffin is a vivid writer and I chuckled out loud because I could relate to many of the flashbacks of Rachel and Darcy growing up in the Midwest. But as the book progressed I started to loose respect for Rachel. Not only because she was completely betraying her best friend, but also because she lacked character and self esteem. In all aspects of her life (with Darcy, at her job and even with Dex) she was extremely insecure and meek. She lets others dominate her and is unable to stand up for herself. Even though I disagreed with her sleeping with her best friends fiancï¿½ I kept wondering why she wouldn't just tell Dex to leave Darcy and be with her (after all Dex kept telling her how much he loved her). I realize not everyone can have great self esteem and be secure in every aspect of his or her life but sleeping with your best friends fiancï¿½ is a very slimy way of gaining confidence.  I also think Giffin could have done a better job developing Dexter. His character lacked charisma and appeal. He is a lawyer and he's hot. OK. So what else made him so great that Rachel was willing to loose her life-long best friend for?   I read the sequel "Something Blue" to see what happens to Darcy and I liked that one better!!!! I also HIGHLY recommend Giffin's third and best book "Baby Proof" (that one is not about Rachel or Darcy!).     ***spoiler ahead**** My biggest gripe is that the author took the easy way out in the end with what happens with Darcy and Marcus. It was a cheap cop-out way to make Darcy the villain so you excuse Rachel and Dex's deceit.  Didn't work with me! Two wrongs don't make a right.            
 As a Sylvia Browne fan, I was terribly disappointed in this audio tape.  90% of it is a bunch of mumbo jumbo guided visualization/ meditation help that anyone could think up with a minimum amount of effort or skill.  Stick to the Audio tape Angels and Spirit Guides.   Sorry Sylvia 
 It was slightly interesting, but I found myself skipping around in the book to see if it gets any better 
 I read this book with great interest a few years ago.  Now I have learned that there is lots of controversy over it.  It seems that one of the scientists who was behind lots of the ideas in this book was a creationist who kept that fact quiet.  There is another book "Life Everywhere" by David Darling, that answers many of the arguments in "Rare Earth"  To get both sides of the story, do a google search on: "rare earth" "intelligent design" creationism You might also add the name "Guillermo Gonzalez" to your search.  He is the scientist/creationist who I mentioned earlier 
 The book's whole concentration is on subjugating females to males.  It's about all the things females are to do to serve the male sex, particularly the husband.  There is almost nothing about what men or husbands are supposed to do for their wives.  If the material in this book is correct, why would any woman want to get married?  The way husband wife relationships are described in this book is that the relation exists for the benefit of the husband, not the wife.  A woman would be better off single than being in the type of marriage relationship this book describes.  If the material in this book is correct why would any woman want to attend church?  Her only function would be as a servant to lift up the male leaders of the church.  She would be better off spending her time elsewhere where she is permitted to use all her gifts.  This book is the best argument I know for why women should not marry or go to church.    
 As you probably have read by now, this album is a compilation of material previously released as B-sides - and it probably should have stayed that way. Although this album is better than the absurdly awful "Be Here Now" - it is not as terribly bad and annoying as that album - there are real no standout tracks on this album. "Acquiesce," the first track is decent, but other tracks are average, don't stick out and don't stay in your memory long, or are just bad. I borrowed this CD from the library for 3 weeks and gave it several listens. That is usually enough time for me to judge an album enough for me to know whether it's worth buying, and this one just isn't. [...]  Oasis must have spent all their creative energy on Definitely Maybe and (What's the Story) Morning Glory because they have not made an album that is even half-decent since then.  I have wasted a lot of time borrowing CD's released since their two breakthrough albums wondering "hmm... what ever happened to Oasis anyway?" to see if they released any decent material since their glory days.  The answer is NO and I do not recommend listening to any albums after their first two.  I did the same thing with Collective Soul's later albums, a group that has continued to release good material even after their glory days in the mid-90s, but not Oasis.  Must be the coke 
 Hard to put into words what makes this book so bad.  Deadening prose style, characters from central casting, reliance on pure absorptive technique despite the prearranged result.  Shields is also way too concerned about whether or not his readers understand bike racing and French.  Oh, and you'll find yourself desparate to get back to present from the flashback passages.  Allow me to summarize them in one sentence.  Utah is pretty and full of backcountry yeoman-farmer fun, except for our hero's sulky father 
 Very dissappointed with the product. It showed up in several pieces when I open the box. The sleeve is all torn up and falling apart. 2 bottom corners of the books is all smashed up. Not sure who's to blame - the packaging guy or the delivery man. Informed customer service about getting a replacement - unsuccesful - all I got is a freaking $10 credit on me next purchases. After this disaster, not sure if there is a next purchase 
 I tried to play this movie in my DVD player and it wouldn't work.  After reading the reviews here I discovered that new Sony movies won't play on half the players in the US.  I am done buying Sony movies until this is fixed.  This is like the time they installed the virus on peoples computers when they bought a CD.  Hopefully, some lawyer can fix this.  I'll just have to buy movies somewhere else for now 
 I have been reading this book out loud to my BF, who now worships Dr. Gray as it should be titled, "Why women should give men sex all the time".   Dr. Gray actually lists why we should give our man a quickie when we really don't want to, don't have time or are tired. He even says we should give a hand job when we have a bad headache!!! Men, if your woman has a headache, run her a warm bubble bath, light some candles, give her a massage and you'll increase your chances of getting some!   He also states that at certain times of the month many women don't feel the need to have an orgasm. I know LOTS of women and none of them will tell you orgasms are not important! Yes, sometime I will give my man a quickie and not worry about my orgasm, but that is totally up to me, NOT DR. GRAY.  He also states it's ok to look at other women in front of us as long as our men tell us they love us. Gee, not enough beautiful women on TV, billboards and magazines to look at when we're not around? I don't drool over other men when my man is around because I RESPECT him. If more couples respected each other they would have less trouble.  He has some good tips like men need to spend more time on foreplay, complimenting your woman, but I am on page 88 out of 206 and it has been overwhelmingly biased toward giving men what they want all the time and apparently at all costs 
 LOOK, ANYTIME AN AUTHOR TEAMS UP WITH ANOTHER ONE ( whom i don't know ) TO WRITE A BOOK THAT SHOULD BE YOUR FIRST WARNING . MY EXCUSE THEN ?  WELL, I WAS IN A HOTEL ON VACATION, COULDN'T SLEEP ...AND THIS  PULP FICTION WAS THE LESSER OF THE EVILS IN THE GIFTY-GIFT SHOP WHERE I PAID FULL PRICE.  I SUSPECT I MAY EVEN HAD PAID CANADIAN PRICES EVEN THO I WAS IN WASHINGTON D.C.   LOL...THE JOKE IS ON ME .  BUT, PER USUAL I SHALL DONATE THIS  HARDLY BENT BOOK TO EITHER MY LIBRRAY,  OR IF THEY REFUSE TO TOUCH IT ...A PRISON WHERE THEY CAN'T COMPLAIN. I GAVE IT TWO STARS FOR CORRECT SPELLING ....LOL.  I SHOULD HAVE STUCK WITH INSOMNIA  
 This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand, Fielding's Tom Jones is a delight and mustn't be missed at any cost! This book is a total waste, though!  
 People like bunker2k1 sicken me, talking about peace and then turning around and saying how much he enjoys Burning books. The fact is that the Acult is no different then most other religions. Christianity its self is the largest Acult. So before you start preaching about peace and Jesus Why don't you look into the history of Christianity. You will then see the Purest of all evil. Wonder why its the most excepted religion? Lets see because The Christian faith was a plague across the land killing entire villages of people and converting all it can. You where told to drop your faith and except Christ. This is the reason today it is where it is. Not because of love or peace but with murder,hate and the idea of having everyone believe in the same thing. If you look at history where do you see devil worshippers or witches even killing 1% of the people that Christians, catholics do. they don't, its a fear tactic to make people believe their is a "DEVIL" Around every corner to keep people believing in the lie. So you can Pray to your GOD of false LOVE believing their is a devil and the acult is out their waiting to take you and your children, Or you can open your eyes do some research and you will find out Christian based religions are the Acult you place so much fear into 
 This is overall a real hoot! Anthony Hopkins is superb! "Fats" the dummy steals lots of the scenes.  The question that crosses my mind is which is more frightening the Dummy or Ann Margarett trying to act!  Burgess Meredith is great as the manager. One point of interest is the horrible score by Jerry Goldsmith.  He throws in a great harmonica riff when we see "Fats", but during some of the more "romantic " scenes the music is so cloying it would make Yanni blush.  Don,t miss the extras where they talk with the real "vent" that worked with them on the movie.   If you like movies that are a bit "outside" this is a must have for any collection.  Pete Cavan 
 OK, people, here's some advice before you think about buying this book. Don't just look at all the 4 and 5 star customer reviews - rank the customer review list from Lowest Rank First and read all the 1 star reviews as well. That way you can REALLY get a broader sense of what you might be getting yourself into. Sure, in both the high reviews and the low reviews there's just basic no-brainer reviews - "it's great!!" or "its sucks!!" But amongst all the one star reviews I discovered some smart punters whom i SHOULD have read before buying the damn book myself. Yup, i bought this monstrous piece of rubbish and after going back and reading all the low reviews I realise that some reviewers had duly warned me. This book is TERRIBLE. It gives only the scantiest of basics on body language, stereotypical stuff which any schmuck with less than half a brain could write. And the photos - MY GOD! Its Mr Steele with his wife and their friends, posing away in their garish shirts and shorts...these are some of the ugliest photos to be used for "flirting" and "body language" I've ever ever seen. And in his blurb photo at the front of the book he's standing there shirtless revealing his copiously hairy chest - there's something about seeing the author of a book posing like this that I find highly disturbing. Yucko. As others have said, if i could give this book a zero star rating, I would. Avoid, everyone, avoid like the plague. 
 This book really fell flat.  Lynne Hinton's first book Friendship Cake what such a good read.  I was sincerely disappointed in her second work.  She had a good beginning, but after you read awhile the characters begin to become redundant, and a little dull.  There was some hope of a good plot, but something was definitly missing.  Try again Lynne, you have talent.  Maybe try a sequel to Friendship Cake.  The characters that you developed in that book are really good 
 I am a student of third reich history and when I heard of the release of this film I managed to see it at an independent theatre.  While there is a great deal of interesting documentary footage and fair analysis this has got to be about the dullest documentary I have ever seen.  There is no style to the directing or editing.  The narration is even worse.  The good points are negated by the overall stale production.  This is certainly not a film to even rent let alone purchase.  (Unless you are an insomiac. 
 I admit that I am not qualified to "judge" FW. Not because I am stupid, as many 5-star reviewers would assert, I think. I would consider giving up on THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO "stupid." I cannot judge FW as literature because literature is meant to be read, and comprehended. It is not complexity, depth, or any of the like that make this book incomprehensible to me. It is written in its own language. It is its own realm. To judge it would be like judging the writing of an alien civilization. And that is why I gave FW 1 star: it is nonscoreable.  This book--FW--seems to be Joyce's joke, or private world, or both. I doubt that any one who claims to love this book has "got it" in the sense that Joyce meant it to be understood, either. If one has the perserverance, one will find one's own meaning/pattern in FW, if only because it is human nature to impose order on chaos and...gibberish.   FW is certainly fascinating for its complexity of word games. As for the poetic quality of the words? I couldn't speak for that. When a word is over 20 characters long, a mishmash of randomness, I generally stumble like an idiot over every syllable. Thus: it was not fluid. It was not poetic.  Yet, for all of its puzzle-like quality, I could not call FW great literature. This is unreadable. Even if one knew all of the languages Joyce was acquainted with, it would still be, I think, unreadable. Joyce was the only one who understood it, and he is dead. I agree, the many interpretations FW has spawned are impressive; but also quite pathetic, if one considers how many scholars spent their lives trying to decipher this.  If there is any definite meaning here--any statement Joyce was trying to make--then he failed in conveying it.   I'd recommend that anyone who still has any doubts look up FINNEGANS WAKE online--one can find a free online copy. If still your ego insists on reading this, then purchase as many supplementary books as possible, and good luck 
 It's heart might be in the right place, but this tepid misfire looks like a bad TV schools production in every way. The 'exteriors' are obviously interior studio sets, and not very convincing ones. It's so badly lit that when the film finally goes outdoors to rip off the end of Gallipoli (which it does incredibly badly, like everything else) the change of film stock is so jarring it hurts.  The characters are childish stereotypes talking in unbelievable clichés and the film is frequently just plain wrong about details and attitudes of the average WW1 Tommy: politically correct, maybe, but historically it's a travesty (no Mr Boyd, officers DID go over the top: the highest percentage of casualties was officers, and even many generals died in battle).  But more than being badly directed, looking cheap, getting its facts wrong and going with every cliché Boyd can find, it's biggest sin is that it's just so bloody boring. Bad on every level.  WW1 was a terrible tragedy, and those who died in it deserve better than this terrible, terrible film. 
 I read all 33 of the other reviews here to get other perspectives - a lively debate.  There were so many brilliant things said about the film, that I found myself passing out "Helpful" votes (to both positive & blisteringly negative reviews) like they were candy.  The movie is an evocative work of art.  I encourage people to read all the reviews if they want to enjoy the movie from many different points of view.  I agree with many of the positive and negative comments that have been made by other reviewers, but I will limit my comments to items not previously mentioned.  The DVD cover gives the false impression that this is a love story about two young lovers, a sort of "Blue Lagoon" from the Renaissance.  It is not.  It is misleading.  I concede a) the story is probably not historically accurate, b) statutory rape occurred and probably rape under any definition, & c) Tossi was probably inconsiderate, conceited, and immoral.  But the quality of a film is not judged solely on historical accuracy and the high morality of the characters.  Having said that, I do object that the movie, according to the rape trial transcript and some of the best evidence available, is not just inaccurate, but oppositional to what probably occurred.  Therefore, I critique the film for portraying itself as the story of a real person.  The movie stumbles internally because it tries to justify actual historical effects with fictional (or incorrect) causal factors.  And those cause-effect relationships don't seem to ring true.  Having said that, I agree with some of Richard Burt's review comments that "historical accuracy" may still be subject to interpretation.  It is reasonable that Artemisia may have been more adversarial speaking in a public rape trial (defending her freedom and reputation) than she might have been with Tassi personally.  And it seems too easy to just paint Tassi as a purely evil character as other reviewers have done.  There is usually more complexity and diverse/conflicting interests in most people, especially artists.  One strong objection - near the end of the film, Artemisia says, "No one dies of sorrow."  While there is probably some intended sarcasm in the comment, the line frustrated me.  People DO die of sorrow.  My limited experience has suggested that some of the smartest, most sensitive, artistic, and caring people I've encountered were the same people most threatened by sorrow.  And the people I have admired the most are the same people who have been mortally threatened by sorrow.  Not selfish, controlling, or passive-aggressive sorrow, but rather sorrow that comes from other less obvious motivations - often unidentified & misunderstood misconceptions.  Sorrow can lead to literal death and deaths of the spirit, character, the soul, & creativity.  Sorrow is not incidental.  Sorrow can destroy health.  Or as the Angel of America in "Angels in America" says, "The body is the garden of the soul."  Sorrow is worth full attention.  The movie tries to examine the effect of Artemisia's loyalties to her father and her teacher.  The screenwriter is not bent on us assessing those relationships as simply "good" or "bad"; both relationships are drawn as having both good or bad effects on Artemesia.  Her loyalties encourage her artistry and her expression.  They work to create an environment that does not inhibit or conceal her gifts.  At the same time, they are so intrusive that they almost certainly affect her choices, privacy, and pacing beyond her desired level of influence.  Artemisia realizes she would probably not be the painter she becomes except for her father's drive and design.  At the same time, she also laments that his constant intervention narrowed the occupations she could participate in - in polite society.  May your loyalties encourage seeking and speaking the best personal truths you can find.  And may the best personal truths you can find shape your loyalties.  Compare Caravaggio's "Judith Beheading Holofernes" to Artemisia's version of the same painting.  Her version is more violent, realistic (less idealized in posing, dirtiness, lighting, etc.).  Her version has the female servant actively helping Judith.  Artemisia's paintings show a palpable understanding of hate, violence, sexuality & compassion.  Artemisia likely became expressive of the personal feelings and experiences she knew best.  That's why people care about whether a movie about her life characterizes her experiences accurately - because we want to know what led her to her creative decisions 
 George Bush. Yes, obviously the Best Prez ever. Asl NOLA residents.  Pirro, ah yes. One of the brightest. Look for her look for her speech for an eternity announcing her bid to unseat Hilary.   Thompson, who appeared in Pro Iraq War ads before it was launched.    Those are 3 geniuses featured in this moron's book.   I do love Dolly Parton, though. I am sure she's shivering at being in the same tome as these losers, written by a vapid neoconservative whore. 
 This is an abyssally written, horribly researched, inaccurate, unorganized babble of idle gossip about some truly great artists and writers. The author should not attempt to write about things beyond his limited ken.  What a travesty that a publisher would agree to print such garbage 
 Reissued in August 2006, the novel is part of the Dirk Pitt series; an ongoing character from Clive Cussler.  The action surrounds a U.S. aircraft, Vixen 03, that crashes in a Colorado lake in 1954. It contained 36 quick-death germ bombs, but two are missing when Pitt and his pals find the sunken plane some 30 years later.  The missing canisters are in the hands of some bad guys whose mission is to sail a battleship up the Potomic River and unleash the bombs on Washington. D.C.  The premise is a bit silly and the writing is highly dated (the novel was initially published in the 1970s). Pitt seemingly has super-hero qualities - without having to dress in a phone-booth - and his pals always seem to arrive just in the nick of time to grab victory out of the clutches of defeat. I was waiting for "zowie," "pow," and "bam" to roll from the pages as the good guys battle those pesky evil-doers!  The novel sets up well to the point of the discovery of the aircraft and Pitt piecing together the mystery surrounding the crash. After that, it becomes a tepid battle against time, with a sophomoric ending worthy of a creative writing class, circa 7th Grade.       
 what a ripoff. the "miniature version" is stashed in the details, not placed in the title. the reviews are for the full version. and now i feel like "amazon shopping for dummies". i have absolutely no use for a 2"x2" book on anything 
 I tend to like books like this. Sadly, not this one. As a 30 year Chicago Police veteran, with my last assignment in the Detective Division I picked this up to read when I noticed that it took place in a district I had worked at one time. The main character is somewhat real, kind of hard-edged, like an officer with a few years on the job.  I was ready to forgive the author stretching the boundries of the 23rd District way up to the 24th, past the 20th. I could also forgive, for the sake of the story, that her 'boss', a sergeant,(not a lieutenant, or captain as in real life) would call her in on her day off. Not likely, certainly given that she would have to be paid at a great overtime rate. I could even forgive that she would walk into the men's locker room to ask who she was working with. (not likely in any district, and certainly not 23). I might even forgive that her boss, or any of the officers would make her work with her 'ex' for a tour.  BUT, when she gets into a shooting where her partner is shot, and she doesn't (or he as it first starts when he is still alive) call in 'shots fired' a 10-1, or as the title suggests "officer down" then things begin to go south real fast. To begin with, they had requested back-up at this location before going in. For the deparment to suspect that this was a bad incident and not to take her word from the start and begin to look for the named suspect is dumb.  In any shooting such as this, on-duty, the benefit of the doubt would go to officer, and all effort would be made to find the offender. Certainly the word of another of the beat cops that he couldn't find any sign of someone being there would not be given any value. And, if this were indeed an empty building in that area, it would be loaded with signs of occupants, previous or squaters.  IF it was to be determined after investigation that he had been shot by her rather than the bad guy, only then would steps be taken to suspend her.  Sadly, most of the police story doesn't ring true at all.  Lastly, while the author seems to know locations, it's too bad that for all her knowledge of the city, she didn't know that we don't have "DAs" in Chicago, or Illinois. It is an "SA" or States Attorney. And the police deal with "ASAs" for investigations.  As another reviewer mentioned, this is just the same old story about the female officer blamed for something that she hadn't done by the bad old police deparment forced to prove herself. Skip the effort for this one and read a better one.   
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. It was not what I expected and I was bored 95% of the time 
 My excitement to learn Haskell faded with every page turned. The Author presented the subject with such excitement comparable only to that of watching paint dry 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 This film is just like the The Sixth Sense film.  Both films have the same borring plot.  THE BORRING PLOT. In the two movies they have 2 boys who can see and speak to ghosts and in the 2 movies there are 2 teenagers girls who are ghosts who want help and showing the boy and man the people who had kill them.  After the boy and the man shows and tells other people who has killed the 2 teenagers, the two teenager girls ghosts are happy and they are at pease at last.   The Sixth Sense and this film is deserve to be seen only one time and after that you dont want to see again.  If you are like me and love ghosts who are bad and evil and kills people, you will love 13 Ghosts.  That film is what I called a good ghost film 
 Mr. Goldberg obviously worked and worked at this book. It is chock full of information, some of it now dated. But mainly, one can see the seams, the labor in the writing, which makes for labored reading. Not recommended 
 Just another typical manipulative book by a so-called christian psychologist giving her own personal 'bible interpretation' of what marriage should be, using all the usual 'techniques' and lacking knowledge of what marriage is really all about. Despite the emphasis and talk about "submission", what you will really find is how to deceptively use "power" to get what you want 
 I'm dog-obsessed and was looking for a cool dog calendar for 2007... I love M.E. but I could not find a good description - or preview of what was actually in this calendar. I think the title is misleading in that A Year with ME - could mean a year with MARY ENGELBRIET -- not "me". And You Lucky Dog! - like she's holding on the cover might mean the calendar is filled with adorable lucky dogs. It's not. It's cute, but not what I was looking for.. the search continues - can't find a cute illustrated DOG calendar 
 I have been reading Jodi Picoult's books since I first came across The Pact at the library.  And from there I glommed most of her books reading back to her previous titles such as Songs of the Humpback Whale and then her books, Keeping Faith, Salem Falls, Perfect Match and Plain Truth.  Unfortunately in recent years I haven't been able to get into some of her titles, specifically Vanishing Acts and My Sister's Keeper.  The latter title was just too sad for me to finish.  It was therefore with some trepidation that I picked up the CD of The Tenth Circle while at the library. Because I was told that there was a parallel story told in comice book form, I was concerned that I might be missing something although other readers said I wouldn't be missing much.  But at this point I must add that while the reader did a fine job and I was initially intrigued with the plot and characters, this book dissolved into a listening experience of a book which went off into too many directions to be a good reading experience for me.  I won't review the details of the plot or characters since so many others have done a fine job of this, rather offer, instead my  views just as I finished this title.  I just finished listening to The Tenth Circle and found it was such a grim book.  Not that Jodi Picoult's other books were rollicking fun but this one reminded me of a line from one of her books that said, "There ought to be a moratorium on grief."  Unbelievable the imagination some writers have.  Maybe that's why they're writers and I'm not.  But there were some unanswered questions, coincidence, sheer improbability and then she wrapped up the ending a bit too quickly.  And I might add a bit too happily or hopefully from all that happened for me to consider this a book I enjoyed.  But I do have to add that there was some wonderful writing about what it means to be a parent but I just found it overall very disappointing. I do hope I'm not spoiling this for anybody with such a negative review but I used to love this author's books and wonder if I'll continue to read her which makes me sad. 
 I have experienced exactly the same result like the comments of following persons: - The reader of September 30,1998.  - The reader "Ron Lininger" from Febuary 9,1999 and especially the reader from  Sunnyvale,CA,July 21,1998 
 This is the required text for my course. I've read it thoroughly and it seems great, but it definitely is not getting me the grade I want.  I'm buying a different textbook to supplement 
 I ordered this and The Favorite Game, taking advantage of Amazons buy two and get a deal policy. I didn't like this book at all. It doesn't feel as natural as Favorite Game, it doesn't flow like FG and doesn't delieve like FG.  I don't know what Mister Cohen was trying to accomplish... James Joyce or Henry Miller lost generation of Montreal? The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is solely on my adoration of the author 
 I used to love these bottles until the nipple collapsed twice while feeding my 4 month old daughter, causing almost the entire bottle to spill in her mouth and nose.  The first time it happened I thought I didn't screw the top on, but then it happened again.  After doing some research, this is a common problem with these bottles.  
 How good was this book????  I don't even remember the story line.  I know I read the book and past it along to a friend, but it sure wasn't memoriable.  Sorry folks, your not going to get a rave from me 
 No...the answer to the question above, is that these guys are a metal version of a boy band, generated to sell records and appeal to the angry and mis-guided youth of America. They provide no great contribution or originality to music at all. A couple monkey like sounds from the singer with a sort of rappish vocals and repetitive guitars is all this band has to offer. Really, what is so great about these guys? Their anger and angst? Their musical abilities(HA HA). I have heard all of their albums and I hate them all, they have no talent and they pretty much rode on the NU-Metal wave, which has long since crashed against the sandy shores of real music and receded back into the depths where crappy music with no skill or talent belongs. Each song sounds the same, follows the same formula and style. All of the songs practically blend together. At least on their sophomore release they tried some to incorporate some different things into their music, and failed miserably. And their latest album? It is just as horrid and un-original as everything else they have made.. 
 For a good price of approximate $4.50 (as I recall) plus shipping, I ordered the Bargaincell- Brand New Ikross Retractable car cigarette lighter adapter.   It did not work.   I suppose I could have packaged it up and sent it back (at a cost to me) and probably received a replacement. But for the cost of the unit, it was not worth my time. I've resorted to using a standard car recharger 
 You could write this book yourself - all  you have to do is spend a half hour thinking about all the different kinds of boundaries that exist between people. It's just a grocery list. Anne Katherine's only contribution is some anecdotes purportedly drawn from her clinical experience. The book cleverly leaves you with the impression that you've been given some advice, but the advice is missing.  Check it out 
 Like another reviewer, my DVD's were blank--except for the producer's ads.. I'd really like to see the workouts, but do I risk getting another set of blanks, too 
 This book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if James Frey did not repeat himself a million times. Although, the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive. This book however, did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox. He could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing -up, and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out; even though his tactic was to show how brave he was, the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind! This book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late, like it almost was for James. It was just an okay book and we hope James Frey's next book will be much more interesting 
 I loved the book as a kid and it's too bad they had to ruin it by making such a lame movie out of it. They could have done something much better with the story but instead tried to make it funny to both adults and kids. When will writers learn? Either MAKE IT A GROWNUP MOVIE OR MAKE IT A KIDS MOVIE! It's really hard to do both without kids going "Huh?" and adults going "funny but I can't explain it to the kids." Mike Myers was just UNFUNNY as the cat and his delivery of the jokes was rotten. He's barely funny anyway, (example, Waynes World where Mike is a 40 year old dude playing a teenager..also not funny) why would they put him in this movie? It really comes off like he is trying too hard, it's painful to watch. Jim Carey would have been way funnier as the cat in my opinion. I liked the colorful costumes and houses. Visually it was amazing and captured the look and theme of the book but everything else fell short. The kids acting was pretty good and the ending was funny. It's just too bad they made such a bad choice when casting the Cat. Mike ruined the movie and he was way too over the top. If I never see him 'act' again I would not be upset. The jokes in the movie were way too grown up, kids are smart and sadly a lot of them might actually understand this humor and it sets a bad example. I would not go so far as to say this movie is horrible, it's just not great overall 
 Their new stuff is even worse. But this is still sexist, boring, annoying music at its worst. There are much better artists out there, so why listen to these two untalented rappers 
 This is garbage.  This "author" uses the term 'guys' for wiseguys.  It is sooooo anoying that I just had to stop reading it.  Use mafia, wiseguys, whatever.  Try reading the word 'guys' about 20 times a page and see how sick you are of it. this person was not a mob 'guy' so don't bother with this book.  as a matter of fact I will sell you mine very cheap 
 This is a truly amazing book! This is a book written by a highly uneducated person for even less educated reader. As the author says in the introduction, this book is designed for young people of all ages... Well, what's that, "young of all ages?"  Simple: those "whose imagination has not been stifled by standard educational process."  At the very outset, the author reassures the reader that the book is not going to be a technical or scientific one. He says with a poorly concealed pride "My brush with academia was a fairly short one:  I was expelled from kindergarten at the age of four... and have never managed to resume normal studies since, not to mention graduating from anyplace."  As a result, "I am a fairly stupid fellow who could not learn any mathematics at all."  This lack of really serious knowledge of anything does not prevent the author from making judgments, always with a sort of  "elegance of ignorance", regarding very big topics, like, say, theory of relativity, and holography, and brain functioning (through electromagnetic and sound vibrations), and Biggg Banggg, of course. So, my recommendation to those with at least K12 education: do not waste time and find a better way to spend $9.97.    The most surprising aspect of  this book is that Dr. William Tiller, a  respected scientist and writer, found it possible to write a preface for this book.  This preface is the best part of the book. 
 I hate to jump on the bandwagon of all those who dislike Sandra Lee's approach to cooking.  I'm an avid watcher of most programs on the Food Network and while Lee is not my favorite chef, I find her entertaining and relaxing to watch on weekends.  Many criticize her because she isn't cooking, she just mixes up pre-packaged foods filled with sodium, fat, and preservatives to make mediocre concoctions that look and smell better than they taste.  I really wanted to like this book.  I flipped through the pages and saw the great explanation of slow cooking techniques and the beautiful full-color photos.  The book didn't seem overly-reliant on pre-packaged foods and I figured it would be a great guide for my new slow cooker.  This book has let me down.  I made the "Easiest Ever Paella" and it took twice the stated amount of time to cook and when it was done the rice was a gooey mess (consistency of old oatmeal or grits), the rice stuck to the bottom of the Crock Pot, and the dish was too salty for my palate.  On a second try I made the White Chili and it was mediocre.  I let it cook on low all day while I was at work and when I served it the beans were mushy and the flavor wasn't as full as I expected.  Did anybody test any of these recipes?  Where is she getting the food in the pictures?  The food I made looked absolutely nothing like the pics.  I'm giving this book 2 stars because the layout is nice and the pictures are great.  If you use some of the tips from the first section of the book, you can probably modify some of the recipes and save them from disaster.  My biggest criticism of Lee is that she assumes that her readers are too busy to even chop an onion, so she suggests using pre-chopped frozen onions.  Some of the ingredients in her book are difficult to find (or discontinued).  It often costs four times more to buy pre-prepared food than to spend ten extra minutes and do it from scratch.  If you want to cook fast, I suggest Rachel Ray's books.  She may have an annoying, goofy personality, but at least she cooks from scratch.  Her recipes haven't let me down yet 
 Bumiller refuses to take her informants at their word if what they are saying at all contradicts her preconceived notions about gender in Indian culture. She is treating some serious and important issues here, but I fear the journalist's tendency to put a sensational spin on things has made this book a stumbling-block to improved gender relations in India and other parts of the world. If you are looking for an introduction to important social issues in India--issues like bride burning, arranged marriage, or female infanticide--this is the wrong book for you. There are too many fictions mingled with the facts here 
 Oh my word.  I have only ever not been able to finish a book twice in my life -- and this was number 2.  The first few chapters were ok, but when things really started cooking plot-wise, the writing style became, well, high-schoolish.  I wanted to like it, so I plowed ahead.  But, half-way through it, I gave up.  The writing style is amateurish, and clunky.  Characters act in a melodramatically, with no realism.  There are patches of good writing, but these patches are quickly followed by a clunker or two.     I would hope that the sequel to this book improved, but since I can't finish the first, I won't be trying the second 
 My fiance and I bought this book at the suggestion of the rabbi who was performing our ceremony.  He was raised conservative and I was raised reform but at the time of our marriage was not relgious at all.  We both thought it a good idea to check out the book, mainly because the rabbi (conservative) recommended it.  In particular, I was interested in learning a bit more to blend in with my now-husband's family.    I think the problem with the book is that it was amazingly condescending.  Perhaps for people with absolutely no knowledge of Judiaism it wouldn't have been so.  However, to me it oversimplified many concepts, seem to claim there was only "one right way" to have a Jewish wedding in some respects, and left out the key information we were looking for -- namely the appropriate processional and recessional formations for a couple without significant family issues or discord.  My suggest about this book would be to purchase only if you have little or no prior knowledge of Judiasm or Jewish weddings.  Otherwise, it really did not go past the information we received from our Rabbi and our own personal knowledge 
 I tried half a dozen of the recipes and the drinks just don't taste right.  I also had a bad aftertaste on some.  I'd rather drink MUCH less of the real stuff than drink more of this awful stuff.  
 The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out 
  Idrove a car around three-quarters of the DR, using this book everystep of the way for nearly the entire trip. But many times the authorjust wrote a lot of nonsense. Places he describes aren't anything likethey really are, like he just asked other people to describe them andwrote what he heard from people who forgot a lot and gave him badinformation. This book is no good. 
 Germaine Greer's idea of a good-looking young man is pretty unusual: almost all of the "beautiful boys" in this collection are passive, dewy-eyed pseudo-girls.  And I'm not just saying this: one of the full-page color photos is of a Thai "kathoey" (drag queen).  You will not find very many photos of active, exuberant, competitive, handsome boys.  In fact, the phrase "handsome boys" may sum up what this book is missing.  I need hardly mention that her "special idea" of all this artwork being created for "the female gaze" is absurd.  Most women care nothing for casual sex or pornography, and scribblers like Germaine Greer can scribble their hands off without changing a thing!  There is such a thing as human nature, after all.  If women really liked visual erotica, we would know it by now: there would be millionaires who made their fortunes by tapping this market.  Instead, we seem to see the same old same old: men buying visual erotica, and woman buying romance novels -- and there ARE millionaires who can attest to the vibrancy of these markets!  There are, of course, some testosterone-heavy ladies out there -- and Greer must be one of them -- who think that their ideas of the good life must become mandatory for all thinking women.  Why?!  What ever happened to freedom, and the right to choose one's own life?  Does Germaine Greer show any respect for these ideas?  Palpable, visible, nonsense, and complete arrogance: trademarks of Germaine Greer 
      A relatively easy read.  The chronology is rather loose and jumps around more than I cared for.  Certain positive issues and programs sponsored by the Vatican are ignored.  Also, some negative situations addressed seems to be a more grabbing at straws to shore the argument, not much meat to them.  Other determining factors were well covered.  It could have been a little more balanced in my opinion.  Not my favorite read on the issue 
 I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. 
 However, since Equal and Nutrasweet became widely available -- I recall the products coming on the market around 1984 -- it's practically been a food group for me.  If I were going to drop dead, I think I'd have done it by now.  I notice that Splenda is being substituted for Nutrasweet in a lot of the products I've been buying for years.  Twenty years down the road, I'll probably be reading about the ways Splenda kills people.  Whatever 
 I enjoyed the book but the author's errors occurred in areas that I'm very unforgiving of.  In one place he mistakes semi-automatic firearms for fully-automatic firearms.  Even if the author doesn't feel obligated to do much research for light fiction like this, the editor should have caught something so blatantly wrong.    I enjoyed some of the ridiculous characters that always show up in his books.  But, like Stephen King, I'm beginning to notice that he has certain characters that he uses again and again.  The hermit in the woods that knows everything.  State troopers are always perfect and dedicated but feds and city cops are dummies.  Throw in a scene that involves a complicated sexual position.  It just seems a bit lazy.  I know it's light fiction, but I like a bit more flesh to my beach reading.  I should mention that I didn't actually "read" this book, I listened to the unabridged audio version 
 Yancey's problem is that he follows fads.  It's like in the movie, Good Will Hunting.  Most of the people studying an issue will follow the latest fad.  That's what Yancey does.  The title, "The Bible That Jesus Read", insults Jesus Christ, who is God -- the Second Person in the Holy Trinity.  The Old Testament and the New Testament clearly teach the Holy Trinity.  Gospel of John chpater 1 shows all Three Persons of the Holy Triity operating.  It is because people like Yancey has taken the helm of Christianity -- he is the editor of Christianity Today -- that America's Christianity is in grave trouble.  Ordaining homosexuals?  What do you think about that Yancey?  Is that a part of the "Bible that Jesus Read"?  Ridiculous! 
 Television is the only thing I have to look forward to, my life is sad and depressing and oh god I am going to cry  *** :( Get rid of television? are you insane?, how else would you get the children to shutu 
 When the "Dummies" series books first came out, they were truly for "dummies". Apparently not so anymore. Right on the cover of this book is the phrase "Go from Web surfer to site developer". Well, web surfer I am, and what I was looking for was a book to give me the ABSOLUTE BASICS about creating a web site. This book assumes that you as the reader, already know how to create a web site!! HELLO!! If I knew how to create a web site, I wouldn't need the book, thanks. Page 2 "Foolish Assumptions": "We figure that you have some kind of experience with creating web pages." WHAT?! I thought this book was going to turn me from a surfer to a developer. Page 27: the first line of chapter 3 reads "This chapter's here just in case you need a refresher on basic web page building before..." CHAPTER 3! Refresher! This book obviously should be titled "Enhancing Your Web Site for Dummies". This book does not even explain to a "Dummy" how to create the file necessary to create a web page. What a waste of twenty bucks 
 All the zombies kept telling me to purchase the Iliad and were raving about how intellectual it was.  The age of it should have been a first clue.  Really a rather boring read that is tripe with inept ideals.  Homer Simpson was named after this guy but I believe that he has more insight into the subject matter than the original home boy they call Homer.  Good for using to set your coffee mug on and start a fire with in the fireplace, but beyond that it is really a lot of rubbish.  I wish Penguin Classics would actually publish classic reading material instead of a lot of blah blah 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 It boils down to quitting your addiction, cold. And it's hard, really really hard. Personnaly speaking, I'm addicted to alcohol and cigarrettes. Lucky me, it's the "usual" ones. Without reading this book, yeah I'm being totally honest, just on the face of it, this book is BOGUS. If you're anywhere near a library, (thank you Carnegie!) check this guy out, for free. You'll "get it" real fast 
 This Movie gave me an actual reason to like shakespears writing and plays.  There was superb acting by all the actor and actresses and mainly Mr. James Earl Jones.  Just watching his anger and how it progressed through the play just gave a new meaning to acting, the way he used his facial expressions and when his saliva came pouring out of his mouth just showed how hard he worked to perfect his perfromance. As for the Director he could not have got a better cast. This is why i gave this mvie FOUR STAR 
 This long-overdue LIVE CD is just not worth the money. They should have released one way earlier when they were still big.  Get yourself the DVD of Live@25 instead - it's much much better and represents the band where it stands now: they have made enough bucks and just wanna have fun! Nice gig, excellent production, excellent picture 
 This is a very angry and hurtful book.  It is both biased and gossipy.  We were interested in reading the book because we believe that there is value in building each other up as people and would like to understand the difficulties that come with attempting to change the way we look at ourselves.  The world is full of hurt and anger and we find it quite ironic that Joyce Milton would would write such a scathing angry mean spirited book about those who attempted to elevate humanity; whatever the outcome of those attempts.   If you want a non-biased account of the greatness and the faults associated with this movement and its theories then you should not invest you time and energy into this book.  If you have already spawned an anger and judgment of human potential psychology then again there is no point to read this book, it is just more of the same.  You have already made a judgment and the author does not offer anything tangible since she does not give supporting documentation for very harsh accusations she makes of peoples lives.     
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 I can not describe how painful this book was.  The first quarter of the book goes at the pace of a moderately entertaining tale, but then grinds to a halt as soon as Silas is leashed with the orphan girl.  This book stands out in my memory not just for instilling a loathing of the written word that nearly took my away from literature for the rest of my life, but for the great amount of negative space it left in my brain when I try to recall some of the "excitement" of the drudgery of Silas's everyday life.  Truly a GREAT classic to unload on junior high children 
 If this is a re-issue of their 1994 debut album "Life", then can someone tell me why "Carnival" wasn't included?  I love the Cardigans, but for some strange reason their biggest hit in Europe was not included in this CD.  For that reason alone, I defintely do not recommned this album and I urge people instead to purchase "Life".  I give it 1 star because it is utterly perplexing why "Carnival" wasn't included.  
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 The idea that the Church must conform to society is laughable.  Christianity is not a popularity contest, it is immutable truth.  This book is totally heretical.  Don't get this book 
 As to the best of my knowledge, there were two major intellectual responses to the seemingly endless and insuperable crisis which the capitalist system had got itself into after the Great Slump of 1929: Keynes`s "General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment" of 1936 and Schumpeter`s "Capitalism" which was first published in 1942. Like Marx before them, both Keynes and Schumpeter reject the "classic economists'" contention that what they called the market system wll always automatically swing back to an ideal equilibrium - expecially one that implied full employment - provided only the state kept its hands off as much as possible.   However, that is just about where their concurrence ends. While Marx sees the only solution outside the system, in its bloody overthrow and its succession by a "dictatorship of the proletariat" introducing the next evolutionary step in human history, called socialism, Keynes considered the market system as basically viable. All that was needed, according to him, was governmental involvement by which the lacking demand in times of a slump would be lifted to more agreeable levels. Schumpeter, in contrast, agrees with Marx in that capitalism's days are counted and that it is about to be replaced by socialism, even though he doesn't share Marx`s more aggressive notions: according to him, the present day capitalists need not be dealt with by the guillotine alone, they may indeed have a useful function as entrepreneurs employed by his envisaged omnipotent and omniscient super agency that will ideally plan everybody's well-being in his imagined socialist system.  What to think of the book today? First, it is hard to fathom how Schumpeter could have turned such an absolutely blind eye on the totalitarian tendencies necessarily inherent in a state that not only controlled the political field but also was quasi the monopolist employer and as such responsible for the economic side of peoples's lives as well, in particular when one considers the time when it came out: 1942! Second, it is a fine example of how wrong you can get things even if (or: because?) you know so much as Schumpeter did - maybe that is the best argument of all against the establishment of such a super agency planning everybody's life to the extent envisaged by Schumpeter. Finally, even if such an agency did not err - is it not a basic right - and half of the fun of life - to make mistakes - for oneself that is, not forcing them on others 
 Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.  The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.  The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.  Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.  If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.   
 I bought this video cause it sounded nice if you were crunched for time, and it is that I suppose.  I felt like in the first 20 minutes I got a good workout.  The second 20 minutes wasn't as good, and the weight lifting segments seemed useless.   The biggest problem I had was I could not stand the instructor.  It's been mentioned that she can't cue to save her life, which is true.  You hear a lot of "now one more" followed by her doing 2 or 3 more.  It's like her body is not connected to her mouth, or something.  But the cuing wasn't the worst part.  Her constant blabbering really got to me.  I think she was trying to be motivating, but all it motivated me to do was turn off the tape.  I got tired of hearing, "you're doing great", "you're going to look so good", "god only gave you one body"--NONSTOP.  And she talked in this quiet patronizing tone, the kind you would use to talk to a disobedient child who you wanted to calm down.  I might suggest trying it without the sound--I think that's the only way this video could be handled 
 I purchased this book as well as FREE college and training money for women. Both books provide TONS of resources but you will need time to sift through them to determine your eligbility.   However the books are HUGE let downs in that they have duplicate information, not only on the pages of each book itself, but both of them carry identical programs or information. They simply changed the print and layout of the books.  My best advice is to buy whichever of Mr. Lesko's books you beleive is best suited to your own situation, and save your money, don't purchase any others.  You will only get repeat information 
 Long time fan, but didn't get much out of this one.  Stories were cute.  Didn't finish it, not worth more time 
 Where's the subtitle of this very effective book?  Did the modern editors simply take it away?  Darwin titled his book: "The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection" and subtitled it: "The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."  When Hitler came to power in 1933, he had one overarching idea in mind: his radical Nazi racial philosophy built on the Darwinian principle of natural selection.  Hilter thought the Aryans were the fittest and he wanted to help speed up the "inevitability" of natural selection.  He first started off with the sterilization of nine categories of "the unfit" which were feebleminded, schizophrenia, manic depression, Huntington's chorea, epilepsy, hereditary body deformities, deafness, hereditary blindness and alcoholism.  He then worked his way up to attempting the complete extermination of entire categories and entire races of people.  Speaking of modern day little Hitlers, the Columbine High School shooters carried out their bloody rampage on Hilter's birthday, April 20th, and had planned on causing more than 500 deaths at the high school.  Shooter Eric Harris had written on his website, "YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE??? Natural SELECTION!  It's the best thing that ever happened to the Earth.  Getting rid of all the stupid and weak organisms."  After the bloody rampage, Harris' autopsy report revealed that he was wearing a T-shirt with the words "Natural Selection" emblazoned on the front.  Beware of those who hold this book dear to their hearts.  This book is not about man descending from the apes.  The ideas in this book have caused and continue to cause more deaths than any other notion in modern history 
 Of all the books I have read and discussed, there is one book that we never should trust...when I got this book out from the library I was all geared up for a great read...therefore was greatly disappointed as I read this book.  MacDonald is unfortunately negative about all of The Beatles songs, and in particular has it in for George and Ringo's numbers. I found that he did not have a single positive comment about any of The Beatles songs - no matter who wrote them. It makes one wonder why he wrote a book on them. If you are looking for a book with a positive approach to the Beatles masterpieces, this isn't the book you should be buying. I reccommend "A Day In The Life, the Music and Artistry of The Beatles, by Mark Hertsgaard, instead of MacDonald's sloppy, single-minded musings. This book should be put to shame 
 I just finished with this book after solving the six categories of tests and scoring myself. I then tallied my highest categories and looked up the careers recommended for a person of my talents. Believe it or not, at the graduate level ALL of the careers recommended were those of a scientist or science intensive. Yeah, imagine that. Not one non scientific career. Now guess what? I am a young physician-scientist and I DONT like my job at all. How wrong can the recommendations get! Been there, done that and know for sure that this isnt the field for me.  My genuine interest is finance and banking and while I got a well above average score in the business test, several questions seemed to rely on knowledge one would be expected to glean from an MBA or by working in the business world, and not any innate ability. Having never gone to B School or worked in a Business Industry, I felt short changed. Whats more, a test remarkably similar to this one had been administered at my school when I was in the tenth grade and I was told that I was most suited to a career in science.Ironically enough now I know that that is the one career I can say for sure isnt the one for me. Go figure 
 I am going to give this 2 stars instead of only one and only because, not being a New Age believer, I may be being unduly harsh with my criticism.  I just have a hard time with this whole Self Help genre.  Truthfully, I only read half the book.  Pfff! It never caught my interest. It starts out with an explanation of your Lower Self and your Higher Self as if the evidence of the existence of either is indisputable.   Then we move into the obligatory "positive affirmations", physically cleaning out our closets, joining 12 step programs, choosing not to be a victim, meditating, praying, tai chi and on and on.  If you feel that any of this may help you Dance with Life, then I admire your faith.  Me, I'll just continue to refill my prescription for Prozac.         
 This is a terrible album.  I listen to pretty much anything, and one day my roomate pulled this cd up.  I absolutely hate the Super Furry Animals, and with a terrible name like that, it should be evident that this is a horrible band. The music is uninspiring and boring to listen to.  I have pity for anyone who religiously listens to this type of "music. 
 I was very disappointed in this book .I thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only.   Who cares about the daily life of the corporate CEO?  I wanted to know the man.  What were his parents like, what kind of a childhood did he have?  How about some pictures of Jack the kid? Who was his wife of twenty eight years, what are her opinions of Jack, as a man and a father?  How about his children, do they have insights into their fathers feelings?   What experiences in his life molded him into what he became?  These and many other questions were not answered.   How can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes?    Try it again Janet, the third time never fails 
 Well, I should have known. The jacket flap said "will do for Dante what the DaVinci code did for Michelangelo"... nice try.  I knew I was being sucked in by someone trying to ride on the "DaVinci Code" hype. I was right. Someone looked at this book and the DVC million$ and thought "we gotta get this one translated". Nice try guys!  It reads like either a clunky translation or (worse?) just a poorly-written book to begin with. I'm willing to give the original author and original-language edition the benefit of the doubt, but the translation itself certainly lacks almost everything DVC had in the "oomph" department.  Lets face it, Dan Brown knows how to write a potboiler! DVC letd me to his other books and I enjoyed every one in a "great summer beach reading" sense.  Someone got the idea that Brown's genius was in theme-context: in his assault on proto-christian ideology and history. Read his other stuff and you'll see he does it with words, regardless of theme, and his Christ/Catholic church  bashing is no more unusual than his other icon-bashing of NASA in the arctic/spaceship book - name escapes me.  Brown is no Dante (or Mich.) but he is fun to read. This one ain't.  Exploitation of cultural main-vein$ at its worst. Unreadable, murky, poorly-translated (I hope !) 
 After reading so many glowing reviews, this book was a real disappointment.  It is very long on self-congratulatory anecdotes on how well this "method" works and how great it is to have an unspoiled child, and very short on concrete examples of what to do.  It also contains lots of references to how scary it is and how miserable you'll be if you don't get your child under control by age 2, which is not helpful when the book fails to give many examples of what to do to avoid such dire circumstances 
 Tripe, its own self.   I've watched grass grow with more verve and enthusiasm. Disch is an author who was let in when the publishers opened the sci-fi floodgates in the mid-60s...and it shows. 
 BEFORE YOU READ THIS BOOK, PLEASE...  -Utilize the abundance of alternate materials, resources and books on this subject by highly respected professionals and experts.  -Cease recommendation of this book to students, parents or those in need, immediately.  -Examine and explore the mounting sources in the media, newspapers and on-line regarding controversies, signed affidavits, criminal wrongdoing, lawsuits, settlements, insurance fraud, and malpractice related to the now defunct Kids of Bergen County, Kids of North Jersey, and Straight of Florida, where Newton gained his "professional experience" and practiced his "treatment model," as founder and director.   -Read materials which enlighten us with the allegations about what actually occurred behind the closed doors of Newton's "treatment programs" and are omitted from this book. Educate yourself about what children in Newton's care say they really experienced, including: violent physical assaults; extreme emotional abuse and manipulation; depravation of an education, sleep, lavatory use and professional help; false imprisonment and kidnapping; malpractice, denial of a patient's bill of rights, use of physical restraint as a punishment and a motivational tool to control responsiveness, admitting individuals on intakes based on determinations made by other children, absence of any health professional during these intakes and during therapeutic sessions, and throughout the course of treatment; falsifying documents regarding the presence of mental health professionals, as well as incident & treatment related reports and insurance documents; allegations of sexual abuse suffered by individuals while in Newton's care by other adolescents, teens or parents, forcing children including preteens to listen to graphic, sexually explicit stories in detail, coercion of pregnant minors to receive an abortion, group strip searches, refusal and depravation of necessary medical treatment,... 
 I was very disappointed. The unit looks like a cheap knock-off and the user guide is not adequate. Not user friendly. 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book. The theory is very inaccurate. The authors don't seem to have a grasp on what working memory is or on mental models. I was looking for a book that applies the practice of graphics in education to sound theory. This is not it. 
 	I Do not recommend this book because of the characters, the lack of a clear objective and the ending, that left me depressed and unsettled. Joel was one of the characters that bothered me. I didn't like the way he handled the situation when his friend died. The way he waited before telling anyone, and they way he acted angry at his parents and the Zabrinskys for no reason at all bothered me a lot. " `Joel', She said, `are you sure you've told us everything you know?' `About what?' he demanded roughly as if he didn't understand what she meant." Another thing I disliked about the book was, there wasn't a clear plot or objective to the story. After Tony's death, the rest of the book was basically about Joel trying to tell someone about it. I found that very boring. The last thing that left a discontented feeling in my mind was the ending. By the middle of the book, I was very sad, and by the end of the book, that feeling never went away. After Tony's death I found that there was no silver lining, or feel of hope at the end. This left me unhappy. The story just sort of cut off, leaving you sad and a little confused. Those were some key reasons I do not recommend the book On My Honor. 
 Twenty-something Bette lives in Manhattan, has a close knit group of friends, enjoys romance novels, and apparently possesses little fashion sense or celebrity IQ. Everyone Worth Knowing is the story of how she becomes an accidental success in the surreal world of celebrity public relations, and finds romance--real and fictional--along the way.   Maybe it's just me, but Bette seems to have problems many people would love to "suffer" through. Although told a lot of things about her, I never got the feeling I could really picture Bette or understand what she wanted, even in the end. Her story feels underdeveloped and many of the events predictable or random. Still, if you liked The Devil Wears Prada and enjoy modern formulaic romances, you will probably enjoy Everyone Worth Knowing 
 I found the story interesting but the book itself jumps around too much in time.  One chapter is after her death and then it relates interviews with witnesses before her death etc. Just found it hard to follow.  
 I found this book disappointing, especially after reading the description and the glowing reviews posted here.  I thought I would get a lot more tips on how to clean quickly and efficiently, but I only found one tip I felt would make a difference.  I also thought the book would give a better plan of attack for cleaning the whole house, but the plan was scattered throughout the book.  I would have liked to have seen that plan presented in a single place (perhaps as a review at the end of the book.)  I also felt this book just scratched the surface of the hows and whys of cleaning and organizing.  I think people would be much better served buying two separate books that go more in depth into both topics.  I don't know which book to suggest for cleaning, but for organizing "Organizing From The Inside Out" by Julie Morganstern is the best.  
 The quality of this isnt great- the sound of the "waterproof" material is loud.  I dont like the side material and think it will fall apart easily.  I would save your money and buy the more expensive one that has better quality.  
 I've enjoyed Pavel's previous works, and find his insights and knowledge refreshing when compared to the mainstream; but sadly I can not recommend this book.  The Russian Kettlebell Challenge is 143 pages long and in my opinion, the majority of the book is filler--I counted only 66 pages with valid information on Kettlebell lifting (and that's being generous).  There are eleven blank pages (fifteen counting the four section pages) and sixteen pages that were a maximum of half full.  The first two sections of the book (32 pages!) were comprised of the history of Kettlebells, and Pavel's reasoning on why they're so great.  This book reminded me of one of my college term papers were I had procrastinated until the last minute, and used every possible technique to stretch the length of the paper.    At $34.95, this book is definitely not worth the price.  
 The worksheets are helpful in applying what Malphurs has just covered. The book is loaded with practical hints and tips. The biggest drawback is that Malphurs relies too heavily on statistics that are questionable and cites some that contradict each other. By that I mean that he cites a statistic about 'Protestant' churches which includes Mormons and Jehovah's Witness. Instead I would recommend Stuart Murray's "Church Planting: Laying Foundations" 
 Mildly entertaining, but overpriced. The authors don't seem to have credentials as critics, writers, or theorists - but this is more of a hobby book. I also couldn't figure out which press published this book. Could this be a vanity press? If you want everything LOST, OK for a collection - but not as a primary source of insight or criticism about the show. 
 a weak offering from wyatt, continuous and not defined. almost some kind of concept album running together. instead try "ruth is stranger than richard" or" theatre royal drury lane " both very good rep's of wyatts work.... 
 The premise and style of the book are very interesting and I applaud John for his creativity and ability to write from a feminine perspective (See John's blog 'The Whatever.'  He has a post up to a web page that analyzed the prose and determined the author was a woman.)  Overall I found this book a bit of a chore.  By chapter 4, I was bored, wondering where the amorphous narrative was going, and slogging through the rest was unappetizing at best.  I heartily recommend John Scalzi's other SciFi works, but not this one.  
 I'm sorry but the few funy scenes aren't woth he grossness and the stupidity of thsi film. I don't know what about it hit me the wrong way But jst like the movie 'Antz' I feel sick at the thought of it. Maybe it's the scene where the bug pulls up the ant's head or the need to make every thing as ew as possible or maybe the ant religion. Please if you want a good, CLEAN bug movie rent or buy 'Bugs Life' and skip this gross film 
 Okay, if you aren't trying to get anything from this experience.  A snooze.  Seriously 
 Hmm, you'd think for such a paradigm breaking book Lubenow would have the credentials necessary for this critical analysis. No, Ph.D. in anthropology (or even in the biological sciences for that matter), no published peer-reviewed journal articles dealing with the issue at hand. If he's so correct in this, why didn't he ever submit his work to the scientific journals (where REAL science is done afterall)? He must be afraid of honest criticsim, that's why you publish to those who already agree with you, it's called preaching to the choir.   oh wait, it's probably because of the conspiracy...yeah that's it 
 What a disappointment!  I ordered PASSIONATE HEARTS as a gift for  newlyweds and must return it to AMAZON because it is so weak.  A very few  good poems surrounded by many unimaginative, cliche-ridden, excusses for  poetry.  This book needed CPR from a editor who hears the vigorous  heartbeat and ecstacy of fine literature instead of the fragmentary  palpitations of 2nd-rate amateurs 
 I fell for it and I'm sorry. I like looking at Pottery Barn catalogs so I thought this book would be interesting. It's not. "Pottery Barn" and "style" don't go together because Pottery Barn sells a canned look whereas style is all about doing your own thing today and not buying into a canned look.  Pottery Barn should keep selling furniture and stay out of trying to do decorating books. This one falls flat. It's downright dreary 
 Incompatible with my iBook; Apple has such a phobia against providing 'System Requiremts' for their accessories; finally found the list on a vendors website.  Amazon did not have this list.  One has to do major resarch to find the info Apple won't provide !  
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's basically a movie about 3 kids who grew up together only one was emotionally scarred for life as a child. As they grow up they all go their seperate ways until another horrific event brings them all together again for one more sad, unsettling experience together. Does anyone grow or learn anything? No. Do the "bad guys" pay? No. It is difficult for me to say just how much this movie sucks without giving away the ending. Suffice to say that no one wins, innocent people get screwed over, and in the end - no one really learns anything. It's a thoroughly depressing movie with no point - unless the point is that life sucks. As if viewers don't have enough of their own problems, or as if real life isn't traumatizing enough - we are subjected to this horrible 2 1/2 hours of misery. I am not exaggerating - there is no redeeming value to this movie. Sure the acting is great, but what good is it with such a tragic story. And this is not like a Greek Tragedy or Shakespeare Tragedy - there are no heroes, no lessons to be learned, no moral to the story - it just makes you feel miserable and hollow and then nothing - just the credits rolling. This movie is so terrible that I would rather watch "Kazaam" than watch this again 
 You'll never get the straight story about nationalism out of Eric Hobsbawm, who himself appears to try to reconcile his own ethnic identity with the topic.  David Pryce-Jones once noted that in Hobsbawm's own autobiography: "he [Hobsbawm] boasts of a visit to Bir Zeit University on the West Bank to display solidarity with the Palestinians.  Why Palestinian nationalism is valid, and Jewish nationalism invalid, is something else Hobsbawm fails to analyze and explain. Quite crudely, he approves of nationalism in countries which proclaim themselves Communist and anti-American, like Cuba or Vietnam, while rejecting nationalism in countries which are not Communist and are pro-American, like Israel" ([...], Jan. 3, 2003).  Such twisted thinking is evident through "Nations and Nationalism," where Mr. Hobsbawm spares no effort, however subtle, to demean nationalism that doesn't conform to his pre-existing prejudices.  In short, when writing about nationalism, Mr. Hobsbawm allowed his considerable analytic and writing skills to become corrupted by his religion, communism.  Therefore, unless you are an acolyte of that religion, this book is not worth your time, money or effort to read, and if you *are* a member of that religion, I suggest you broaden your intellectual horizons a bit, perhaps by reading Liah Greenfield's "Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity" or Benedict Anderson's "Imagined Communities. 
 Being motherless affects so much of who I am; I realized this through Edelman's previous book, "Motherless Daughters". I laughed and cried my way through the pages of that book, so I was intrigued by the publication of "Motherless Mothers".   While very informative in many aspects (she begins to deal with the specifics of mothering from pregnancy all the way through grandparenting and so on...), I found many of her statements to be too broad of a stroke to cover the ever so intimate and personal experience of the loss of one's mother: ultimately, there are too many variables in one's life to truly come up with an effective statistic, so many of the ones presented, also, so bleak.  Much like with "Motherless Daughters", I loved Edelman's personal stories (written with SO MUCH LOVE) as well as those of the women she interviewed in "Motherless Mothers". In a sense, reading this book was like revisiting a friend after several years and finding she had grown up, matured and had healed what seemed to be open wounds last time I read her.  Still, would I recommend this book? Not over her previous one, no. There are many parenting books I have found more effective in helping me understand who I am as a parent (as well as improving my parenting skills, a nice consequence of understanding who you are) 
 Although Valley Girl came out when I was a teenager, it somehow eluded me until now. I bought it because of the favorable reviews, and of course, for the sheer nostalgia. I won't say it's a BAD movie, but I would compare it directly to The Last American Virgin in terms of screenplay, story and acting. Unlike The Last American Virgin, however, this film has an awful sountrack, and it didn't really end in a notable way.  From a filmmaking standpoint, this seems amateurish. Apparently this is where director Martha Coolidge cut her teeth, because she went on to direct the remarkably good college film, Real Genius, just two years later.  The big problem with this film is shallowness. We never learn much about any of the characters, so it's not easy to care about them. I still can't figure out why the lead characters were attracted to each other, since the only way they ever describe each other is "hot". They never engage in deep conversations or share secrets with each other. There's no depth to the relationship at all.   Another problem is that all the high school students in this film appear to be about 18-22 years old, while the sexy mother of one teenage girl appears to be under 30 years old herself. A whole subplot that revolves around the mother (Beth, played by Lee Purcell) is unsatisfactorily resolved about half-way throught the film, then never mentioned again. Even so, I like her temptations a lot more than Stifler's Mom in American Pie!  Lisa Foreman's lead character, Julie, behaves less like a "Valley Girl" of the 1980's than she does an ordinary middle class teenager living in Overland Park, Kansas. If you're familiar with Moon Unit Zappa's song, "Valley Girl", you'll find almost none of that kind of language in this film. Nicolaus Cage's character, Randy, is likeable enough, but he looks more like a member of Jefferson Starship than a "punk" (his almost mullet-like hair is blown upward on top--that's it!). Unfortunately, for an "odd couple" story like this to work, you need to emphasize the extreme difference between the characters. But these characters could have easily been neighbors from childhood. They don't seem at all from the other side of the tracks.  The obligatory montage scene fails because it continues for the entire length of the song, "I'll Melt With You". A montage is meant to compress time, and dragging it out for an entire song defeats that purpose. They should have faded it out after 45-60 seconds for more effect.  The most entertaining characters in the film, by far, are Julie's parents--a couple of former hippies who were obviously the prototype for Berke Lander's parents in the hilarious 2001 teen film, "Get Over It".   The soundtrack, too, is terribly inferior to The Last American Virgin, and doesn't represent the early 1980's well at all. Only the aforementioned "I'll Melt With You" stands out as a great song. Meanwhile, a tune that repeats the question "Johnny Are You Queer?" seems oddly out of place at a preppy high school prom.   From a nostalgia standpoint, I didn't feel like I was watching an 80's movie at all. In fact, the most pleasant nostalgia in the film was seeing ashtrays on every table (even though the characters didn't smoke), which reminded me for the first time in years that California was once part of a free country, and wasn't always ruled by neurotics. Frankly, I was surprised that the Orwellian thought-police hadn't airbrushed all those ashtrays out of the film. Today, every surface in California is littered with a fear-mongering Proposition 65 warning stickers instead. I'm so grateful I was a teenager in the 1980's, rather than today!  Overall, this film fails on too many counts to recommend it, but I wouldn't blame you for checking it out. It's good enough fun for 99 minutes. The Special Edition DVD adds quite a few features that make the DVD worthwhile, if you can get it cheap! 
 Chingy is god-awful and should not be allowed to make any more cd's.  I remember in the late 80's and early 90's you could actually enjoy listening to rap on the radio, and mtv.  I know avoid both of them like the plague, because of artists like chingy.  This is a piece of advice for the people reading this who actually LIKE Chingy... There is way better hip-hop out there, take advantage of the internets scary power.  Check out independent labels like Def Jux, Rhymesayers, Strange Music, Fastlife, Legendary, Soul Spazm, etc.  These are just a handful of labels that are doing great things for hip hop and are guess what.... ORIGINAL and TALENTED 
 First the pros: clear plastic window is designed to cover keys as well as the screen, protecting them from wear. Fit is tight so the case takes up little additional space in my pocket.  Now cons: dirt and debris easily finds its way between the plastic and the phone. this actually exacerbates the damage as the dirt grinds between the plastic and the phone. The plastic screen also attracts dust. When I tried to remove the phone for cleaning, the side of the case ripped.  All in all, I would not have bought this product again. Please avoid 
 This the first of Daninell's books I read.  I learnt that she was the Queen of romance novel since I was a teen.  I'm a little disappointed by the book because it's really boring for most of the part. It's like reading an alternative version of Princess Diana's traffic accident.  I realize that Daniell likes to repeat herself a lot.  There are too many reptitions of descriptions of all kinds.  It's also too predictable.  To me, everything that Bill did is really cheesy and unreal and his stubborness of rejecting and denying Anabelle after he became paralysed makes me wonder what a tyranny psycho he is that he just wants to inflict pain on the woman who loves him and who has nobody there for her at all. It's really hard to believe any man who acts so unreasonably stubborn on his own version of love and happiness that he can actually be an ideal partner for any woman.  Men like that are normally pretty controlling and emotionally abusive. This is the major element in the book that really turns me off.   I have to admit that the last part where Anabelle finally convinced Bill to be with her is quite touching.  I think Ms. Steel does have her crowds of fans.  My boyfriend's mother had been crying all the way thru the book.      
 I am taking a class in Dreamweaver and Flash.  One of my teachers has required that we purchase this book and the other teacher in my flash class has us purchasing a book by lynda.com. I hate this book because if you don't know what you are doing, don't buy this book.  They leave out a lot of important information.  I got so frustrated in trying to finish the exercises that I just would eventually stop.  Further in the book they might tell you what you needed to know back a few chapters ago.  Poorly written.  Not for beginners.  The other book was great.  Lynda.com books are more in detail and they are written correctly.   
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 For A.S. this CD was a huge disappointment. There are no laugh-out-loud, roll on the ground, bits here. No Toll Booth Willies, No Goats, No buffoons. I could accept that, but there's nothing even CLOSE. The closest you get is Psychotic Uncle Donnie. At least that one got me to actually quote it, "Let's try a little reverse action!"    The songs are pretty weak compared to past efforts, but what strikes me as the biggest problem with this CD is the amount of unfunny filler. Whitey is a total waste of 16 minutes. There's not a single laugh in it. I was amazed when that character found it's way into the 8 Crazy Night's film. At least 8.C.N. delivered laughs. This is simply listening to a high pitched moron for 16 minutes, talk about a shopping mall. The Peeper is just dumb, and we've seen it before. The loser who hates himself..okay, we get it. Cool Guy segments are just an attempt to recapture "the Buffoon" from Laugh At You, but they fall well short. There are just way too few laughs here to give it any more than 2 stars, and that's being generous. 
 I am very dissapointed in the service of Amazon.  I put in the name of the book and was guided to the 5th edition instead of the latest version(6th).  There was no way to verify the edition on line at the time of purchase. This appears to me to be a scam by Amazon to divest themselves of the old inventory.  When I found the error and did additional research to obtain the ISBN number I found the 6th edition.  Since then, the search in Amazon has been updated and both editions appear.  Still no reference to editions but surprizingly the 5th edition is priced higher.  Another part of the scam to trick buyers to buy the 5th edition because logic thinking would put the newer/latest edition at a higher price then the older obsolete 5th edition.  When Amazon management was presented with the issue; my error, no can help you.  Guess what, for basicly shipping charges of the two books, Amazon has lost my future business and the bad PR to all I talk to in the future.  Sure hope the balance sheet improved due to the shipping charges.  Greatly Dissatisfied Custome 
 This product does not work with Windows 2003 Server, and it doesn't call that out on the box.  This is 3 or 4 years after 2003's release and they need to indicate it on the box or customers like me will bring it home and it won't work 
 Me like this book. When I got my potty, I weared it on my head like the little girl in the book. Mommy said it looked so cute.  W E E W E E .......I DID IT MYSELF! YAY ME! I MADE A WEE WEE 
 I bought this book because I thought it'd be fun and interesting, but I was wrong. There were many tests which were interesting and I didn't mind taking the time to answer the forty to sixty questions. What bothered me was when I finished answering all the questions I was left completely confused. I'd find out my score for a test, but it didn't tell me if my score was a good thing or a bad thing. Instead it showed the results of other people, which I really didn't care about. I only wanted to know about my score, which I didn't get. I hope others were able to find this book helpful because I sure didn't 
 I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all 
 I purchased this coat online for my husband.  He needed a new topcoat to wear over his suits at work.  Although it looks pretty nice in the picture, it is poor quality.  This coat is pretty thin and wrinkles fast.  Because it is so light in weight, it doesn't hang well.  It also had a small white mark (almost looked like wax) on the lapel.  It is not the same quality as most department store top coats.  If you are looking for something that looks professional, I wouldn't recommned it.  I found a better topcoat for the same price on sale at Macy's by Ralph Lauren.  I returned this coat to Jos Banks.  
 I'm studying for the CPA. I bought the book because it's required for a course in school. But to actually learn for the CPA exam, I'll toss this one aside for one that provides a solutions manual. Authors who withold the manual for the instructors benefit miss a fundamental point about economics - who the customer is. It's the student that the book is written for and it is the student who pays for the course. Breffni University of Chicag 
 Chromosome 6 has a great premise: what happens if medical technology accelerates to the point that scientists can create genetic doubles for people; doubles who serve as living organ reservoirs for possible future organ transplant needs-a sort of biological insurance policy? How much would people pay for this service? How far would they go to protect it? What are the moral implications?  Robin Cook comes full circle, returning to the themes of his 1970s novel, Coma. Coma is the novel that first made us aware of the dangers of corporate medicine and greed; of the subtle but relentless destruction of the long-standing relationships patients had with doctors, and the dignity those relationship once preserved. Now, a quarter century later, Robin Cook is shown to have been eerily prescient as technology has caught up to his nightmare.  Chromosome 6 is a very believable scenario of a technology designed with the best of intentions being corrupted for the sake of profit. In this novel, there is mystery and murder; medical sleuthing and exotic, international sets. There are a host of characters whose paths will intersect at some point-the set up is brilliant and we read with eager anticipation-but...this novel is so poorly written that I cannot believe it has Robin Cook's name on it. Though not high literature, Robin Cook's novels have always been tight and suspenseful, with believable characters and settings that seemed real. The characters in Chromosome 6 are as flat as road kill, the action as watered down as a glass of coke left in the sun until all of the ice has melted. Turn a page and the story just ends...what? That's it? Are you kidding? Did Robin Cook really write this? I don't think so.  
 I hoped the CD would contain more material but it didn't give me more than reading the book 
 Although Widdowson is the editor of the Oxford Introductions to Language Studies series this book does not have the same feel as others in the series. The format is the same with a selection of readings following the author's introduction. However, this book seems to have been written as an introduction for experienced linguists. It contains all of the information but with none of the details that would make it a pleasant read for novices. Ultimately, trying to squeeze everything there is to be said about linguistics into 77 pages is an impossible task and makes for an unprofitable read.  That said, the selection of readings is particularly strong and Widdowson asks some pointed questions of each author. It is at times very apparent what answer he expects because he goes on to ask questions based on what his answer would be. This would annoy those who disagree with him.  This book only rated two stars because I expected more from the series editor. Widdowson seems to have missed the second word of the series title: introductions. Only those with a graduate level reading ability in the field of linguistics would find this book enjoyable. I would recommend Jean Aitchison's book instead (0340870834). It is highly readable and geared more for the novice 
 I had to write because I am amazed that no one yet has commented on how graphic and gruesome this book is!  Four women in my book club couldn't finish this book because they were so grossed out by the gratuitous scenes in it.  Yes, you will learn a bit about the loss of Hawaiian culture and what the Hawaiians have suffered at the hand of foreigners, but every minute detail of this book is negative and depressing.  There is definitely a lot of doom and gloom in this book.  Horrible, graphic things continue to happen to all of the characters throughout the story.  Yet, the characters do not seem to overcome their shortcomings and misfortunes; instead, they succumb to them.  I thought this was going to be a book about strong triumphant women, but instead felt it was a depressing lesson in Hawaiian history that missed an opportunity to garner the respect it should have.  
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 it was ok but could have been alot better.  it seemed to lag at places and they could have done things a bit more creepy but alas it didn't happen..........a reporter finds out she is pregnant and goes online to find a womens clinic to see about an abortion since her news anchor boyfriend doesn't want the baby since it would be damaging to his career.  while searching online she comes across one and clicks on the site then goes in for a visit and the movie is suppose to take off from there but it doesn't.  it basically turns out she is still pregnant which causes problems at work and with her boyfriend.  she teams up with a detective who finally tells her she will die in 15 days from clicking on the website for the women clinic and they start investigating the clinic and the apartment of the previous victim.  the end was rather lame as she gives pseudo birth when her boyfriend admits he forced his prevoius girlfreind to have an abortion. so unless you are really desperate for something to watch and can pick this up for a dollar and want to kill a bit of time i would not recommend watching this although it is better than some of the stinkers i have come across lately 
 I actually bought one of these in the store and was browsing Amazon for a replacement. The fact that most of the ones in the store display were broken should have been a tipoff. The wires that do the slicing were all broken. These were all the had, so I thought I'd give it a shot. It didn't even make it home. Several of the wires came unattached from the ends. I'm hoping maybe they just had a bad batch. Though I usually like KitchenAid products, I certainly wouldn't recommend this item to anyone 
 While this can be helpful for the average person looking to improve their health a little by eating healthier, it isn't a great book for those looking to get more serious about their health and for more details about coverting to a raw diet. It's not a bad book, but there is a lot of information missing and it seems to encourage you to still eat a lot of unhealthy foods. The recipes are okay, not great and not all raw. There is some useful information, but might be confusing to most. There are better books out there regarding the raw diet. 
 There is simply not enough value in this book to justify using it.  I'm sorry but words like Alta Vista and Cisco just should not appear anywhere in a value investing book.  Period and discussion over.  At least not up to the present.  Maybe in the future but I doubt it.  Also there is way too much verbage to describe much of nothing.  The modern budding value investor would be better served by other book including Security Analysis by Graham.  A lot of detail is missing here and much of the analysis leaves one wondering if the authors know what value investing really is 
 please ...please before you start your laying out....im sure it won't take long to figure out the dimensions on the plans...on your own none of the dimensions add up ...take the lighthouse for example..pg 106-109 the octogons are all messed up pg. 108 add up the bottom octogondimensions .  1 3/4..+ 1 3/4..+ 2 1/2..does  NOT add up to   6 1/16 ..did this book HAVE an editor?   a comment from anyone who feels this way would be welcome 
 Great acting and action!  Libeling Thomas Dewey ruined the movie for me.  Thomas Dewey put mobsters in jail.  He didn't take money from them and no evidence exists that he did.  Hoodlum is a complete fabrication.  I can't understand attacking the reputation of a good man. Disgusting.  Also the role of Bumpy Johnson was overstated.  He didn't have such power.  Decent movie but absolutely rotten history 
 I rely on customer reviews when deciding on a book. Apparently the three reviews I read that appeared to be helpful turned out to be a  disappointment. This book is obviously written for someone with a very  extensive vocabulary. It is filled with $10.00 words and ideas that are  really hard to decipher. I was under the impression, via the other 3  reviews, that this book would provide an explanation of  "mindblindness" in terms the average layman could understand.   After reading the  first two chapters, I had to go back and read them again  and again. I suggest you try to find this one at the public library before  you decide to permenantly add it to you own personal collection. Save your  money and the shipping charges 
 I am conservative on most issues but I do have some problems with our strategies in the Iraq war.  I have a very liberal friend who is in love with the term "Neocon".  He is constantly critizing me for reading "right wing" propaganda so I said I would give his idea of a great book a try.  I read a little over half of the book and I couldn't take it anymore.  I found myself dreading getting back to the book each day, to me this is just a liberal antiwar hit piece.  There are some good questions in the book on our strategies and troop deployment.  But the author's hate of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Rice take over and cloud every chapter.  He makes the Neocons sound like Dr. Evil's Chamber in the Austin Powers movies.  His referencing was always from the far left blogs and publications, he constantly referenced conversations that could never be substantiated.  My friend told me this was a historical book, apolitical, I think not.  Read it if you want to, I couldn't get through it.  Ann Coulter is an idealogue, but at least she is funny 
 First let me state that the terms "technotrash pseudo-fiction" are not intended to be negative in the sense that this book is trash to be ignored or thrown away. What is significant here is the genre of technotrash pseudo-fiction. See the other reviews to get a feel for what I am talking about. The book reads like a story, which it is. It offers up that comfort food satisfaction for the mind that many crave--just like pulp fiction! So, if you are looking for any sort of depth or a cut-to-the-chase analysis, this book is a waste of time--in fact, just browse the book here at Amazon and read the reviews. I use the descriptor pseudo-fiction because the book is not fiction, it is just layman science served up that way.  Two stars for being well-written, two stars for lack of depth and far too much fluff 
 What does WILD THINGS 2 have going against it from the get-go: A) No Denise Richards  B) No name actors  C)Being a crappy direct-to-video sequel  D)No Denise Richards NAKED . . .   What is wrong with WILD THINGS 2 after the fact:   A)A script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew  B)ONE sex scene -- A (weak) threesome, one of the few things even linking this to the original C)Sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked (leaving us with a body double and naked-from-behind shot) . . . Wait let me play that again!  If I seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an EROTIC THRILLER.  Did I mention no Denise Richards? 
 This book was a huge disappointment. It's content is weak in almost all sections with much of the information available from either the Internet or you local photo lab. I didn't find it very useful at all and I'm even tempted to send it back.  The book is pretty much broken up into the three section as described in the book's title. The first part brushes over optimising your workspace - calibrating your monitor - and selecting a printer and then basic printing output. Things most people know already.   The second goes into a bit more depth regarding getting your pics on the web: registering a domain name, selecting a hosting company, etc. Information you'll find better provided by a quick search in any web search engine. However, one of my main gripes is that it reads like a magazine review of 3rd party programs you should buy to help with the web authoring in html. In fact it advises using Macromedia Dreamweaver.  A program which cost more than 500 USD. Now, I understand that writing html sounds complicated to the novice but you would - honestly - be better served and save some money from learning a bit from any basic html/web authoring book(any of the O'Reilly books are well recommended) Creating a basic html web gallery is not complicated.   The final part of the book continues on the team of glossing over the subject. It briefly mentions approaching galleries and selling on the Interent. I was expecting so much more from ths section but I really didn't learn much more than I knew already.   I find it hard to believe that one of the reviews here gives this book 5 stars yet points out some of the same failings of the book as me. The book has good intentions but just doesn't deliver the level of content and information required to make really useful. 
 Terrible, all around bad movie. Don't waste your time 
 The box set made by IMAGE (not ELITE) does not have all of the technical  problems that Paul Kesler wrote of in his review 
 I have laughed and shed tears over all of the authors books. Im am completely dumbfounded as to what he was thinking when he wrote At First Sight.  Like me, you probably loved all the characters in his previous books.  He makes every character in this book NOT loveable! I kept asking myself, who am I rooting for?  Do I care if things go well?  The best part were the medical issues but only a few pages in the book - could have been a story in itself.  I miss the old spark. 
 I actually couldn't finish this book.  Never before have I set down a book and conceded defeat, but for some reason I simply could not take any more of the asinine assumptions, lies, stupid miscommunications, or dishonest emotions.  It was just so incredibly frustrating!  Maybe I've just read too many romances lately, but it seems to me that many of them rely on two scenarios: a)girl and boy meet, girl makes wrongful assumption of boy and is a complete witch about it, then spends rest of book realizing mistake OR b)girl and boy meet, fall in love, girl and boy have lapse in communication and make wrongful assumptions about each other and nearly end their relationship because of their obvious lack of honest communication skills.    I just wanted to take these two characters and shake them!  Neither of them were listening to the other when arguing, which in a marriage is understandable, but to let an argument of that particular magnitude go unresolved for so long a time made me want to punch my pillow.  I ended up putting it down when she got kidnapped and have been a much happier lady as a result.    I have read other Madeline Hunter books and enjoyed them, but I found the writing in this one not up to par with her normal.  In reading the other reviews, I can't for the life of me figure out if it's just me, or if the other reviewers just really, really enjoy watching two people behave in an infuriatingly and overused cliched manner.  
 As he does in his columns, Mr. Tierney demonstrates here grave literary weakness.  There is no reason that this book should ever have appeared.  I cannot imagine even the dullest mind finding it interesting or amusing.  The man is talentless 
 this book isn't so much as a 30 day plan as it is a collection of acne related studies summarized. yes, you learn a few interesting things, and he does back up his findings with scientific journals and experiments that have been conducted beforehand, but you could find all of this out on the internet. such things as milk, too much sweets, peanuts, and salt gives you acne but chocolate doesn't are what this book is about. But this is a bit contradicting in my opinion because doesn't milk-chocolate contain a bit of most if not all of these ingredients? An alright book if you want to know what to eat in a tidy small book, but if you have some extra time, type in "acne inducing foods" or something similar in a search engine and save some cash 
 I wont say anything about correctness, but in the end Ahmed Ali has been unable to convey the profound tone any of our holy books has, and definitely Kur'an does too.  The English is not in the least exciting or moving.. Finally the edition is a poor one, a uselessly big book, hard to handle when its paperback like mine. 
 	And lo' my children, the lord said unto thee that... wait a moment... this is the modern age why am I talking like a medieval preacher? Maybe that's because the profoundly stupefying effect that The Viccar of Wakefield by Oliver Goldsmith had on me.  	The story starts off in a monotone text voice and goes on like that for the entire one hundred ninety nine pages, give or take a few pages depending on version. The story follows a preacher and his family as they fall from grace into poverty. A merchant steals all the money that Viccar Primrose has invested, leaving them poor and forcing them to move out from their home in Wakefield. The book continues and follows the family's trials and tribulations. 	This book was extraordinarily hard to read, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not a college level English student, and even then only at your own risk. No words are in quotes, the fourth wall is broken constantly, and the main character just preaches what the author thinks about everything. It is probably one of the hardest books I have ever read, and I am a junior English major in college.  	The characters are amazingly flat, the plot has some redeeming qualities though. The plot shows how the people of the time lived, had fun, and loved; not to mention how mothers regarded their children. The ending though was so... contrived that it ruined whatever interest the main story had.  	All in all, this story was a waste of time. If you want to learn how things worked in that age, there are plenty of stories that are easier to read, much more accurate, and have less author interruption then this book. Its negatives greatly outweigh its positives, so unless you have to read it, stay away. 
 Being a student of photojournalizm in Moscow, Russia, I looked for the most complete book on photographic composition that is available. I had studied one book on the subject by the russian author, but knowing that photography in the US is much more developed and professional I was striving to get a book by a professional photographer.  I was disappointed by the book "Photographic Composition" by Tom Grill for a number of reasons:  1. It does not cover all important compositional elements, and those that it covers are not explained in full detail. It does not explain: - how elements with the similar shapes, similar sizes or similar tone interact with each other,  - the reverse perspective effect and its uses, - why right and left sides of the photograph differ and why, how it can be used on practice, - how to balance "weight" of different elements of the photograph, it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an incorrect example, - difference between compositional center and the center of interest, how to balance them if they are in different parts of the photo (does not match each other) - all signs of perspective, it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a clear sign of perspective (trivial as it may sound, it still should be marked in any complete work, especially when the author covers other three elements) - and much much more.  2. It does not use photographs of the best masters to illustrate the topic, neither does it show how composition works in art, which I believe is very important.  3. Most examples are in color, while most ideas on composition are best explained using B&W photographs.  4. Last but not least, composition is about meaning, making a message, not just how to balance different elements within a frame. The book makes this statement, but in my opinion fails to provide poverful examples, while you can fully appreciate the power of composition only by studying powerful photos with good explanation why precisely this photo is good.  OVERALL: I believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all important considerations, not just a few and briefly explained "how-to-quickly-improve-any-photo-you-take". This books fails to provide complete approach to composition and at times can be misleading.  I'd be very grateful if you could recommend me (and other folks that look at our reviews) a more thorough book on composition, I'm sure there must be a good book in english on that subject. Thanks!  P.S. For those who can read in russian I advise a book by A. Lapin "Fotografiya kak..", which compared to the book by Tom Grill explains composition in full 
 Perhaps listening to the audiotape intensified the smug, "aren't I hilarious?" tone of this book. Note: It is entirely possible that I am not clever enough to understand the humor of this book.  Or even to IDENTIFY the humor in the book.  The story of the two families competing with each other - to the point of handing over their children to be abused by a beggar, and donating various organs - was the train wreck of the Holiday tales.  (Although it may have been the story about the preacher, I can't say for sure because I gave that deadly tale five minutes to redeem itself before skipping it entirely.  So, in fact, perhaps the story is not about a preacher.  I'll never know.  Neither should you.)   I think it's fair to say that the self-satisfied, condescending narrator of these tales simply couldn't bring himself to care about his characters.  They're simply dimensionless, cliched props - the self-centered suburban woman, the socially competitive neighbors - that should immediately journey to Oz so that they can collect the hearts and brains of which Sedaris has seen fit to deprive them.    Speaking of hearts and brains, this book could use a hefty dose of those, too.  
 Michael Dirda, reviewer for the Washington Post, has called John Crowley probably the finest fantasy writer alive. Lord knows, he has written complex masterpieces, "Little, Big", the "Aegypt" series, "Engine Summer", "The Great Work of Time", etc, but some of his more recent works show a really disturbing unevenness in quality.  So why doesn't this wonderful author stop writing pot boilers like this and finish the last of the four book "Aegypt" series, arguably the finest written fantasy series ever?   Now THAT I strongly recommend 
 I enjoyed "Temple" but this book was just awful.  Reilly's books are full of amazing, improbable but fun action scenes.  You spend a few hours suspending common sense but having a good time.  In this book however there were two elements that were just so bad that they ruined the rest of the adventure.  1) The career Marine captain has a romance with an NCO who reports to him.    and 2)There was a bear family that played a key role in the story - mama bear, baby bear and papa bear.  Right.  The only place you will fine a papa bear in a bear family is in Goldylocks.  Read "Temple" instead 
 I wish I could give this movie zero stars. It's really amazing how someone can inject raw gore, violence, and sick humour into a movie, and try to pass it off as slick comedy, drama, and deep philosophy. This movie is a great example of how a director can actually make a deliberate and hard working effort to produce a despicable movie. The sheer perversity in this movie that is dressed up as comedy and paraded as some kind of dark humour is beyond criticism. Do yourself a favour and please don't ever watch this movie if it comes on air. It's not even worth watching for morbid fascination. I terribly resent the fact that I gave up an hour and a half of my life watching it out of sheer curiosity. But then, I may actually be glad that I did. At least it taught me how an exercise in atrocious film making can be 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 I hated this book.  It is vague and broad and won't tell you much you need to know.  The cute jokey style is a weak attempt to demystify when some insightful writing would serve much better.  
 It is unclear whether Tami was trying to write a cheap romance novel or an adventure story.  I was very disappointed in the book, since I had been hoping for a real, true-adventure story.  Most of this book seems to be trying to cater to the dimestore romance crowd and at times seems too perfect and too romantic, and when she mentions her "sculpted" shoulders, it was TOO much. I just couldn't get the feeling that this was really a non-fiction book, except near the end when she does reach land.  Then she seems to drop the "novelist" stuff and talk from the heart 
 I'm sorry but I must agree with others here that this was a very slow, confusing BORING book! I've heard about Linda Barnes and was told she's a good writer - not in this book! I think maybe it could have possibly been better by cutting at least 100 pages! (Yes, I put all those extra words in on purpose!) I really do NOT have to know every stupid detail about how she gets from point A to point B! Really! I haven't read (nor will I ever read) any of her previous books so the whole thread with her Little Sister was confusing and ... no necessary. I only gave the book two stars for a great premise. Too bad it was wasted

 This is the kind of art that show me the power of fiction over reality. Why did he use those sizes? Wow! Did you see them? I do have fantasies but come on! Let's get real. Real guys with real dimensions. No more no less,  that's the beauty of life 
 This is the sixth book in the Left Behind series. It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting. It did not flow as well as the others, so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening. The book also spends a lot of time re-telling what we read in previous books. I felt this time like I read half a novel.  The book starts in the thirty-eighth month into the tribulation. But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book. Allowing their own desires to guide their actions. Whether that desire be derived from rage, revenge, self pity, or even guilt. Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ. Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures. And when the time comes for the assassination, there are a few characters to chose from.   The book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti-Christ. Stay tuned for the next volume. I have read this far, so I will finish the series. Though most people my find this book suspensful, I did not 
 In an era of Batman Begins, Sin City, Spiderman, and 300, it's easy to forget that there was a time when a movie based on a comic book wasn't a sure thing.  For an example of a spectacular misfire, Spawn comes to mind; the movie was so obsessed with making the film look like a comic book that it actually FELT like you were watching a comic book, complete with isolated panels, minimal movement, and jarring transitions between scenes.  One moment Spawn's threatening some guy and the next he's standing on some building with his really fabulous cloak whipping in the wind.  Similarly, Superman is a visually beautiful movie that has nowhere to go.  The iconic scenes of Superman basking in the sun's rays, or hovering about the Earth listening for crime, or when he's actually doing something heroic (which happens far too infrequently) fail to cover up the complete lack of a coherent plot.  For example:  Superman's been gone for years...one assumes that whatever he discovered on his long journey would have something to do with the plot.  Nope.  Lex Luthor has discovered Superman's Fortress of Solitude and plans to create an entire continent out of a hybridized Kryptonite.  Surely that means Superman won't even be able to get NEAR the place, right?  Nope.  Once said "continent" shows up, it's clear that the whole thing is patently uninhabitable.  This is Lex's big plan, to create a rock formation and play cards while he waits for...people to call him and offer him money or something?  Surely he must have more up his sleeve? Nope.  Heck, the world's changed a lot since Superman's been gone, right?  Wouldn't it make sense to really pound home how different Earth is, with it's global warming, crazy politics, and pop starlets?  Nope.  Instead, the crazy new world is supposed to be summed up with a kid taking a picture of Superman with his cell phone--that's right, the kid scooped the Daily Planet with just his camera phone! ISN'T THAT WACKY?  Superman Returns is very much a movie in love with the original and, while visually faithful, it's a very poor imitation.  Yes, Brandon Routh looks like a spitting image of Christopher Reeves, but he has no real acting chops to display since he barely speaks.  Kate Bosworth is far too young and whiny as Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington) still wears a bowtie for some reason, and the rest of the cast is too caught up in being iconic comic book characters to be memorable.  Even the amazing Kevin Spacey can only be a marginally cartoonish Lex Luthor, jarringly transforming into a murderous thug at the movie's climax.  The pacing is all wrong.  Superman saving Lois from a plane crash is great.  Superman fighting criminals with belt-fed chain guns is excellent.  Superman drowning, Superman moping, Superman frustrated over Lois Lane, Superman convalescing in a friggin' hospital?  NOT GREAT.  Superman Returns has its moments, and if you squint your eyes it almost feels like the magic from the first movie has been captured.  But then it's gone and the movie drags, and drags, and drags.  Superman has been co-opted to be a Christ-like father-son parable and on the way Bryan Singer forgot what made the first Superman movie so great: it was FUN!  I could have made a better movie with my camera phone. 
 Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for "A Walk in the Woods" or "A Short History of Nearly Everything 
 Men actually leave their yards and talk to one another.  Children lie to each other about who does and who does not know how babies are made.  Women spy on the house of another woman they don't much care for.  And perhaps most shocking of all, Mrs. Carpenter sits in a chair that she purchased with no intention of sitting in.  It sounds like suburbia to me.  But in Alice McDermott's That Night, these actions are highly transgressive acts that violate the limits of the characters' previously circumscribed roles in the neighborhood.  For men, that means not leaving your yard and barely saying hello to anyone.  For women, the role is that of the stay-at-home gossip, fantasizing about widowhood and asking, about Sheryl's mother Ann:  "What can you do for a woman like that?"  What cataclysmic event incited these changes?  A boyfriend wants to talk to his girlfriend.  He and his friends confront her mother.  Violence ensues, jarring the denizens of this neighborhood out of their own despair over the "difficult, enduring stuff of daily life," (36) and for a while, the community is transformed.  Soon enough though, men go back to barely acknowledging each other, and "that night" becomes little more than a touchstone for the neighborhood gossip.  This is suburbia according to McDermott:  a tragedy happens in the lives of people you barely know, and at first glance it appears that the neighbors are rallying around the sufferers, when in fact, suburbanites need the pain of others to distract them from their own voids, and get a secondary benefit of always having something to talk about. 	Our source of information about "that night," (a phrase invoked throughout the work to the point of heavy-handedness) the narrator, informs us "even children know you cannot separate the tale from the teller." (157) While this maxim seems self-evident when one is reading works such as  The Catcher in the Rye, The Great Gatsby, or the more recent, Middlesex, it certainly gave me pause when I read it in That Night.  What are we to make of this statement, when McDermott does not let the narrator be known by us?  Clues are sprinkled throughout as to what this person has been up to since "that night," but they don't add up to a character I can put my trust in, essential in a work where the narrator is the empathic vessel through which the reader witnesses all of the events of and surrounding "that night."  She tells us about Sheryl's relationship with Rick; she tells us about Sheryl's experience in Ohio, and she is absent from both scenarios, as well as many others she also tells us about.  This "ability" of the narrator to report on events that she did not attend led me to wonder whether or not as an adult she was imagining/inventing an entire sweeping context for a traumatic event she witnessed one evening during her childhood.  Continuously, I asked myself:  how would the narrator know this?  I understand that sometimes the reader must accept the conventions that a novelist employs, but I felt here plausibility is under too much of a strain.   Eugenides avoids this trap in Middlesex by engaging us with a narrator we know a lot about - we know who Cal is, what he would or would not say, how he would act in a given situation - and by making him essential to the action of the story.  McDermott doesn't even give her narrator a name.  And yet, at the end of the book, much attention is paid to the demise of her marriage, and the selling of her parents' house.  I found this to be a very curious choice on McDermott's part:  why develop her character in the last chapter of the book when there was so little development before this point?  Then I got to page 164, when the narrator talks to Rick, now a defeated man, who has come to look at her parents' house.  She "asked him, `Do you know why she [Sheryl] moved away?' There was a coy hint of gossip in my voice...." The narrator is happy and quick to open old wounds for Rick.  Whoever the little girl was that witnessed "that night," she has become one of the adults around her at the time, a person obsessed with one small event emblematic of the misery of other people.  Sounds like a suburbanite to me. 
 This is the first Elliott Kalb book I've read and I'm extremely disappointed with the numerous errors that pepper this book throughout.  Younger readers who are trying to learn something about the greats of the game will be inundated with incorrect or contradicting information and readers who consider themselves somewhat educated about baseball history will soon become annoyed at the mistakes, which seem to adorn every single page.  Kalb states in one player's comments that the first All-Star game took place in 1934 (incorrect), then in another player's comments writes that the first All-Star game was played in 1933 (correct).  Confusing, no?  This is one of many examples that I found.    It appeared that some errors were the result of just plain laziness, while others came from poor research.  In the Mike Schmidt chapter, Kalb writes: "In 1977, he (Schmidt) scored 114 runs on his .274 batting average.  That's the record for most runs scored on a sub-.280 average in baseball history."  Not only is that NOT the record, it's not even close.  The record is held by Hub Collins, who scored 148 runs while hitting .278 in 1890.  In fact, there have been 73 times in baseball history that a batter scored at least 114 runs while hitting below .280.  And if you ignore the 19th century and only consider modern-day (1900-present) players, Red Rolfe holds the record with 143 runs scored on a .276 average in 1937.  The feat has been accomplished 36 times since 1900 and Schmidt is tied for 32nd (and last) place.  This may be nitpicking, but it's errors like this that make me not take this book seriously.  My second point of contention is that Kalb rarely "sells" his opinions why he thinks one player is better than another.  He states facts (sometimes even correctly), and compares the numbers and contributions of each man, then leaves most of the job to the reader to decide who was better.  But I bought the book hoping that "Mr. Stats" could convince me why one player should be considered better than another or perhaps change my mind about some of my own opinions.  Instead he came on with all the  conviction of a wet noodle.  I'm not going to bash Kalb for his rankings because, frankly, they're based on his opinions and he's entitled to them.  Just because I may disagree doesn't make him wrong and me right.  But his infatuation with Barry Bonds and insistance on bringing up his name every chance he could, became overbearing at times.  We get it, Mr. Kalb.  You think Barry Bonds is the greatest player of all time.  It's bad enough that I had to read about it  on the first page, let alone be constantly reminded of it on every other page.    As you can tell by now, I wasn't impressed with the book at all and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.  It wasn't particularly well written and there are too many errors and inaccuracies to receive my endorsement.           
 Samuel Epstein's book reads like a dull novel. I don't take him seriously, and neither does the scientific community.  If you want the facts, seek information from reputable sources. The safety of milk from cows treated with rBGH has been affirmed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), World Health Organization (WHO), American Medical Association (AMA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), American Dietetic Association (ADA) and regulatory agencies in 30 countries.  Milk is good for you.  Keep drinking it!! 
 This is definately classified as untalented chick-lit. I dont mind reading any chick-lit if it actually is meaningful and interesting. This book by the famous actor Steve Martin was terrible. This shows how poor his writing style could be.   This Novella is about a woman named Mirabelle she works at a glove-compartment store in New York City and she has dreams of becoming an artist. All this book revolves around is her love triangle between the wealthy-businessman Ray Porter-who is a classified as a player and the junkie Jeremy. All it centers around is her love-life and how she gets over it-how original. I read this in one day on a plane ride to Detroit and I got so bored with it. Its amazing to see how stupid this book is.  I dont really know how Steve Martin got away with writing this book, just because he's famous he can get a writing deal, its not worthing even borrowing from a library, there's nothing to it 
 I though that the book, The End of Physics was too much like a skeptical newspaper article, and not enough scientific interest.  The book was hardly informative, and much too pesimistic.  I can't even give the book away 
 I rather like the studio efforts that SCI has put out, however this record just bores me. The songwriting is very simplistic and I find it very hard to listen to the album all the way through. There are a couple of times that the songs seem to be about to go somewhere, but they just end. I'm not talking about ten minute jams, but just some sort of memorable hook or melody.   This album will turn a number of songs into live anthems, maybe, but then again, most Cheese songs translate live much better than on record. I gave this two stars for a Cheese record, though nothing on here is actually bad, just unassuming. If you are new to SCI, you should probably start somewhere else. If you are an old fan, then save your money for a concert 
 Want my book?  It is useless.  This book is full of information, none of it practical.  You can't find ANYTHING you are looking for in it.  NO hostels are listed.  They don't even highlight any of the amazing festivals that are held here in Mexico.  Believe me, I am living here in Mexcio, and I am going to go buy the Lonely Planet.  I wanted something more specific to my region, but this is NOT it.  This book is written like the author took one pathway through the region, and wrote along the way.  So unless you are following the exact same route, the information is SO useless 
 . . .uninspired and unsatisying. The writing style is Austinesque, but the insipid plot and shallow character development are definetly not. Margaret's motives and emotions are obscure, and the author's assertion that her "heroine" has wit and intelligence is never illustrated by word or deed. Quite the contrary . .  
 The first time my daughter played with this book she bit a hole in the plastic which covers the snail.  The thin plastic -- akin to saran wrap -- came off with a little pulling.  I think it presents a serious choking hazard; I am returning the book. 
 Mike Evens has done a good job of describing the very real and existing threat posed by Iran and radical Islam that is hell-bent on world domination. We do well to give careful heed to his warning. If we somehow doubt the content of this book we need only look at the news coming out almost daily, in the proclaimations and threats spoken by Ahmadbinejad himself. The contents of Mikes book are no secret. I strongly recomend this book to all who love the truth. I have bought several copies and am giving them away. Yes sir Mike, you have hit the nail on the head with this book and it could not be coming out at a better time. 
 I had to cancle the order, because I keeped getting notes that it was on back order when I order it I was told it would be ship in 2 to 4 day 
 I gave this the first star simply because it is a book about football.  The second star is because it does have interesting history about the NFL Draft and you do get a close look at how an NFL team evaluates a draft class.  Over a hundred pages of this book are absolutey WASTED on SCUMBAG AGENTS!!!  I do not, nor does any person with a conscience or decency, want to read anything that profiles and glorifies these money hungry crooked wastes of life that help to ruin professional sports.  If you do decide to get this book, skip chapters 4-8 as they deal mainly with agents.  The rest of the book is interesting and for that matter deserves a look 
 Atrocious (adjective): Very Bad, appallingly bad. So as ugly in taste or appearance as to elicit revulsion. Waste (Noun): a failure to use something wisely, properly, fully or to good effect.  These are the only words that truly describe what it is to watch Population 436. Those two words can tell you what the acting, writing, sets, and story were like. Jeremy Sisto I will forgive you this indiscretion, but just this once.  
 Vogue Knitting does not have customer service, strange as it sounds. I've bought subscription through Amazon and received 1 issue; I since moved to another state and all my magazines followed me except Vogue Knitting. All pleas, e-mails and other attempts to communicate with magazine failed - its been over 6 months and 2 missing issues and I still dont have my magazine; probably won't. On the other hand, why would Vogue Knitting worry about lonely subscriber whose money they long spent 
 Online documentation has its place, but I like books better for learning. I found Eclipse's online doc especially lacking when it comes to *learning* about this complex product. Sure there's a ton of stuff, but most of it just seems to describe the ten's of thousands of options that the tool provides. (Personal Rant: Do we really need all of these options? Can't anyone see that just because you can do something doesn't mean you always should? Can't anyone see that a lot of these options just get in the way of using the product?) There, I feel better now. So when it came time to learn about Eclipse I reached for a book. I can recommend this book because it is good but I can't recommend it because it is getting  dated. And that's just the nature of the beast when you write a book about a product as opposed to a technology. (The latter also gets out of date, but not as quickly. Maybe it's because there are less screen shots of actual components.) For the most part the screen shots of the dialogs and menus are still useful, i.e. even though the product's UI has changed you can still easily go from the book to the component you are looking at on the screen. But... well, here are the versions of various products covered in the book versus the versions of these products today: Eclipse 2.1.1 vs. 3.1 Ant 1.5.3 vs. 1.6.5 Tomcat 4.1.29 vs. 5.5 Struts 1.1 vs. 1.2.7 Another thing I did not like: they used "poor programming practices" in their chapters on JSPs and servlets. For example, in JSPs they used scriptlets and in servlets they output a bunch of HTML. I don't like it when a book does stuff "we're not supposed to do anymore. 
 I enjoyed the book but the author's errors occurred in areas that I'm very unforgiving of.  In one place he mistakes semi-automatic firearms for fully-automatic firearms.  Even if the author doesn't feel obligated to do much research for light fiction like this, the editor should have caught something so blatantly wrong.    I enjoyed some of the ridiculous characters that always show up in his books.  But, like Stephen King, I'm beginning to notice that he has certain characters that he uses again and again.  The hermit in the woods that knows everything.  State troopers are always perfect and dedicated but feds and city cops are dummies.  Throw in a scene that involves a complicated sexual position.  It just seems a bit lazy.  I know it's light fiction, but I like a bit more flesh to my beach reading.  I should mention that I didn't actually "read" this book, I listened to the unabridged audio version 
 We are pregnant and our baby is due in two weeks.  We bought the mattress for our Delta Marisa White Crib, and (you guessed it) it doesn't fit.  I read the review of another poster here and it says it doesn't fit their Thomas The Tank Engine toddler bed. The poster assumed that it may fit a baby's crib, but the honest truth; its one inch (possibly more) off.  An inch is enough for our baby's foot to get stuck in it, and the mattress feels like a joke, its too cushiony.  We regret not reading the reviews before buying it.  If this mattress doesn't fit the majority of cribs/beds, then what is it good for 
 Having read both _The Revolt of the Elites_ recently and _The Revolt of the Masses_ several times, I am struck by previous reviewers contrasts and apparent misreadings. Ortega y Gasset argues a larger, archetypal predicament, that the supposed elites are plagued with the same lowest common denominator, mass or canned thought as everyone else is.  Ortega y Gasset is writing with a slightly larger scope than Lasch and I would propose that Lasch misreads Ortega y Gasset himself and fails in his analysis. Purported 'Elites' are not an agreed upon monolith, and ostensibly those advancing the thought of Leo Strauss or, antipodally, Louis Althusser can be construed as elites. Therefore, one must respond with the criticism to Lasch of which elites are railroading democracy. I find this a simplistic indictment and far less invigorating than his excellent "The Culture of Narcissism". 
 I'm very disappointed with the results. I am fairly young, 31. I have very fine lines and i thought this would make them disappear. It really didn't do anything to my skin. Plus it is greasy and has an unpleasant smell. I do not recommend this 
 In a word: BORING!  This book would have been twice as good were it half as long. Selbourne has cut the end and would have done well to cut the middle as well. Jacob's incessant protestations of piety are tedious. He hypocritically condemns everyone around him for greed and self-interest but his own actions, though ostensibly high-minded, are also dictated almost solely by financial motives. For this reason his criticism of others rings hollow. His world view is remarkably narrow and parochial for someone so widely traveled. While he makes extensive observations of the conduct of others, there is no effort to appreciate their viewpoints. I am also skeptical of the provenance of this book. The social debates described have a very contemporary tenor and are relevant to our own times. If this were in fact an authenticated manuscript, this resonance would be remarkable. However, the provenance of the book is in dispute and much space is devoted to supporting its authenticity. The resolution of this issue must await examination of the original manuscript but in the meantime I am skeptical because the discussions seem too modern 
 The most unfortunate thing about this book is that you should have read Pratchett's other novels to catch some jokes about Rincewind, the wizards and other characters. My intention was to introduce a friend to Terry Pratchett's hilarious writing and was not able to use this book for that reason. I would probably have to use some other book, may be "Moving Pictures".   Apart from that, this book is only moderately funny and Pratchett resorts to some cheap puns here and there, which I found disappointing. This is a novel that seems like Pratchett wrote at the insistence of the publishers, but did not really have the energy to. 
 I bought this for my sister when she told me she was going to have a commitment ceremony.  I was honored when she asked me to be her Maid of Honor.  The book isn't bad or anything but it could use some updating.  My sister said only some of the information was helpful to her.  There aren't many books on the market for this topic though.  So if you can't find anythign else it's worth buying 
 Product came DOA - software wouldn't load.  Called technical support who 3 times said they would email the download, but their English wasn't good enough to get my email address correct - even after spelling several times.  Called Kensington Corporate in California and spoke to Customer Service Manager who said someone would call me shortly.  Called Customer Service Manager back 24 hours later and he noted it wasn't his fault no one contacted me, as he passed on the information.  I'm returning this after investing hours unsuccessfully trying to overcome the Kensington Customer Service Prevention Department.    
 The one battle where the Americans managed to win properly against an out-numbered British force of regulars. Tarleton was a fantastic soldier and cavalry officer but he certainly was not a General. Had Cornwallis or Clinton been there the battle would have been different. It's amazing how a book has been written on this ONE battle. Perhaps an American author might like to write seperate books on the The Battle of Savannah? Maybe Germantown? Or even *shock* Camden? All decisive British victories with massive American casualties.  It's interesting to note that Daniel Morgan told his troops that they must on no account cross bayonets with British redcoats at Cowpens. Only goes to prove the melee superiority of British soldiers over US soldiers.  Tarleton has his revenge not long after this battle though at Torrance's Tavern where he taunted his dragoons to remember Cowpens. 300 Continental Dragoons, Infantry and Militia were massacred in the ensuing Melee 
 The book had an impact on me. It did, for instance, tinker with my idea of what dating should be (or shoudl be like). But the book is like a dogmatic pile of rules that people should abide by. And worse still, the book is interwoven with scripture to make it sound like the Bible says such and such about dating, instead of Joshua Harris.   I know that his heart is in helping people grow in their relationships, but this book is written from a perspective high up on an alter of self-righteousness - and down below, the rest of the world, broken and depraved. I mean, as a student (and now I am a teacher), I have sat through many college courses where professors talk about the ideal of education - every child can learn, every parent cares, and every child comes with some innate bundle of intelligence. But the real classroom is nothing like this. When Harris talks about asking the father of the girl you are about to date for her hand in courtship, or when he discusses going to his father for advise or for his pastor for guidance, I think he is talking about an ideal that few people actually have access to. Should they? Perhaps. But this book is written in such a manner that says that unless you do this, then it is highly improbable that your relationship can survive - or better yet, be as good as his. 
 This program is good if you want to mold the matrix bit by bit. But if you want to make games in a snap, spring for the professional and get a level editor on a DarkBASIC website 
 There are NO English Subtitles as it says there are in the DVD Features. I would think subtitles would be a pretty standard feature in DVD movies these days - Artisan Entertainment is just lazy I guess...    
 I was quite disappointed with this one.  First of all the book's ending is very grim.  I agree with another reviewer when they said they'd rather be left imagining what kind of messes Arthur and Ford were getting themselves into now.  And so many unanswered questions!  What happened to Fenchurch and why didn't Arthur care more about what happened to her?  What happened to Zaphod?  Colin the robot?  What is the question to the answer 42?  What was Fenchurch's idea that would solve the world's problems?  What was the point to the people on Rupert?  It's worth reading just to be able to finish off the series and because it's still well written and funny just like the others.  But be prepared to be disappointed by the loose ends and finale.  
 David Mamet let me down with this film -- even though I picked this DVD up for $2 at my workplace's DVD library sale, I felt rather ripped off after I watched the movie. From the very first scene, I began to realize that this was not going to be an 'intelligent, gripping political thriller,' but a rather hastily made B-movie that charades as something worth watching.   The depictions of secret agents, of soldiers, of political schemers were all the stereotypical (and pretty much ridiculously contrived) cutout figures for crappy action movies throughout time. The political 'thrill' is cut short by the quick injection of 'action' scenes; however, these action usually amount to about three muffled gunshots and a brief spray of blood. I don't demand flashy effects from all movies, but if you have to resort to these kinds of scenes to rejuvenate your bored audience, for God's sake, make them ACTION scenes. Don't just throw in some tinny pistol reports for effect whenever you think 50% of the audience has fallen asleep.   The plot meanders through various recycled action locations -- the seedy bar, the rural gas station, the mysterious house, the dangerous foreign lair... but nothing really interesting or stirring happens. Minor protagonists die, but you don't really ask why or even think about it after the scene changes, because you already saw it coming half an hour before it actually happened. 'Bad Guys' die without being established as bad guys... they're just there, and Val shoots them or stabs them, and they die, and then you forget about them.   A lack of any real plot drive, bad scripting (including some of the worst one-liners ever), mediocre cinematography, a limp musical score, a highly predictable sequence of events and locations, and an overall feel of hokey 'we made this as quick as we could so we wouldn't have to think about how awful this project really was' compel me to rate this movie 2 stars 
 I read this book and I think presented material is not practical in commercial applications. In my opinion better solution is writting tests and using aspects to integrate applications. I know this is something different from contracts, by I think contracts are to complex, hard to maintain and lacks of support for multithreaded problems.   For me another problem with contracts is problem in describing complex constraint that exists in problem domain. For example how to describe that objects must be cloned, not passed by reference or how to check that objects holded by readonly list not change their state during operations on list?

 I love Dr. Seuss, and enjoy reading most of his stories to my 1.5 year old son.  But this book is surprisingly bland.  The illustrations are pitiful, and done mostly in browns.  The story doesn't hold my son's (or my) interest past the first 6 or so pages.  If I'd known this, I would've skipped this book and opted for a more classic Dr. Seuss, such as Green Eggs & Ham 
 Year of the Spider rocked, the whole album was awesome. This new album just doesn't cut it on any front. The lyrics are bad, there is no melody, there is no rhythm, and no power. It was extremely disappointing. After this album, I wonder if I want to hear any more of their stuff. This album was like another band or something... I wish it were better. They can be great if they want to 
 This book did not work for me. I believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship. In this book, the author, rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves, presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex. Personally, I'm not looking to 'trick' anyone into going out with me or fall in love. How I open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as I'm walking around after I've opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play 'the game' properly. I don't feel that it's a game. It's about being true to ourselves. It's about relating - being best friends. And we are not peacocks - displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time. We are empowered with language. I'm more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as Gray does. Authors that I recommend are Charlotte Kasl, John Welwood and John Stoltenberg. Good luck! 
 This book has grotesque errors throughout, including in the practice tests.  On practice test 1, section 4, problem #8, the numbers are vastly different from test to answer key.  On the same practice test, same section, the answer to problem #14 is also incorrect (3 3/4 equals 15/4, not 13/4).   On page 105 in the section entitled "The Arithmetic You Need to Know" Mr. Falletta explains what least common multiple is, then gives problems to complete "on your own - least common multiple", but the answers given are factors, not multiples.    We didn't even do anything other than math.  After finding the errors in practice test 1, I put the book away.  It wouldn't even be fair to re-sell it.  It's worthless if one can't trust the content to be accurate.  It is inexcusable to have such gross errors in a book like this.  It was clearly not well edited and perhaps hastily written.  A huge disappointment.    
 It took a few hours to learn how to download the latest firm ware for the router and n-draft adapter (both from d-link).  The wired connections worked great.    The wireless conections worked fine for the B (add-on D-link notebook adapter) and G (built-in adapter) laptops, but the other 2 laptops that had the N-draft adapters would not work.  One n-draft adapter was from dell in a brand-new 1505, the other n-draft adapter was from DLINK.   Scary that the dlink adapter would not connect to the dlink router.  Even with all of the security disabled, the N-draft adapters would not connect to the router.  With security enabled, and taking all of the right steps to set it up, nothing would connect to the router.  It refused to recognize the security key.  After being on hold for an hour, Dlink tried to help me.  They gave me about 20 minutes of support before dropping the call.  Basically, they gave up and said that I should return it.   Three weeks ago, I mailed the items to Amazon.  It was well within the 30 day window from the date of purchase.  I am still waiting for a refund.  Why does it take so long?    Obviously, I can not give this product a good review.  Between the headache of dlink, and the slow response for my refund, this has been a miserable experience.  Dell tech support recommends the Netgear N-draft router.  Once Amazon refunds me my money, that's what I'll buy 
 I agree 100% with Mr. Steven Epstein's review (February 7, 2000), about Dr America: The Lives of Thomas A Dooley 1927-1961 by James Fishe 
 This movie is so unbelievably horrible, I am pleading for you to rethink watching. I haven't seen something so bad, since, well, The Village. I would rather watch The Power Rangers than this movie. This movie, seriously, looks like it was filmed with my grandmother's video camera. Absolutely ridiculous...save yourself the time and mone 
 This is a very basic manual.  Especially good for those with little or no accounting or financial background 
 such a waste. read Jesus' Son instead--it's amazing. this...is...the dullest thing i have ever read. my book club hates me for it. they will all get Jesus' Son for xmas 
 This book is truly horrible in every possible way.  The book is extremely redundant (obviously to fill up pages in an effort to make a longer book out of minimal material), and is full of trivial and inconsequential information about Dr. Levine's young subjects.    Evidently, Levine is very pleased with his lame attempt at being an entertaining writer, but the truth is that this is the most poorly written book of any kind ever produced!  It is full of the most ridiculous examples of verbal circumlocution that I have ever witnessed.  These polysyllabic phrases alternate with other sections that are extremely provincial and that seem to often digress from the subject at hand.  Even though the author apparently has fairly extensive scientific training (Levine is an M.D., after all), this book is totally unscientific--full of personal antecdotes and conjecture, without  any references to scientific studies and without any comparisons to control groups or test subjects.  There is also no consideration given to the large number of variables that are affecting each of Levine's patients that he writes about here.  Basically, the book is simply a collection of euphemisms for describing laziness and other character weaknesses and flaws.  The labels that Levine uses, such as "mental energy dysfunction", "energy crisis", "low motor turnout",  "extreme social distractibility", and "active-working-memory dysfunction" are laughable.  What the poor young subjects written about in this book really need are parents, teachers and other adult mentors who actually care enough about them to have high expectations of them.  They need adults who are willing to make them behave, do their homework, go to bed on time, etc.  Having their negative characteristics simply given more flattering names is not going to help these poor young subjects one bit.  This book does have a catchy title (a good hook), but there are many other books that address the same subject that are so much better.  I could only recommend this book to those who suffer from extreme insomnia.  I guarantee that it WILL put you to sleep fast 
 I am interested in succint yet exhaustive/substantive coverage of the topic for use in real-world corporate finance applications.  I found the book to be verbose and not sufficiently to the point.  The author peppers a few key insights in endless dialogue, which I find a bit tiresome.  The text could be better organized to highlight key points and provide greater substance and less fluff.  Definition of terms could be far better written even for an introductory text.  I suspect I am the wrong target audience 
 The whole premise and ultimate execution of this tacky and ridiculous fictional story line was an exercise in frustration and dissapointment for this viewer.  In short, the disjointed story line goes like this: troubled angst-ridden teen sees a person in a scary looking imaginary bunny suit (whose face resembled Iron Maiden's Eddie!) who gives him advice/messages; he escapes death (a jet engine crashing through his roof) because he listened to this fugly bunny and left his house; he gets instructions to conduct vandalism against those places and people he dislikes from said stuffed bunny; he discovers some old hag named Roberta Sparrow he knew was an ex. teacher at his high school who wrote a terrible version of a 'Hitchikers guide to time travel and worm holes'; same falling jet engine he escaped the first time around finally falls from the sky and kills him, but his girlfriend who died gets 'resurrected'.  Are you still with me??!!!  I love sci-fi and fiction, but all this is beyond ridiculous!  That, my friends, is essentially what this super cheesy 'made for mallrat teens' film is about!  I mean, 'Gigli' was a better film for chrissakes!  Even the made-up time travel rules and tenets from the various chapters of this stupid time travel book that they flashed onscreen from time to time was laughable.  In the end, the ONLY redeeming moments in the movie was when they used some great songs in the soundtrack from great alternative timeless rock bands like The Church, Duran Duran, Joy Division, and Tears For Fears.  Hardly enough to save the film though.  If you must, rent 'DD' if your curiosity is piqued, but to pay full retail for this movie is a certain waste of your (or your parents') money 
 this book's content was good enough, but it was writen rather sloppily and with no read order, that i could see anyway.  the author attempts to lose us by using hard-to-follow words and phrases 
 The book's strong points are its detailed maps and illustrations,but it suffers from an unconvincing analysis of Alexander's motives,plans and their results.Dodge has a tendency to take many things at face value and is  a modern day victim of Alexander's own propaganda campaign.this is clearly  seen in Dodge's failure to implicate Alexander in the assassination of his  father Phillip despite overwhelming evidence,his lack of understanding of  Alexander's long political struggle against Parmenio's clan for dominance  over the army[motive enough for their eventual purge] and of Alexander's  shaky relations with the  subjugated Greek citystates.Even Dodge's analysis   of the key battles of Granicus and Chaeronaea and the siege of Thebes are  suspect.As for the most readable part of the book, the narrative of  Alexander's conquest,credit is better given to Arrian's primary text.For a  far more interesting and convincing look into a man as brilliant and  complex as Alexander I would reccomend Peter Green's 'Alexander of  Macedon', Fuller's 'Generalship of Alexander ' and Arrian's 'Campaigns of  Alexander' 
 This is only for people who don't want to take the time to listen to Dylan's Cd's form this peiod. Buy the book's about the Rolling Thunder & Gospel years.This DVD will leave you wishing you spent your money on something better 
 I can only give you my perspective.  To me, this book's sole chance to claim some value would be if it were able to serve as a "cautionary tale," or self-help parable, to be read and acted upon by the type of people described therein. What type of people are these, you ask? They are a hetero couple: American, white, middle-aged, middle-class, suburban, bored, self-absorbed, superficial, incurious, calculating, and inept in the roles they find for themselves in their NYC-area suburban neighborhood (housekeeping, cooking, parenting, economical suburban husbandry, and so on). They are also habitual liars.   Their twin personality poles--emptiness and selfishness--create a working space within which the author is able to make many dark jokes, some of which are funny. Yes, they represent in allegorical fashion the political, cultural, architectural and human emptiness and selfishness of the American suburbs.  Just as there is not enough there there in the suburbs, as human beings Elaine and Paul lack any sort of substantial personal core, or home. Their clumsy attempt to burn down their house at the open is the clumsy, overwrought symbol which informs the rest of the story.  To me "Music for Torching" has no literary value, zero--there is no poetry here. There is a kind of selective transcription and distillation of the thought and words of suburban family life, with omissions of gesture, tone of voice, etc. used to create a sense of loopy, malevolent derangement, and impending doom.  There are isolated photo-like bursts of sociological and psychological penetration, with clever formulations and associations, and surreal sitcom-like riffs. I'm not saying what A.M. Homes has done is easy to do--it's not. But then neither, say, is writing a critical anthropological study of privileged white people in Westchester. That would have been better.  Up to a point, Homes does a good job depicting the American demand for "authentic" experience. Unless they are--with each new moment--surprised, excited and delighted, reassured and loved, Elaine and Paul don't know what to do with themselves. Their inner mental monologues are a hash of confusion, insecurity, folly.  The author shouts via bullhorn, when the asthma inhaler comes out, that she (or Elaine and Paul) will be killing off one or both children. The tragic conclusion is probably the safest and least inspired moment of the book. But people like Paul and Elaine don't get their come-uppance by losing a child. Statistically such children are pampered, loved and maintained like no other children in human history.  Instead, American suburban selfishness and emptiness redound to boring things like: enormous national debt, destruction of wildlife habitat, sweatshops, bad air quality, rising cancer rates, festering racism, and horrible political leaders who decide to kill many people in other countries. That's where you will find the _actual_ end of this tragedy.   More likely is that Sammy and Daniel grow up selfish and empty, go to school to learn to exploit something, and then, in the year 2050, find their world rocked when the exploitees bite them on the ass.  If you want your satirical portrayal of white suburban American childish greed and folly straight up, I'd recommend "The Depressed Person," by David Foster Wallace. If you want a story about the mistakes of parents echoing to the destruction of a child, take a look at David Foster Wallace's fully human "Incarnations of Burned Children," from _Oblivion_. Let the astounding ending of this one serve as antidote to A.M. Homes' tacked-on ending 
 I bought this book expecting a long overdue treatment on one of the most dramatic camapigns of the War between the States. Instead what I got was socio-political fluff that quite frankly has been beat over the heads of tens of thousands of college students for over fifty years. Hence the two star rating. It was, however, well written and the battle narrative (the miniscule one provided by Rable) is actually very good, just far too short for a book claiming to be written about the Fredericksburg campaign and battle. Had this not been stocked in the military history section, it would actually pass as great socio-political history. But since many of us have zero interest in that category... well anyway. "New" Military history is quite frankly an attempt to liberalize and propagandize the last bastion of history we have, military history. If all future War between the States and WWII and Napoleonic and Roman military history books turn out this way... just buy the old classics and re-read them. Don't waste your money on New Mil Hist and certainly don't waste your money on this book. It takes the dead horse of Emancipation Proclomation and beats it to past death into carcass mutilation. Again, this book was supposed to be about Fredericksburg Mr. Rable, not the cause of the war to begin with which by the way unfair taxation and import tarrif laws not slavery. Alas, a different subject for a different time.  I repeat... DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Buy O'Reilleys instead. 
 I was excited as I flipped through the pages of this cookbook -- many of the recipes sounded tantalizing, and all the color photos displayed tasty looking dishes.  HOWEVER, after trying out my first recipe (the curried tempeh and grains), both myself and my dining companion were rather let down.  We found the dish incredibly bland and not at all what we had expected.  Despite the dissatisfying first attempt, I didn't let that deter me from trying again.  Surely the Thai-Inspired Broccoli w/Coconut Sauce could not fail....  Well, it did.  Again, neither of us clamored for seconds, as the dish lacked any real flavor or punch one would expect of something inspired by Thai food.  Again and again, this cookbook failed to satisfy -- definitely not a keeper 
 I purchased the Peg Perego Aria stroller last month for my 3rd son.  Needless to say, I have lots of experience in the stroller world.  This was my first Peg Perego stroller purchase as I have used Graco and Maclaren in the past.  I had been using my Maclaren umbrella stroller (which I purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old) and thought I would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old.  My girlfriend recommended the Aria so I purchased it.  Anyways, it was a huge disappointment.  The steering is AWFUL.  You definately need TWO hands for this stroller.   The stroller is also extrememly "wobbly".  I was shocked as I figured such an "upscale" brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much.  The 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little "envelope" type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place.  It is bulky in that it doesn't fold into a small compact stroller.  I used this 3 times and just gave it away...what a waste of $$. I'm back to using my Maclaren, which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller.  I could kick myself for wasting the money.  My advice to you is TEST it out before you buy it!!!(don't rely on the name 
 Joanna Weaver, the author of "Having a Mary Spirit", also wrote "Having a Mary Heart in a Martha World."  She has a unique way of reaching out to women with total clarity.  She reveals her own struggles and we all can identify with what she has experienced. There is also a touch of humor throughout.        We all want to improve our lives, to grow closer to God.  This book is a great little manual for doing so.  I highly recommend it, as it will surely change your life.   
 This book is sloppy. There are over 350 recipes presented higgeldy piggeldy throughout...no pictures and many recipes start three quarters of the way through one page and extend to the next. Not only are you flipping from one page to the next, but you may read through a recipe a dozen times until you realize the authors have neglected to tell you what to do with those mushrooms you sliced 1/2 inch thick (as in Slow cooker lemon chicken page 285).  They obviously rushed through the publication of this book and decided to forego the details in favor of jumping on the slow cooking bandwagon.  While there are some great recipes, the book is too unweildy and too poorly laid out to find them.  Try another slow cooker book!  
 Gleick would like us to feel that everything, EVERYTHING is going faster. Ultimately, whetever you are doing now, it will happen faster tomorrow.  Sure, life is getting faster, but that's not the ultimate goal. People want to do MORE, they do not want to simply go faster.   To ignore the need for more is to miss the entire point of why we want to do some things faster: so that we have the leisure to do other things more slowly! I would like to finish my work faster so I have more time to cook a gourmet meal. I like to commute via bicycle so I can combine my workout and commute, but I certainly don't rush!  This book has a lot of anecdotal data, which is all very interesting, but doesn't amount to much. Some of the individual chapters give very detailed analysis of specific people or technologies, but Gleick never pulls it all together.  In short, interesting data, but not enough to support his position. And certainly not nearly enough to appease a skeptic 
 When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier.  I did not find that at all.  This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all "I'm writing to help others" book of caring and honesty.  Her husband must be one great guy!  I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years.  I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment 
 This book is dull, dull, dull. If you like reading about celebrities, you might, might enjoy reading this. Otherwise, you will wonder why this book ever got published. I don't think it comes even close to accomplishing what the author may have intended, namely that if well-known people can get fired and rebound, then so can the reader. In fact, those portrayed in the book have had such presumably astounding success since they were fired that it almost makes you HOPE you get fired, the sooner the better, so you can get on the fast track to wealth and fame.  If you get fired, this book won't help you get hired again. It really doesn't matter what these people in the book did with their lives after they were dissed by someone along the way. If you find yourself getting fired, you still have to do what you have to do to get on with your life. You can't live someone else's. And you definitely don't need a book to tell you that 
  Though well made, the movie is manipulative, really leaving more questions than answers. The narrator is extremely vague, -- "certain people" "they" among other euphemisms -- refuses to include other points of view, making it ipso facto propaganda, and plays more on the viewer's emotions than anything else... Part of it is a pro-illegal immigration manifesto. The actual phrasing of the Geneva Convention is manipulated too -- in the actual document, it says that only those who fight under a uniform are entitled to it's protections. The documentary claims that all people are, regarldess... Overall, it's basically a documentary with some a few valid points but overall just well-made propaganda 
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 A very misleading title -- certainly not "definitive" and it's not for all climbers. It's an okay book if you're only interested in sport climbing and bouldering. Not very useful for alpinists, ice climbers, ski mountaineers, peak baggers or just being in shape for occasional weekend rockclimbs. Be very careful with some of his advice if you're over 30 since it's mostly written for younger climbers who recover quickly. Now that "Self-Coached Climber" is out, this book is even less valuable 
 This book held a lot of good information as a reference volume, but it made for VERY dry reading.  It is overloaded with archealogical references, and sice it is written in order of topic and not region, it is very disjointed.  It is hard to follow the history, myths, and beliefs when they are spread out over several chapters.  I find that by the time I get to a second mention of a myth or regional story, I've forgotten what I read about it in a previous chapter!  It is especially not a good book for a beginner just trying to get an overview of older pagan traditions 
 This book of short vampire stories is BAD, BAD, and BAD. The books feels like it was put together in a matter of hours all in pursuit of the mighty dollar. The stories are meaningless, contrived, and a waste of the paper they were printed on. The ONLY REDEEMABLE story in the whole bunch was Angela Knight's Galahad. If she's smart, she'll turn that into a full story to add to her collection of Mageverse. Galahad's story was quite good. We actually read a plot that developed quickly and had a show-down between good and evil. It also explained how another of the three "unholy" grails was destroyed. I'm glad I bought the book simply for that particular story. Galahad deserves FIVE STARS but the book as a whole should simply be left out in the yard for the sun to destroy 
 I received this book as a Christmas gift because I was interested in the Laci/Connor Peterson case. I'll admit that although I followed the case for a good amount of time, I stopped paying attention to news coverage once I found out about Amber and Scott's relationship. The whole thing disgusted me so I stopped watching/reading the news. When I got this book I was thrilled because I figured it would be neat to hear Amber's side of the story.  This book goes into detail everything about Amber's life, before Scott came along, during, and after. Amber uses this book to defend herself from the media's attacks on her personal life. I find it disturbing that she makes herself out to be a good, Christian girl (mentioning it several times throughout the book) and yet she admits to doing pretty "anti-Christian" things. She also defends her relationship with Scott, claiming that the two of them were in love, although she also says that she knew that he lied to her about his relationship with Laci. She portrays herself as a victim in this case yet she contradicts herself in so many ways.   If you don't know much about the Laci Peterson case, I suggest you read this book. As a warning, however, I will let you know that after reading this book you will have a strong dislike for Amber. And she certainly brings it on herself 
 I was disappointed that this book beat out Donald Hall's for the price but then started to review it and bought it and love it. A valuable addition to any collection. ramp this up to a three star at leas 
 I have to say, this CD is pretty bad. The songs on it are just pointless chants and words that should never have been said. I am not a fan of censorship, so i do not think that this should be censored, but it is everyones own choice to buy this or not, and trust me, this rap group only lives off the controversy, not talent, so don't buy it 
 This movie is Bloodsport minus the entertaining parts. Better production value- much worse script. Much worse everything almost. So if you liked Bloodsport which even at its cheesiest was a classic entertaining martial arts flick and you wanted to see another version of it that sucks but has more scenery, well here you go! Enjoy 
 I found this book disgusting in more ways than one. Is Ms. Klum really targeting women who feel they need to re-vamp their bodies, images, sex lives, etc? In other words, the average, moderately insecure woman? Wow, it really makes me feel special to see PAGES AND PAGES--even the inside of the front and back sections--filled with images of an airbrushed, overworked Heidi Klum. How can anyone aspire to that virtually unreachable level (as if Ms. Klum is anyone special without her makeup artist and hair colorist)? Certainly not someone who is taking the time to read this book. If you're in the mood for getting your ego stomped on or for seeing Ms. Klum in a book riddled with soft porn, shovel up the eighteen bucks and ENJOY 
 I like the fact that you can save money with not having a tuner that you do not need.  The Monitor is light and was easy to hook up.  The picture, even not in high definition is great.  DVD's look great on the screen, although the picture in widescreen does not fill the screen as you would think it would.  That is the one downside to this otherwise great television. 
 Fascinating well researched subject matter but somewhat ruminative and tedious. I found that could skip through many pages and find that the same events were being described yet again 
 I can not stand this book. I can't even finish reading it. Kevin J Anderson can not write original Star Wars books at all. The only thing I have ever seen with his name on it that was entertaining was the Dark Lords of the Sith comic book. Everything he writes is unoriginal and lacking in story. He seems to have some obsession with Death Stars and world destroyers because all he seems to put in his books are those. Darksaber, Jedi Search, Dark Apprentice, Champions of the Force, heck even the IG-88 story he wrote for Tales of the Bounty Hunters had the Death Star tied in (IG-88 transfers himself into the Death Star...what the heck?) Seriously, this book is not worth it. Try Timothy Zahn or Michael Stackpole. At least they don't always use Death Stars. And while Zahn's last 3 books are based around Thrawn, the original Heir to the Empire, Dark Force Rising and The Last Command, when Thrawn first appeared, was not him dry humping the same concept over and over 
 Every day I drive long distances so I thought that getting this on CD would be worthwhile.  Unfortunately, the author narrates her book which I think is a big mistake.  She has a very distracting accent and reading style.  It doesn't help that she begins the first chapter by giving us a detailed description of the daily activities of her cat.  After tolerating about two and a half minutes of this, I skipped to the next track.  That was about 9/11.  I don't have any fear or anxieties about terrorism so I skipped to the next track.  The subject matter sounded interdesting but again, I just couldn't get past her accent.    I really think that unless authors are good speakers, they should leave the narrations to trained professionals. 
 I hated this book as much as any book I've ever finished.  It's poorly written, incredibly boring and largely devoid of what any modern reader would recognize as characterization.  Apparently this book has some sort of historical significance to American literature. That's all well and good, but it's still lousy reading 
 I dare any Christian to read  The Jesus Mysteries: Was the "Original Jesus" a Pagan God? by Timothy Freke and Peter Gandy  and look at the bible the same way....go ahead. Don't let your fellow believers scare you with talk of going to Hell by questioning the bible. Do you really believe that God would hurt you for examining the world that he created 
 I could only get through the first two chapters before I snorted with laughter.  It just seems very anti-French, which is slightly amusing and terrible at the same time.  Since I was amused, I gave it two stars instead of one.  I knew this book was bad news when I first saw it in a grocery store, but I was tempted anyway.  Oh well.  Ugh 
 Though her novel does offer an interesting take on the Thoreau's classic, it is shear hubris to believe she attains nearly the level of the subtlety or philosophical complexity of his work. She in vain attempts to impose a  sort of solipsistic notion which runs rampant  through her own weak  idealogy. The protagonist is a lonely lonely individual, perhaps it is a  reflection of the author's apparent lonliness, hence the story goes from  being moving to pathetic.  Thoreau was attaining trascendental escape  through solitude, our author ohh...excuse me protagonist has no other  option except to be lonely, she has fallen into this state through her own  lack of social adeptness.  This lack of adeptness however is extremely well  written, which can only lead me to conclude that our author also lacks  social adeptness.  It seems that if the protagonist was placed in social  environment, her  self-delusions of her intelligence would be so blatant  and transparent that every word she would utter would drip with  condescending venom.   Clearly, the protagonist is an unkown woman, it  seems however the author is happy about such a state and I would imagine in  her own life she desires anonymity, unfortunately in our highly  "connected" world such an attidude leads to confrontation, and  her feeble attempt to escape is only met with derision from this reader

 This book is well written but adds nothing to the discussions around Outsourcing and the impact Globalization has had on the U.S. Economy.  Not recommended for serious readers familiar with the issues 
 As a Christian with Jewish friends, I read the book hoping to learn more about the "life-centered" aspects of Judaism.  The title drew me in. However, I found the book very offensive to Christians. Granted, the rabbi is writing about Judaism, but the "slams" against Christianity--as others have put it so well--have no place in the book.  Kushner admits that some Jews believe this, others believe that, but his attitude seems to be that all Jews are very observant. I gather that Judaism is based on actions and, the rabbi thinks, that Christianity is based on faith alone. Devout Christians pray morning, noon, night and compline; read devotional texts based on scripture--both Hebrew Bible and New Testament; read special materials during the long period of repentance and reflecton we call Lent--not just a week or 10 days, but 40 days not counting Sundays; although we must repent each day and pray for forgiveness, and certainly do so each week in church, Lent calls us to 40 days of prayer, fasting and other disciplines--but it isn't supposed to be on display.  Jesus opposed that;  we hold a three-hour vigil on Passion Friday; say grace before meals and sometimes after. Our religion stresses the need to repent our sins, ask God for forgiveness (no "pagan" elements, thank you, Rabbi; just the One God). Do good works, be charitable. We have two to seven sacraments, dependng on the church, and many Holy Days, of which Easter is the holiest.  Much of what Jesus taught is very similar to what Hillel and others taught. Kushner says Christians need Jews to remind us that there is more to religion than faith (something like that). We get it. And that Jews need Christians to remind them to share what is so great about Judaism ... except that if Judaism had spread widely, he said, it wouldn't be Judaism because it's a "community" as much as a religion ... an ethnic group.  OK.  I went into the book very open-minded, receptive even, looking for the "life," the joy I hear there is supposed to be in Judaism.  Telling me that I was born a pagan, that I'm still part pagan because Christianity is part pagan, and slamming Christianity throughout the book, made me angry. 
 The depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned. From the moment they reached King Kong's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience. I felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape. How can anyone feel anything for King Kong? He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes. I kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end 
 Uhhh, puh-lease. Okay, maybe a little kid who was like, 3 would like it, but older kids will find themselves snoring away. I had to read this book for school. It is about two unintelligent little kids who get a dog. They lose the dog. They are sad. They can't figure out who took the dog. The dog comes back. Whoop-dee-doo. End. Ya see? I could have written this book better. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!! EVER!! 
 Item worked for one year, three weeks.  Then had widely varing temperature readings, or indications that the oven had reached over maximum temperature (500+ degrees) when oven was set for 325 degrees.  
 Listen closely to what others are writing - this is ssssooo basic and poorly recorded that it really is of no help. If you have the book it may be a bit easier. I actually got this for myself to help me with my own pronuciation and you can hardly hear what the young voices are saying. Sorry I got it but my 4 month old niece likes it 
 When a documentary includes commentary from such key artists as Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra and Tommy Ramone, an interesting and rich story of punk music is to be expected. Punk: Attitude fails to deliver.   Despite the fact that the material is organized chronologically, there is no story to help weave everything together. To make things worse, many of the performers featured are extremely obscure and have little, if any, significance to the core of punk music. There are several times during the film where a scenester commentator like Rollins says, "I wouldn't really say they were punk," when referring to a featured band.   Nearly all of the featured bands border on pop; very little time is devoted to heavy or political bands. Additionally, the coverage ends very abruptly in the early 80's, makes quick mention of a few hardcore punk bands (Dead Kennedys, Exploited, and Agnostic Front), makes a very poor attempt at tieing rap to punk, and jumps to Nirvana--hardly punk by any standard. To give an example of how disjointed this film is, there is a punk-rap connection in the fact that the Beastie Boys, who are featured here, crossed-over; the documentary fails to even note that they began as a punk band!   There are a few interesting tidbits featured in this documentary. For example, there is some information about the origin of the Rasta influence on punk and the British punk fashion scene that is responsible for the stereotypical punk image (bondage pants, high-end boots, safety-pinned ripped clothing, etc.). However, any positives are completely overshadowed by the extremely shallow ending in which the Rollins pays tribute to Michael Moore and makes a less-than-motivating plea for punks to become more involved in politics.   If taken at face value, you'll leave this believing that punk began, flourished, and died between the late-`60's and early-`80's, consisted almost completely of pop-punkers like the Pretenders, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Blondie, and the Clash, and was resurrected in the early `90's by Nirvana. Pathetic 
 I was look for a book teaching and showing different kinds of braiding the hair; from french braid, corn rows, and extentions.  But I can't tell what is really in this book. I don't know if it covers some of the things I'm looking for or none of what I'm looking for.  If there were pictures of the kinds of braids it was covering or even a discription of what kind on braids are in here or even a back cover review of what is in this book.  But sorrifully NO.  Therefore I put down the unknown content book; for I don't like buying anything in the dark.  And I'll move on look for the author that did tell me what is in the book and showing me pictures.  Until then rethink about sharing more about what is in the book and even about you 
 Christopher Hitchens places himself as a radical political contraire, desperately seeking to impart his wisdom to youthful students of foreign affairs; he gives answers to unasked questions and revels in his own glorious self. I like Hitchens and think he was once one of the great journalists in the world, but lately his egoism and opportunism have gotten a little hard to take. Listen, to brashly and stupidly apologize for the crimes of George W. Bush when you were once a self-proclaimed Trotskyite is not being "independent-minded," it's selling out. Notice how polemicists who change their worldview always seem to migrate towards the center of power, never the other way around. This is a rather useless little book in which Hitchens is constantly making love and equating his style to George Orwell which is just pitiful, Orwell never had to directly impart his virtue to others in letter form, it was always right there in his novels and essays, and that is what Hitchens cant seem to understand, a true journalistic dissident does not have to expound his views, they're right there on the page, let the readers think for themselves. I'd like to see Hitchens return to the valuable work he has done in the past and stop trying to make a cheap buck off this schlock.            
 The 2002 version of the Star Wars core rulebook is an improvement over the original.  It upgrades some underpowered character classes, adds some breadth, and makes much-needed improvements to the very abstract and annoying vehicle operation system used in the 1999 rulebook.  Unfortunately, the central, crippling problem with the 1999 version remains:  the d20 system just isn't well-suited to Star Wars storytelling.  Playing this game is nothing like playing out a Star Wars story, and a lot like playing Dungeons and Dragons in space.  Star Wars is fast-moving, fluid, and dynamic, and not much concerned with power balance.  A kid fresh off the moisture farm can fight his way past elite enemy troops to save the princess, and one Sith Lord can arrange the downfall of the entire Jedi order.  Audacity and heroic (or villainous) attitudes matter more than experience and number-crunching.  Major characters rarely die, and then only if there's a strong dramatic reason for it.  Plotlines are loose and free-form.  A game based on Star Wars should reflect that.  By contrast, d20 is very cut-and-dried, and very regulated, and much too lethal.  Concepts like "level", "class", and "hit points" are fundamental to the d20 system, but are not very applicable to the Star Wars universe.  The system has a lot going for it, and it's great for Dungeons and Dragons, but here it's a case of trying to stuff a square peg into a round hole.  I prefer the West End Games "d6" version released in the late 1980s.  It has its flaws - it doesn't deal with very powerful characters as well as it might, and character creation could use some tuning (particularly for Force-sensitive PCs) - but it captures the feel of Star Wars.  A revision of that rule system, or a completely new system incorporating the best features of both d6 and d20, would have been a much better choice than using the d20 system as a "one-size-fits-all" set of mechanics.  However, it seems unlikely that Wizards of the Coast will forsake their flagship d20 system for something as high-profile as Star Wars.  So I suggest that if you really want to get into gaming in the Star Wars universe, look for a used copy of the West End Games version 
 I wish there was a choice of 0 stars, 'cause that's what I'd give this movie. This isn't a rudolph sequel because all it revolves around is time, fairy tales, and nonsense.  It should have featured the old characters that we grw up with, but instead they decide to mix together a troll, ben franklin, a knight, baby new year, and fairy tales to create a horrible movie. What were they thinking? 
 Dr Sears completely ignores the HUGE population of working mothers!  The book goes on and on and on about attachment parenting and how you should allow your child to disattach from you and not the other way around....well, the majority of the mother's in this world do not have this choice!  Furthermore, he made me feel as though I was a selfish mother for not carrying my daughter on my hip for the first year of her life.  My daughter is very attached to me and we have a very close relationship....yet I started back at work full time when she was 8 weeks old.  I feel that Dr Sears only addressing those mothers that stay at home full time and even then he cautions about leaving your child!  Easy for him to say!!!! 
 Excellent book for anyone interested in drawing the human figure.  Deals well and extensively with proportion, anatomy and nuances of figure drawing.  Required by my art teacher and worth the money as an on-going reference source 
 Brenda Maddox' ROSALIND FRANKLIN: THE DARK LADY OF DNA and ROSALIND FRANKLIN AND DNA by Anne Sayre both imply that Rosalind Franklin was the true discoverer of DNA and that James Watson & Francis Crick, with the help of Maurice Wilkins, stole her discovery.  Rosalind Franklin was no doubt an excellent scientist, a molecular biologist, who, along with Linus Paulding in the US, sought to solve the puzzle of DNA. She was a painstaking researcher, who compiled much of the fundamental data on the subject (in the form of x-ray photos of DNA). Her work provided the crucial information that enabled Watson & Crick to make their breakthrough discovery of the structure of DNA.  But the fact remains that, while she had the information, she did not make the discovery. Watson & Crick did. Could she have arrived at their conclusion give more time and more research? Perhaps. But the question is irrelevant. She didn't. They did. Watson & Crick did not "steal" her discovery. They made it on their own - no doubt with the invaluable help of her data.   But that is the way scientific discoveries are made. The great breakthroughs are always based on previous inconclusive research and data compiled by other scientists. Such information is the common property of the scientific community, not the private property of individual researchers. Progress is made through the sharing of data, studies and findings. Science progresses not in secret, but through an open system of shared information.   The credit for any scientific discovery goes to those who reach the solution first, not to those who work toward the solution or provide the data on which the solution is ultimately based.   The fact is that such discoveries are often the result of a combination of painstaking research and illuminating insight. Rosalind Franklin was a painstaking researcher. But it was Watson & Crick who had the brilliant insight.  I believe that this episode is an example of Thomas Kuhn's theory of the function of paradigms - the framework of existing concepts that dominate any field of human endeavor. The effect of paradigms is to "blind" those who work within the existing conceptual framework to possibilities that become visible to those who work "outside the box," - i.e. outside the paradigm. To work within an existing paradigm is to expect a certain solution and, inevitably, to look for that solution.   I believe that this is probably what happened with the discovery of DNA. While Rosalind Franklin was working within the framework of the existing molecular biological paradigm, Watson & Crick stepped outside the box and were able to view the data in a new and different way. This was because neither Watson (a zoologist & bacteriologist) nor Crick (a physicist turned chemist) were molecular biologists and were therefore not trapped in the existing paradigm of molecular biology. This enabled them to see what Franklin and Paulding didn't see. Therefore, it was Watson & Crick who became the discoverers of the structure of DNA and received the credit, and the Nobel Prize they fully deserved.  To give Rosalind Franklin credit for the research she did and the data she so painstakingly assembled (data which enabled Watson & Crick to make their breakthrough discovery) is a generous thing. But for these authors to imply that they "stole" her discovery is inaccurate. It has far less to do with the pursuit of scientific or historic truth than it does with the pursuit of a feminist agenda. 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 The documentation is terrible. Its going to take a lot of practice. If you're just going to stick it on top your camera its fine. However I want to use it off-camera to trigger 2 x SB600s. Just setting the D200 to fire a pre-flash that will trigger the SB800/Masster & SB600s it's a nightmare and its not covered in any detail, in the manual.  The SB800 is designed for this purpose. So why not include information on how to do this? 
 "Sweet Baby Jane" Perkins is a mega-selling rock star in need of a bodyguard and Jason Wilson, an ex-Army Ranger, is her man!   This is the first time I read a book by Cindy Gerard and maybe I should have tried a little bit harder, but it was a real struggle just to finish the first 50 pages. So it could be I didn't give it a fair chance.... but here's what I think.  The first thing that bothered me, was the fact that someone in the band is harassing Jane. I don't find the sexual harassement and obnoxious behavior believable: who is this guy anyway?? He is not the star of the show, he should have been fired long ago. Problem solved, but I guess he is needed for the storyline. What finished my attempt to continue to read the book is the fact that after something really awful has happened, Jane decides not to confide in the one person who stood by her all these years and made her in the star she is (namely her manager Max), for fear that he would cancel the gig. If I had read on I might have learned all the reasons why she feels that - no matter what - the show must go on. But frankly I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters and their lines and their emotions (up to page 50) just fell flat.   So..... for sale: a (hardly) used book in excellent condition! 
 This one is a trip to say the least. It starts strange even from  the menu (my menu's play button says "On Air"). Then we go steaming into the movie itself. A crazy housewife throws herself and her retarded son off a building. Cut to a mildly intense (and very exploitively shot) rape scene. Then we are experiencing the day to day happenings of a home for the retarded - where the head administrator is the rapist. I'm not really spoiling anything here. The movie lets this on about 20 minutes in. The man that plays the rapist goes over the top, to say the least. At one point he stalks around his room, crazy and horny  (wearing a jock strap, no less) fondling and strangling a  mannequin. The movie tries to hide its lust for exploitation under the guise of being a film about a serious subject. You can ultimately tell that it was filmed for the T and A. There's quite a bit during the two rape scenes. Also, the helpful teacher gets dolled up towards the end. Although her idea of being sexy is seductively drinking a clamdigger - celery included. But there is no nudity from her sadly (I think she's cute). And it is rather off putting to have the guy walking around in more revealing uderwear than the women. I mean, he's wearing a thong, for God's sake! Is this a Chinese metaphor for being "crazy and sexually rapacious"? You be the judge. I will say, I have seen a lot of bizarre translations on Asian imports, but this one contains one of the classics. During a scene when an angry crowd is confronting the administrator out front of the home - a man yells in his face and says "You let me f*** and a**  and I say your good, damn!" And he's supposed to be angry at this guy? Truly a hilarious moment. And people in the film refer to rapists as "sex lupines". I really don't know how to translate that one. Ultimately a bizarre flick that doesn't deliver on much that it promises. The rape scenes are not too schocking (especially when compared to something like IRREVERSIBLE). I will say the last sequence is pretty gruesome. Fluorescent bulbs and table saws, anyone? Ultimately, a lot of the acting comes off as B-grade. Some sickos out there - we are legion - might enjoy parts, but most would probably prefer to stay away.  I'm keeping my copy though... 
 This book is very general. There is absolutely no useful information. Any body could write this book in probably two sentences. I'll give it a try. "Acquire somebody's birth certificate and scan it. Change the  necessary information and bingo". There you have it without spending  $20 
 Don't be fooled. This book has a title very similar to The Ultimate Book of Kid Concocitons book I saw on PBS. I bought this book thinking it was the PBS book and was very upset. I'm sure I am not the only one making this mistake. The projects in this book are out dated and seem to be the same old things that have been around for years, Buyer beware! I would bet the publisher did this to trick people into buying there book 
 i was listening to this album last night on trick or treat night, and I hate this album, the lyrics are nasty, the songs are nasty and the singer can't sing. Bon Scott is such a mean vocalist and he sure screams a lot and he is always angry. This also has lots of sex, drugs, and just worse than any of the albums Guns N' Roses ever did. I like them better, they rock and they always did something better than what these guys did. If I bought this album back in 1979 and if I listened to all the songs, I would kill the whole band, definately Bon. This is just as bad as Back in Black. AC/DC is the worst band of all time. This is an album which every rock fan needs to avoid please. I can't believe anyone likes AC/DC. Anyone who likes AC/DC is a looser because they suck. This is a good album if you want to be angry all the time because this is the meanest angriest album of all time. Worse than any Beatles. Dire Straits are better because they did atleast 45-50 great songs and all their albums are great. These guys never did a good album or song these guys suck! Please stay away from these guys or youre a looser. Dire Straits has the best singer, Mark Knopfler he is always a nice guy and he can sing properly. Pick Withers is even better than Phil Rudd, Pick Withers is the best drummer of all time in history. Making Movies is the best from Dire Straits which has the loveliest songs i have ever heard, Skateaway! Buy all their albums. Buy Dire Straits insted. 
 I HAVE FOUND THIS SITE DISAPPOINTING ON FINDING MY TRI COLOR INK #78 THAT I NEED FOR MY HP 750. THIS WEB SITE NEEDS MORE CHOICES. IF THE STORE SELLS IT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND IT HERE 
 This book is below the basic need of any Loss Prevention Professional, and  most business owners. The author fills space with meaningless things such  as how to describe a suspect, numbers for government agencies.......Don't  waste your time and money 
 Rising Sun was a terrible read.  Crichton uses one device throughout:  the old hand knows everything an hour before the young guy and slowly reveals it to him.  It's tiring and monotonous.  Never mind the even more monotonous lectures on the differences between American and Japanese business cultures. 
 While I Was Gone, by Sue Miller, reads suspiciously like a blend of the steadily increasing numbers of this genre of WASP apologist novels. To my jaded eyes, these offensively scrupulous tales appear to be written for WASP C Average women college graduates of A plus incomes.  I am certain that many of these readers will consider themselves more well-read and better understood for having consumed a stack of this stuff by similar writers. Somehow, WASPS everywhere will feel that instead of being emotionally constipated and terminally civilized, that they are, as usual, better than everyone else who isn't like them.  The characters, including the animals, are for the most part, good-looking, privileged, educated, and eminently acceptable. Suspension of disbelief is just not happening here. This novel pays some token hommage to the strife of teenage parenting and the shoals of marriage. Yet, it remains smug and self-satisfied conveying beyond a shadow of a doubt that these superior folks are going to soldier on and become even better than they already are for having erred on the side of humanity.  Ugh! Just once it would have been nice to experience a character like Jo screaming at her minister husband Daniel to cease his sadistic sanctimonius silent cruelty and put himself in her place. Alas, no, that sort of low-class behaviour can never exist in the rarified world of the dazzlingly narcissictic humble.  I would exhort Sue Miller to redeem herself by writing about some low-born WASPS who know how to crochet toilet roll covers and make gloppy casseroles while drowning in some decently offensive hypocracy 
 Before I saw this movie I thought I would enjoy it. I enjoyed watching the miniseries when I was a kid. However, nothing could prepare me for what I was about to watch on screen. It was an absolute disaster of a film. I do enjoy superhero movies, some recent ones I like are the Spiderman series and Batman. But the Hulk did not inspire me at all, it was like going to the Dentist to get a tooth pulled. The character is a cartoon-like green figure, totally lacking in his emotional capacities, not even his rage convinced me, it looked like a video game more than a movie. This film had no serious plot worthy of mention. It was just plain painful to watch. If I could give it half a star I would!  
 Scots, maybe, but usually just plain Scottish. Scotch is a common name for whisky.  It amazes me how many people here tell me that they are "Scotch-Irish" - to me it makes them sound like an idiot. 
 I tried this on the day I got it to see how it felt.  The velcro is so strong that when I tried to take it off, the velcro ripped the top layer of the material right off.  I would not advise buying this.  I was dissappointed in the quality of this product. 
 I don't know how this book got so many good reviews.  From the first chapter, I was bored out of my mind.  The author spends entirely too much time describing EVERY LITTLE DETAIL, and that includes the unimportant characters about to be killed.  Meanwhile, the main character is perfect.   Absolutely perfect in every possible way.  The perfect warrior, sorceress,  leader, rebel, and mother.  Not to mention the fact that she's exceedingly  beautiful.  I can't remember another character who annoyed me so much just  by being her wonderful, arrogant self.  The only reason I even gave this  book two stars instead of one is because at the end, you finally get to see  what part the sorceress Nyadnar has in all of this.  That part was  creative, but the rest was just plain dull.  Try to avoid this title unless  you feel compelled  to read every single Forgotten Realms title 
 It is a mind projecting book, this is why Robert Bruce has never met any divine beings, it is a common sense that astral projection you are able to visit or seeing beings from other dimensions, and Robert Bruce has none.  This is why he cannot explain many paranormal phenomena during astral travels, because he has never actually projected out 
 This book addresses some of the questions I have about alternative medicine but it is definitely not probing deeply into the questions surrounding medical treatment as was mentioned in the praise from Dr. Bill Bright  on the first page of the book. It touches the surface and quotes the Bible a little. There was not even a mention about the foods God recommends and advises not to eat.This book was a waste of my time. 
 Do not waste your time reading this book. Read Carolyn Wheat's Funhouse of mystery and suspense. This book is ok, but not great. The examples he uses are mostly from his own books. These examples are terrible. You will be able to write a mystery after you read this book, but not a "damn good" as evidenced by the popularity of Frey's own books.If Frey could have written a "damn good" mystery, then why hasn't he. 
 Shame on the Unofficial Guide folks.  After the success of the WDW guide I think they decided to make a few extra bucks on the Disneyland folks so they threw out a book just to have one.  I am a huge fan of the WDW Unofficial Guide and I've read it cover to cover and I can't believe how much of the stuff in this book is exactly the same as the WDW guide.  Basically all they did is cut and paste from that guide and market it as a Disneyland guide.  Here is why I was so upset with this guide.  No hotel information and no restaurant information.  One thing I use the WDW guide for is to find out specifics about Disney hotels (do they have laundry, how are the rooms laid out, etc).  They had NOTHING about the Grand Californian.  I found out more from Disney's website.  Also they have no info about restaurants.  They have like one paragraph just mentioning restaurants but nothing like the WDW guide with descriptions and ratings.   Overall I found the book quite useless and a waste of money.  Shame on them for throwing a bunch of regurgitated and useless info a book and then charging us for it.  If you're going to WDW, buy the Unofficial guide, if you're going to Disneyland skip it.  Ironically I actually found the Birnbaum Official guide more useful for Disneyland 
 Considering the way that the authors harp so much on the fact of archives being released, they show an amazing ignorance of what the archives have actually revealed.  We now have demographic analyses of the Soviet population in the 1930s that have been performed off of the heretofore unavaliable archives and they show a total of about 20.4 million deaths having occurred from all causes (old age included) in the years 1934-1939.  Yet Haynes & Klehr repeat with a straight face the absurd claim manufactured for Cold War purposes by Robert Conquest that "more than 20 million" were somehow killed by the Soviet state within just 1937-1938 alone.  This amounts to saying that old age is a Communist conspiracy. Although hundreds of thousands of executions occurred in these years, the "tens of millions" blather from the Cold War has fallen apart.  What is especially deceitful about Kaynes & Klehr is that they pass on such nonsense in a tone which gives the inexperienced reader an impression that somehow the archives have proven Conquest to be correct, when the reality is just the reverse.  Likewise the myth of the "artificial Ukrainian famine" has been quietly imploding under the weight of overwhelming archival evidence that a famine caused by natural disaster affected the whole of the Soviet Union and that collectivization subsequently improved the food production system.  Mark Tauger is the leading expert on this topic at present and his work draws from the archives in the most detailed way, whereas the more famous books from the Cold War by Robert Conquest do not.  These are facts which are slowly coming out based upon the most detailed archival records and if the knowledge of this hasn't spread widely yet then after a couple of generations have passed it will likely be close to common wisdom.  But Haynes & Klehr do not want the reader to know what archives have revealed.  An inexperienced reader picking this book up for the first time might get the impression that Archibald Getty is some crackpot divorced from the real documentary record and that Robert Conquest has been rigorously telling the history that is reflected in documents.  The reality is exactly the reverse.  It was also clear that the lead-off in the book sought to give the reader the impression that Deborah Lipstadt had somehow rigorously demonstrated a point in a tightly fought case.  The reality is that the whole case was a game for the public.  If revisionism about Lipstadt's alleged expertise is what interests you then you'd do better to skip David Irving and go straight to Carlo Mattogno.  Mattogno is the leading expert on the types of questions which were allegedly at issue in the trial, not Irving.  It's just another example of how this whole is made of misleading suggestions that are meant to steer the reader off of real evidence on anything 
 Hurriedly churned out. Pop. Superficial. Still, fun in a sophomoric way. There are many ways one might find enlightenment, even by stubbing your toe. But, stubbing your toe is cheaper, and leaves a longer lasting impression. Beautiful cover art, though. Too bad it doesn't relate to the content 
 With all due respect to sincere but sincerely misguided believers who look to Carl Sagan+Hugh Ross scientific priesthood to explain Genesis Origins for them 'logically & scientifically', address these loving Christian concerns:  1) It's o.k. to debate biblical issues in a public forum. Attacks on the faith come from outside and INSIDE. Ross is unwittingly attacking the authority of Scripture from INSIDE and needs rebuking in love and truth.  2) It's not whether some portions of Scripture are literal vs. nonliteral. It's letting the Bible speak for itself and clearly indicate how it's to be read. 'God as Rock' in Psalms is poetry. Genesis is NOT Psalms or even psalmic. 'Evening and morning were first day', etc. is NOT poetry or figurative. See Exodus 20:9-11 '6 days you shall labor, but the 7th day is a Sabbath.In 6 days the LORD made heaven and earth..but rested on the 7th day.' Is this poetry? Psalms? Not. Sorry to all who force this historic documentary narrative text to be plastic enough to insert saganism billions & billions. It just is not what Moses intended to write or Hebrews understood him to mean. Nor should it be today. Yom can sometimes (not normatively) mean indefinite period, but NOT here. Try your theory elsewhere.  3)Take care when you depend on modern astrophysics to interpret the plain Bible text. Moses was not a PhD nor scientist. Neither are billions who have read Genesis in the past 3500 years. If vast majority take Moses in plain simple sense 6 days equals Sunday thru Friday of first workweek, astrophysics reinterpreting it to 17 billion years is humanism dismissing God's creative supernatural miracles. Reductionism and unbelief.  4)What's the big deal whether Genesis is real, literal, documentary, history book young earth recent creation as plainly stated in situ? Get it wrong here and it carries over to the rest of Scripture. If Genesis 1-11 is poetry or nonliteral story or myth or figures of speech, then so is Exodus, plagues, Red Sea, miracles, Ex.20:9-11, etc. and even into New Testament documents. It's now all up for grabs just the way satan wants it. By all means, doubt the plain wording of God's Word! Slippery slope-ism = sloppy theology = slapdash hermeneutics = slippage in Christian faith.  5)To be fair, why not try reversing the 'harmonization' process? Instead of forcing Scripture into Sagan-Ross mold of fallible secular theory of billions & billions of lightyears, try letting 6 calendar days of God's infallible heavenly recording of eyewitness events be the fixed standard of how human inquiry should be reconciled to the real record. Science must be somehow wrong in its assumptions, assessments, conclusions. God must have turned heaven's lights on instantly with speed of light = infinity during sun/moon/star creation Day 4 when scattered, disembodied light already existed for 72 hours instantly became bodied. Today's scientists from saganism to rossism are using earthbound measurements on heavenly reality. Their mistake is understandable given limited preconceived notions of how things operate POST-miracle week. God's presuppositions are needed as divine corrective. Telescopes and parallax and triangulation and math don't work on Creation Week itself any more than other sciences trying to figure out and measure Jesus' DNA, changing water to wine instantly, casting out demons, Peter's shadow healing the sick or the Lord's resurrection, materializing in and out of sight over 40 days penetrating locked doors with a real flesh/blood body, ascension, etc.  Friends, it's all a category mistake. You simply can't use earthy calipers to come to grips with heavenly data. Back to the drawing board of faith in Genesis-Revelation AS WRITTEN ORIGINALLY UNDERSTOOD BY AUTHOR/AUDIENCE of 1500BC to avoid the fallacy in saganism-rossism-modernism-revisionism-secularsciencism.   Peace to all who let Christ's Bible speak without manscience stretching 1 young week.  
 This review is purposely overly harsh in an effort to achieve a counter-balance.  In truth, it deals with one, inexcusible, chapter re: The Great Queen [i.e. The Morrighan].  He *really* fummbled the ball, here (and that's being generous!).  Having read nearly all of the books listed in these authors' Bibiography, I firmly disagree with their interpretations of The Morrighan, entirely.  In essence, they seem to have been imposing their views onto the evidence at hand.  Further insulting was the way in which they extended an olive branch to Medb in an effort to completely excuse Her from War-Goddess status.  However, they refuse to extend the same grace to The Morrighan when, according to the Medieval concepot of war-fare [inter-tribal catle raids] Medb is more of a War-Goddess than The Morrighan will ever be!  Most scholars, today, seem to be referring to Her not as a War-Goddess, but as one of the following: Tutelary-/Sovereign-/Earth-Goddess.  In fact, recent academic articles by one Maire Herbert have exploded this out-dated War-Goddess model as it's applied to The Morrighan.  This out-dated model is, unfortunately, the result of early Classicist idealogy being imposed onto non-Classical Gods and Goddesses (this model stems ONLY from one article written in 1870, and has stuck ever sense, unquestioned, and undefied erroniously-so by Pagans).  He further insults any well-informed reader by calling Her a "Battle Fury" (scholars are unanimously firm in their belief that She never actually engages in battle).  Some other choice descriptions (which are abhorantly over-stepping the bounds of all reasonable research) are: She is a Goddess of a severe psychotic episodes, and that She is the personification of the cool, calculated, mentality of a serial killer!  None of this is borne out via the research!  I suggest that ANYONE interested in researching Her, turn to the following scholars (he referenced only to the last text listed, and seemed to have ignored that the author was emphatic in stating that She is an Earth-Goddess; others state She is also from a Mother-Goddess Cult, too):  * The Witch Figure -- Ed. V. Newall [Contains an article by Dr. Anne Ross] * The Concept of the Goddess -- Ed. Miranda Green [contains two academic articles by two Irish scholars which define Her as an Earth-Goddess, a genius loci, and one even blowing a part the War-Goddess model, Aspect, with no answers possible!] * The Celtic Hgeroic Age -- Ed. & Trans. John Carey & John Koch [Often defines The Morrighan strictly AS Anann, the Irish Mother-Goddess.] * The Great Queens: Irish Goddesses from the Morrighan to Cathleen Ni Houlihan -- Rosalind Clark [She has some excellent info. re: The Morighan as an Earth-/Tutelary-/Fertility-/Cow-/Sovereignty-Goddess.] * War Goddess: THe Morrighan & Her Germano-Celtic Counterpart -- Angelique Epstein [Still a good text, even though she relies far too heavily upon the now out-dated War-Goddess model; she puts Irish "warfare" into it's propper perspective, which is truly alien to the modern Pagan re: what we concieve of as "war".] * The Ancient Celts -- Barry Cunliffe  The utter nerve that he would dare state this chapter as objective research is insulting to academia, as well as to Pagans, who are taking them at their word!  His clear, unthinking bias (and hypocricy when the Medb chapter is taken into account), is clear, and unforgivible to this Pagan (and researcher)!  I don't trust him as a researcher.  In fact, his views concernign academia are lacking, for example, re: Ronald Hutton.  He doesn't understand so much about the academic community, and that Hutton is often mistaken re: his personal assumptions.  But, McColman merely writes any of his critics off (who question anything he writes, no matter how miniscule) as "not knowing what they're talking about!"  No researcher would (especially an academic) would be so foolish!  Any truly advanced student in the subject will quickly see the huge problems concerning this book and how he type-casts the Gods (which is academically inexcusible!) 
 The book is poorly written, full of fictional rantings and generally liberal recapping of other historial history books. The author rants like a lunatic and how this book was ever published is a mystery to me. 
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 My mother-in-law bought this to make coffee for visitors. It worked fine at first but, after one or two months of use, started to experience water leaks of increasing severity. At first there were drips outside of the carafe. Then the leaks streamed around the carafe and out of body joints. We put the whole machine on a metal tray--to make clean-up easier. Finally it got so bad that, fearing an encounter with boiling hot water and/or the risk of an electrical shock, we stopped using it.  In the end, I was able to make coffee by removing the filter basket (it's a circular one-piece with a tiny hole in the middle) from the machine and placing the basket carefully on top of an empty mug. I then inserted a filter, coffee, and poured in hot water from a stove-top kettle. While this sounds ridiculous, it's a lot easier and less stressful than facing unpredictable streams of boiling water and the rancid smells of coffee residue trapped in the seams of the machine.   My recommendation: avoid this machine. It's disturbing that Black and Decker would produce a product so dangerous and lacking in quality 
 This is not a book and I have no idea what a "sourcing fee" is.  Save your money and don't buy this item 
 It took so long I had forgotten I had ordered it and almost bought it at a book store! Beyond that, the cover was horribly bent and torn, it was yellow, the spine was nearly shattered from use, and it wasnt even the same edition I ordered! Ugh 
 I should have done extensive research prior to buying this book, it lacks a very important feature in my opinion, the sample pictures have no information on how it was taken, no shutter speed, ISO lens or F-stop guides. I later found such a book, but I will allow you to do your own research 
 Celine's voice is her trademark to continue her life in this business of music, although she hasn't show talent in the writing music way, is no mistake this canadian girl can sing, Thank God For That!, but Colour Of My Love is a pure example that an amazing voice can't always save medioquer written songs, Celine's third 550 Music album feautures one of the lady most incredible performances: "The Power Of Love", this song has been record by many, but Celine made it her own, and is not question that it will be difficult to make another version that surpases this gem.  Sadly this precious tune is surrounded by filler ballads, lame upbeat tracks, and unsensitive creativitiless music.  The only kind-of-ok songs after the superb leading single are, the upbeat "Mislead", and the misty "Think Twice" 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 This book contains gems:  there is no question about  that.  The `reading-literacy' project was given solid funding by the government and Ms. Adams has done a superlative job of surveying the literature and coming up with reasonable conclusions.    That said, there is a problem.  And the problem is that "Beginning to Read" was written for bureaucrats.  The straightforward language we might expect from an educator and researcher is therefore made obscure, obtuse, and overly `officious'.  [No doubt pleasing to the edu-crats.]  For example, (from page 413; the summary):  "It is because of the process of comprehension consists of actively searching the overlap among words for syntactic and semantic coherence that reading depends so critically on the speed and automaticity of word recognition."  [Or, in other words, reading comprehension depends on speed and automatic word recognition so that the nascent reader can make use of syntax and semantics. ]  Not incomprehensible in it's original form, Adam's verbiage is awkward and somehow embarrassing for a book that is supposed to be about `reading' and `comprehension'.    Three Stars.   A comprehensive survey of current and past literature, this book  attempts--and in my opinion succeeds-- in reconciling the phonics versus whole language camps.   However, expect a slog of it.  [Unless of course you are an edu-crat in which case the officiousness will sound very convincing indeed-lol]  Anyone else interested in this topic but with less time might find the same information in a `tastier' format in the following books:  Mem Fox's "Reading Magic"; and the slightly less digestible "Raising Lifelong Learners" by Lucy McCormick Calkins.  
 They say this stuff isn't messy - I'd like to know what your definition of messy is.  I will not keep this product in my home, but I do have several of my little boy's friends who have requested it for b-day's, etc.  Therefore, I will be purchasing more I'm sure 
 This is utter rot. Another stinker from the withered pen of MCall Smith. Plotless, overly peppered with Mr McCall Smith's book of quotations, up-tight, and worst of all - boring.  Mr McCall, don't give up the day job 
 Legend, Lies & Cherished Myths of American history is a misleading title.  Do not assume this book to among likes of James Lowen's publications.  Some aspects of the book seem factual.  However, many arguements he makes such as the American revolution was not revolutionary at all, are completly rediculous.  This is yet another book in this kind of genre based upon assumptions and poor research. Avoid it at all costs.    Brian DeDentro (Rhode Island College 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 Let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie. 1. It is incredibly beautiful animation 2. The music is amazing 3. I happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series The Things I don't like about the movie: 1. The characters are not developed at all 2. You get the feeling your only skimming the surface, like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3. It almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process.  Ok you may have see that I gave this moive a 2 out of 5, well that is becuase of the story line and plot.The story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation. The movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end. I just kept thinking there has to be more. But there wasn't. The best way I could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just couldn't find its parents. This movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff. But if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please don't buy it rent it first. I'm not saying its a bad movie by any means, just a bit empty for me.Just one more thing the Escaflowne series is very very good don't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series 
 This book is the centerpiece of a very scary and disturbing legal altercation in which the publisher, CRC Press LLC, basically tried to strong-arm Eric W. Weisstein into gaining complete control over the material on his mathworld website, after he signed a contract for them to publish this book, which is essentially a snapshot of the material.  I would urge everyone to show personal support for Eric W. Weisstein in whatever way possible--donations are a great idea.  However, by buying this book you are supporting a company that is greedy and downright creepy.  You're also encouraging other companies to do the same.  We need to show the publishing industry that greed does not pay--and one great way of doing that is by not buying this book 
 I have been in Technical analysis for more than 4 years and have many books on the subject but of all the books I have "The Encyclopedia of Technical Market Indicators" is the most misguided title ever. Motivation for this statement is that the book is almost like an empty vessel. The author relates to numerous indicators and indicates how successful or unsuccessful they are but without explanations which make it difficult to comprehend. Also nowhere in the book does he indicate how these indicators should be used which, in my opinion, should be the essence of a book with this title. The author attempts to correct this on his website at: www.robertwcolby.com 
 I have seen bad movies but this is one of the worst, dont waste your time, thank god I had it by a copy from a friend, sorr 
 This book totally and completely defeated the purpos 
 I bought this because I wanted an encrypted device that I could use to offload personal documents I receive while traveling for work, and then read them using my Mac(s) at home.  Lexar JD II is the only product I found advertised to work with both Macs and PCs at the same time.    My primary Mac is an Intel Mac.  Early on I realized the encryption utility only runs on PPC Macs.  Okay, so I figured I'd use it on the PPC Mac Mini, and everything seeemed fine at first.     Then I hit a problem where my Mac Mini could not read video DVDs.  A little search on the Mac support forums, and I found that installing Lexar JD software disables video DVD support on my Mac!  Fortunately there were instructions on how to uninstall.  Aside from the problems with the Macs, I also hit the problem another reviewer mentioned, which is that you must be logged in as a LOCAL administrator to use the encryption software under Windows.  Since my work PC is a member of a domain, I had to create a local account, log off the work domain and back on as a local user to use encryption anyway. Kingston Data Traveler Elite works fine under Windows domain logins, unfortunately for me they don't have Mac software yet.    So in summary the current Lexar encryption software: - Can't be used on a Windows domain machine - Can't be used on an Intel Mac - Breaks the DVD on a PPC Mac  It's not for me!  However if you are using the Lexar strictly on stand-alone Windows PCs, OR you don't require encryption, it should be okay. 
 For the price, this product should receive the Cruciatus Curse ad infinitum. The material is all synthetic (I was expecting a wool blend, though the ad said nothing about what the hat and scarf were made of), the relatively loose weave means it will not last as long, and one of the tassels fell off the scarf after just one wearing. I dislike being taken advantage of just so I can make my daughter happy. She is disappointed as well. It was a lot of money to pay to get the Hogwarts crest on a patch that wasn't even fully embroidered. J.K. Rowling should be upset that English Woolens, with which this product will be associated by people who are not in the know, will acquire such a poor image because of the greed of the licensing people 
 I love good thrillers, and am willing to put up with a few flaws for the sake of a good story. But I had to stop reading this one. There were just too many situations where the characters behaved in completely implausible ways. For example: when the main character Nina's 11-year-old son goes missing, her brother tries to get her to go out to dinner. I cannot imagine that idea even crossing the mind of any actual human I have ever met. Later, while the son is still missing, Nina is attacked and her belongings destroyed by her erstwhile client. In a piece of truly extraordinary dialogue, our heroine declines to inform the police who did it and asks the client whether she did it "because of the case." (A case which Nina had just won for the client.) The client proceeds to verbally attack Nina, who backs down. What?? I am inclined to think the heroine should have been named Ninny--no one that spineless could have made it past the first two weeks of law school, or at least not the one I attended. My capacity for suspending disbelief was pushed far past the breaking point with this silly book 
 This breviary is disappointing to Traditional Catholics! Novus Ordo Catholics will be right at home with this but if you are a Traditional Orthodox Catholic who favors the Roman Rite and who has been traumatized by the profanations inflicted by iconaclastic innovations, this is the same ole same ole Vatican II "stuff." 
 So I bought this album on iTunes, thinking it was legit.... It got two stars, because "Trees" isn't terrible.  The rest is garbage 
 This product is cheap all around. After finally getting the table together when we tried to get the chairs put together, the predrilled holes to help you made the wood split. It is not safe for a child. Looks very cute, but is very poor quality. Even the wood is scraps. You can see where they put two pieces together to make them long enough for the legs of the table. We returned this item and are still on the hunt for a set that we like and that is safe for the kids. 
 Clock radio-alarm does not work. Manufacturer does not list telephone number. Apparently Customer Service does not exis 
 A terrible, terrible waste of money. All this CD serves in doing is to illustrate what a knuckle-head Paul Godfrey is. Face it: no one gives a sh@t about Morcheeba anymore, we're not interested in who 'inspired' them, (poor Annette Peacock - has anyone told her?). The next time we see Paul Godfrey he'll probably be asking that age-old question: "paper or plastic?&quot 
 This kit is just junk. The "deluxe blower brush" is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size. There is a "tweezers" that is just folded aluminum sheet metal - there's no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras. There are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution. The "lintless cleaning cloth" is an about 3" x 5" piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you'll use about three times and then throw away. This kit is not worth buying at any price, because it's not worth the shipping charges 
 We have this phone at my office and it's junk. Reception is awful. I think you could hear better with two Campbell's soup cans and a string. Have a nice day.  
 Artisan has released a horrible recording of a very good, sophisticated comedy that questions the values of marriage.  The DVD I got from the start had poor sound quality, faded color and was actually out of focus.  To add to this this disc started skipping, freezing and even getting the vocals out of sequence with the picture.  Don't waste your money on this release.  Wait for a better release 
 Some problems with this commentary are: 1) Too long - Moo uses too many words to express himself and tries to interact with too much that is not necessary or even helpful; 2) Too atomistic - by focusing on too much detail, Moo tends to lose the forest by focusing on individual trees: he does not always have a solid contextual understanding of passages nor of the flow of the letter; 3) His outline is misguided - Moo is trying to follow rherotical theory but this causes him to embrace an outline that really does not do justice to the content of the book; 4) Theologically askew - Moo is not a "modified Lutheran", he is "basically dispensationalist" and is handicapped by the trappings of the view (i.e., Law is always bad = basically antinomian). If you want just one commentary on Romans, Schreiner is better and more recent 
 light didnt turn off, mirror wouldnt stick on shower wall, and mirror became foggy! 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 Having read several novels by this author, and having been delighted with his characteristic use of language, I picked up this novel from the library.  To say I was disappointed doesn't begin to describe the boredom I suffered while forcing myself to finish this book. Far too many pages are taken up with philosophical dialogue between characters whose voices are nigh indistinguishable.  While I enjoy improbable stories, deus ex machina plot twists remain distasteful to me.   If you're still interested in this book, get it from the library before you invest.  
 Not my cup a tea. Poor sound and average picture. Just for Excalibur freaks...?! 
 This book really was a disappointment. The characters were weak and silly. If could not continue reading due to boredom 
 Whoever wrote the narrative on the inside cover flap did a fantastic job - it made me immediately purchase the book.  I kept reading, thinking that maybe there might be more interesting plot, story, anything.  But alas, I finished the book bitterly disappointed.  If thats all it takes to get published these days, I have 70 volumes of mind numbing journals I want to get published as quickly as possible.  I hate to say it, but it's one of the worst I've ever read 
 First off let me state for the record that I only buy Sony , but I have to advise you against the purchase of the bean walkman. I purchased one in March 2006 and returned it September 2006, as I had purchased replacement insurance and was able to return it because it broke. It is hard to turn off and the usb port cover always pops open, not to mention the headphones always pull out. The FM receiver is hard tune in the daylight as the screen is invisiable. Save your self the hassel!!!!! 
 My daughter purchased this book for me about 6 months ago. I know Dr. Weil is an educated man, but I'm sorry. I just cannot take seriously a man this overweight lecturing on optimum health. Look at the size of this guy. Either he is slipping in triple cheeseburgers and double malteds when no one is looking, or salmon and seaweed are VERY fattening. I would say its probably the former. I kept looking for "after" photos but, alas, there are none. This is how he looks 
 Okay ... it's late, and I'm crabby after wrestling with a wireless network for most of the day.  I bought this bad boy to strengthen the signal for my network. A few really insanity-making points...  FIRST, as several other reviewers have pointed out, apparently you can hook this thing up to your router. Not that the directions tell you that, though. The directions only show connecting to a free-standing PC. (How silly of me to think I could follow the directions.)  I popped over to my local MicroCenter and bought a Linksys PCI card and this HSB2. (I'll usually try and stay with the same brand but MicroCenter had neither a Linksys signal booster or a Hawking PCI Adapter ... if indeed either company makes such a beastie.)  I got home from the store, slapped the Linksys PCI Adapter in, fired up the computer and went to connect the HSB2. Things were going too smoothly. As soon as I unscrewed the antenna from the PCI Adapter the signal disappeared (which is to be expected). I then connected the HSB2 ... and still nothing. Rebooted. Still nothing.   Checked Hawking's website. No user forums ... no nothing.  Checked amazon, thinking that I might get some good tech advice. The reviews say you can put it on the router (what a concept!). I unscrew the antenna on the router (a Linksys WRT54GS) only to discover ... that the HSB2 connector doesn't fit. Argh.  I call the tech support # from the back of the manual. Wrong #. Search the web, find the right #. I call and after a fairly short wait (a pleasant surprise!) I get a guy from India (no surprise there). I can usually understand these guys, but the connection was horrific ... had to start phonetically spelling everything like a WWII fighter pilot ("Kilo ... Bravo ... Whiskey ... Foxtrot...").  Anyway, the tech support guy right away starts talking me through the ROUTER end of things. I told him that I was following the directions (I'm goofy that way) and trying to connect to a PCI card. After a short stint on hold, Mr. Tekkie informs me that the HSB2 is incompatible with the Linksys PCI Adapter (this despite the HSB2 package that says, "Also works with other certified wireless network adapters and devices with removable antennas.") Except that it doesn't.  So.....  Mr. Tekkie THEN suggests I try to hook up the HSB2 to the ROUTER end of things, at which point I inform him that the connectors are incompatible. Another short moment on hold, and he comes back and tells me that I need a HACST coupler to connect the HSB2 to the Linksys Router. "Will the HSB2 be compatible with the router even though it's not compatible with the PCI adapter?" I ask. Tekkie assures me that it will be.  Amazon lists a HACST coupler at about $9.00 USD....can't wait to see what my local MicroCenter hammers me for it. (For installing my network I at least had the wisdom to buy locally so I could return things easier. When I go and pick up the HACST, it'll be trip #4 for the network....)  I might return the HSB2 or I might pick up the HACST ... I'm too tired to decide right now.  Whichever I decide (and I'll update the saga as it unfolds), this HSB2 is getting one star ... for compatibility issues and inexcusable documentation and a user unfriendly website.  Stay tuned!   UPDATE: See my comment that follows this review for an update 
 This is the work of an amateur.  Mr. Vachon is able to build a world, but as far as finding a story and weaving his way into and out of it?  Forget about it.  It's as if he had one idea (which is basically "hey, we're all in finance!  but we're all so debauched and weary yet excitedly aware of reality tv!  whee!") and then went from there without developing three-dimensional characters or plot or pretty much anything of substance.    
 I like to find movies in which current "stars" were not yet household names.  I enjoyed Kate Beckinsale in such recent films as 'Underworld' and 'Van Helsing' and this plot line of one of her earlier films, sounded humorously entertaining.    Kate plays an orphan, Flora Poste, who goes to live with your long lost cousins at Cold Comfort Farm.  Flora likes organization and finds very interesting ways of making her cousins see their true paths in life (often leaving the farm to do so), while simplifying and keeping her life organized.  She's a very charming control freak.  The film has a true, understated British humor and charm with many great one-liners, but I can't say that I found the film to be "hysterically" funny, nor worth the repeat view.  I strongly suggest Greenfingers (Clive Owens) and Saving Grace (Craig Ferguson and Brenda Blethyn) as alternatives in the category of "not yet a household name". 
 I was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera. I had hoped the ultra-wide photos (which was my main reason for going with this camera) also would be ultra sharp, but instead they tended to be soft. The camera has a lag time of about 1/10th of a second, so it's more of a point, shoot and wait camera.   The V705 may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints, but don't expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras. In my opinion, the camera squeezes too much out of a JPEG photo by way of compression and shooting TIF files just isn't practical.  I demand better image quality from my cameras and, when zooming in, I like to see detail. I certainly don't like everything going soft.   
 I thought this was going to be a book of funny and interesting items about the south and southerners. What it turned out to be is a text book! I tossed it into the trash, but pulled it back out so I can donate it to Goodwill 
 With the experience and access of Dick Couch that is touted on the inside flap, I expected something more than what I got. This is a very "novelly" non-fiction book that is light on new or original information, and heavy on the compliments.  SEALs, some of our best and bravest, have withstood some pretty intense criticism as to thier performance in Afghanistan and Iraq - I was particularly interested in getting some insight on that topic - none to be found.   There have been few quality books written on the conflict - mostly due to the covert nature of many of the units currently involved - but you cannot help but notice the sense of inter-service jockeying in the books that have come out. Roberts Ridge, and Down Range both paint glimmering portraits of the SEALS, while "Not a Good Day to Die" really skewers them. In my review of "Not a Good Day.." I point out that Naylor is a writer for the Army times; and mention that there may be some alterior motives for slamming the DEVGRU/SEAL performance in Anaconda, but after reading this and other books, I think his work is superior, and far less biased.  
 Well, someone "kindly" included this book with another I had purchased off of Amazon as a "gift"....and I wish I had never ever read it. If I could give it negative stars I would. I actually read it maybe a year and a half ago and it still nauseates me. The rape, the adultery, I would have jumped off the bridge myelf and taken my unborn child with me. Ugh! I could MAYBE have gotten over the adultery, I mean he WAS ordered to do it after all....but the rape?? Forget it. No way no how. I wish I had never read this book, it honestly makes me want to cry (and not in a good way! 
 As a mystery lover, print collector, and adoptive mom, I picked up this book with high hopes.  Unfortunately, it's a very thin mystery heavily padded with middlebrow arcana about prints, the protagonist's endless should-I-or-shouldn't-I-adopt musings, and makeweight of end-of-term professorial minutiae.  B-o-r-i-n-g.  The most dramatic event in the book features the protagonist's irritation at another single (white, healthy) female wanting to adopt a (white, healthy) female infant, rather than enthusiastically signing up for older, abused children of a different ethnicity.  Instead of suggesting the other woman go to Eastern Europe for such a child, the protagonist sneers at her for not signing up to sainthood.  By the time the book finally reaches its climax, there is a gymnasium full of people who could commit the crime ... well, sort of, if you stretch things and one of them is nuts ...  But no character development, no unexpected twists or turns, and a lot of lectures on prints and the nature (per the author, one presumes) of adoption.  
 i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline.well they needn't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday.i liked both of the main actors,jessica lange and ed harris.the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters.whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio-pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces.the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing 
 I watched this film as part of my history studies in Post-War Europe and before everyone docks me because I gave it two stars, hear me out.  I'm no Godard fan so I may not be able to appreciate this film as a fan of The New Wave might.  I'm just your regular Joe Movie-Watcher.  Masculin Feminin is about Paul, a 21-year-old French citizen that just retired from his 16 months in the Army.  Paul is a believer in Marxism and throughout the film promotes the Worker's Party while denouncing US involvement in Vietnam, the Du Gaulle government and most forms of Westernism such as condoms, psychadelic rock (many songs in Masculin Feminin have a style similar to The Kinks, Jefferson Airplane etc) and even Coca-Cola... yet Paul is often seen playing pinball and that mini-bowling game you see at an arcade.  Paul seems to be the pro-French identity kind of guy as he often eats cheese and drinks wine.  The preserver of the romanticized French culture.    However, Paul's friends and interviewees (Paul works for the IFOP, the major French polling agency at the time) seem to not care about the change towards a quasi-American consumer state.  Paul's girlfriend Madelein is a rising pop-singer, her room mates are materialistic consumers, one who owns a car, and the people Paul interviews seem to only care about themselves.  This is very accurate in terms of how the 'baby-boom' generation of French youth began to rebel against the traditionalist governments in Europe.  Like the teens in the 1950s in the US, the teens began to form their own demographic.  However, this is where my fascination ends.  Godard apparently never heard of music editing and film editing.  In many parts in the movie, Godard fixed the camera on one person's face in a portrait shot and kept it there for minutes at a time even though the scene was a 15-minute back and forth conversation.  The volume in the music went from very high to very low instantly in many parts during dialogue, making it very annoying if almost distracting to the audience.    In a few parts when Paul was whistling, the recording of the whistling obviously overloaded the sound buffer as I heard static in the speakers.  I thought this was a volume problem on my end so I turned it down, nope... it was the sound editing.  This is just poor recording and editing.  Furthermore, the sound editors had this fascination with using the same gun-noise sound (which sounded more like a cartoon car noise) over and over and over again and in very unlikely times.    Other times, ambiant noises would drown out the dialogue such as vehicles from outside a cafe or even drinking noises.  Sometimes the sound didn't kick in for up to five seconds into the scene.    Because this is a French New Wave film, I won't attack how there is virtually no plot and has random scenes that are just plain silly.  However, I strongly recomend not getting this film if you're just in the general audience and not a New Wave fan.  Otherwise, you might like this New Wave classic but I'm no expert on the subject.  I was just extremely disapointed with the lazy filming, recording and editing.  
 The above entitled collection was a real disappointment. Not at all what I expected and definitely not worth the money. Quite frankly, I was so disappointed I threw them in the trash. I know there has to be good W.C. Fields films out there, however W.C. Fields: 6 Short Films-Criterion Collection is not one of them  Bill William 
 Hobsbawm's metaphysical system, communism, ultimately denies national sentiment.  So we can expect, and we do indeed receive, considerable attempts throughout the book to diminish, degrade and put down nationalism -- everything from the anti-intellectual argument that nationalism only began when the word "nation" appeared, to an exegesis of its evils in the 20th century.  This bias is made worse by high-handed, hypocritical lecturing at the end of the first chapter about how the social scientist is supposed to be "objective."  Phffft!  Eric is one of the last people in the world to lecture us on objectivity 
 I picked up this O'Conner book because every once in awhile I hear about her being "the definitive voice of the South" or "very disturbing" - I like disturbing and since I'm not overly familiar with the South, the definitive voice of it seems a good place to start.  But I just couldn't do it.  I read maybe 4 stories before I had to put it down for good.  I found the characterizations sophomoric and, well -- I suspect the overt, unsubtle, judgemental observations constantly being offered were snide parody, read in this day of self-consciousness they read like pandering to the lowest common denominator.  Timely, maybe.  Timeless, it's not 
 Hawthorne Heights is just a horrible and desperate attempt in trying to fit in with the whole emo trend. The lyrics are WAY to simple and pointless. This CD isn't completely horrible, but I would still reccommend that you buy another CD such as:   *Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge - My Chemical Romance *Define The Great Line - Underoath *Liberation Transmission - Lostprophets *Hours - Funeral For A Frien 
 My recommendation would be to read the Bible and leave Tim Lahaye alone. If you like, put a picture of Jesus, color and ethnicity your choice, on the wall. Feel good. Get Tim Lahaye's diabolical nonsense out of your life. Think about the friends you have, not the enemies. This man specializes in pointing fingers at people, known to God, but poorly understood by Tim Lahaye 
 After quite a while I finally put the time into reading this book and I am totally ambivalent whether I should have or not...I do not think that one should pay too much attention to those readers who do not take their history seriously, to those that want to propound a certain ideological agenda -- something I am realising has been,and is, a depressing fact of American socialisation. Those people of the ideological left will love this book and the those of the ideological right will hate it.... that is a given.   My question is this: What does Zinn have to say for the non-ideological historian? For the thinking and well considered historian, the person who well distilled in classic debates of history and the role of people, power and groups (classes?) in the grand scheme of things? What does Zinn have to say for those who were raised with a university education where the primary goal was to "display an adequate overview of all major acceptable views, and to show a mature understanding of those views?" -- not to argue just one side. American historiography has a broad tendency to degenerate into opposite truth camps of the right and left, mindlessly shouting out statistics, citing dates, supporting and dashing administrations to try to make a point. The entire pursuit of knowledge has been subverted by a kind of default to crude rhetoric for rhetoric's sake (see any American news programme or most prime-time columnists), and purile debate. Other countries and cultures shake their heads at such perversion of the whole idea of the way Americans understand history.    So do historians such as Zinn add to this atrophy of the brain or do they ammeliorate it? I am not so sure I know the answer. I am thinking that his whole style may betray an answer. Zinn's "radical" style is deliberately unbalanced, he makes no apologies for this, it is an attempt to right the largely unbalanced scales of history written by dominant elites, those who have and hold the power. This is a worthy ideal, but I am not so sure that a descriptive litany of abuse by those with power really says that much about an accurate interpretation of history. And if it does not, then what are people actually taking away from this book...?  Anyone who reads history, and I mean people who read a lot of history, will find Zinn to be more than just unbalanced, they will find him to be simplistic. I was caught up in his light drama (he writes well), in the same way as one reads a comic book... and then it dawned upon me... Zinn (like a left-wing version of Fox News reporting) writes as if history were a comic book. All evil on one side and all deprived and down trodden masses on by the other. For the considerate person looking for a higher understanding there will be an amazing sense of dissatisfaction, a feeling of being swindled. If one is trying to achieve social justice, there is a feeling of being swindled.   That may not be flattering for Mr. Zinn, but I got the distinct feeling that one was dealing with a light-weight in the area of history (some of his research is hard to check, he does not cite pages, and I sometimes wonder if he ever cracked an economic history textbook). He certainly would not be considered up there with the grand old man Hobsbawm (who is truly an intellectual joy to read -- and a leftist with common sense!!), or Lukas(another leftist) in his great tour-de-force "Big Trouble: A Study of Class in America." Zinn does not even rate compared with these historians.   So the question I return to is this.... for the considerate person of history, what does one get from this read? My conclusion is that besides some interesting vignettes on American inhumanity to man, or American inhumanity to American -- not much...Even if American history is imbalanced because the "majority" or mainstream history does not pay heed to the downtrodden, meeting diatribe with diatribe is neither a worthy nor reasonable approach -- moreover it is intellectually dishonest. Being biased, for whatever reason, is not something that historians, scientists, or social theoritst should TRY to be...   Historians must try to grasp a modicum of understanding through the haze of sources and alternative viewpoints. They must neither be hoodwinked by the codswallop of postmodernism or the absolute truth "certainty" of various right-wing historians. That is the challenge for the historian -- indeed it is the challenge for any thinking human being. If one wants to write comics that is a worthy endevour -- it is not however history. For a man of his age, he should know better!  *If you are thinking of reading this I would say that his writing style and capturing the drama is rather good, despite the fact that his sources (from the little I was able to check) are horrible.  
 I read everything. Trash to classics. This is a terrible book. I will quote Kurt Vonnegut:  When asked for advise on writing from a group of fledgling young authors, Vonnegut said, "If it doesn't advance the plot or build character development....throw it out. Be succinct."  I'm paraphrasing, but you get the idea.  Gilead is written in a manner that is the opposite of Vonnegut's advise.  Interesting characters? Zero in Gilead.   Interesting plot? Zero.  Ideas? Zero.  Wit? Less than zero.  Humor? Not a speck.  Don't waste your life with this drivel.   
 Unfortunately this MS collection is not compatible with European DVD players.  The cover of the DVD actually tells you this as well as that it is 'not for sale or rent outside the US and Canada'.  Save yourself a lot of trouble and don't buy this if you are from the EU! 
 This book was worthless to me and would be to anyone other than a Yoga instructor.  I have been doing Yoga for a year and was looking for a book that displayed a wider range of "exercises" with descriptions of each.  While this book does in fact show 608 poses, it does not provide any instruction on positioning.  I use Yoga to complement my weight lifting and long distance running and this book does not do this.  Having said this, a professional Yoga instructor probably would know exactly how to do each pose and just having a visual representation may be quite helpful.  I highly recommend "Journey into Power, How to shape your body, free your self, and transform your life" by Baron Baptiste.  Don't be scared by the esoteric nature of the title, for me it was very thorough on the exercise part of Yoga.  I don't know why these people insist on attempting to inculcate this psycho-babble on people that may just be looking for exercise and the benefits of the relaxation.  No offense intended 
 I've read all the previous Rita Mae Brown/Sneaky Pie Brown collaberations, so I was excited to see a new one at my local library.  Being a murder mystery fan and cat lover, I've truly enjoyed reading the series.  The best parts are the animals speaking (I love Pewter) and I have a special fondness for Mrs. Murphy because that's who I am (Mrs. Barbara Murphy).  I love Harry, and I don't mind that she's not at the post office anymore.  Her new adventures in grape growing and farming is who she really is--a country girl brought up on a farm.  But I have to say I also forced myself to keep reading this book assuming (hoping) that as I went further, the plot would get better.  I believe it took well over a 100 pages (or maybe it just seemed that long) to get to the "murder".  It also seemed that many of the "regular" characters were missing or barely mentioned especially Miranda, who is a big influence in Harry's life.  I think it was because of the way Ms. Brown went on and on about the biological terrorism, etc--it was like I was reading Time or Newsweek, not a fun, fictional murder mystery.  The winery settings and grape growing were interesting, but some of the conversations that took place between Fair and Harry, or Fair and BoomBoom about the diseases, etc. just didn't seem realistic.  As the story moved along, it did get a little easier to read, but I have to admit, for the first time, it was too obvious who did it and why.  I enjoyed the ending with all of the animals from the barn getting into the mix.  Well, I see another book is coming out early next year.  I'm still looking forward to reading it. 
 Young Ely Braxton (Marcus Thomas) is an up and coming rodeo bull rider who suffers a movie opening Serious Injury.  Brother Hank (Kiefer Sutherland) is the responsible older brother who raises bulls, teaches a zen-ish style of bull riding (`Empty your heart of hate before you ride,' that kind of thing) and is a rodeo clown - the fellow who distracts the bull after its thrown his rider and, reasonably enough from the bull's point of view, wants to crush into pulp the prone body of the thrown rider.   I've kind of made a point of searching out and watching rodeo movies.  There aren't a lot of them, and most concentrate on the maverick qualities of the rodeo rider.  Always a bull rider, by the way.  Most, too, feature some heavy hitters - guys like Steve McQueen and Cliff Robertson - in the lead roles.  COWBOY UP is a little different.  Bull riding is more of a backdrop here, a setting against which sibling rivalry, a search for a lost father, and some sticky romantic entanglements can be played out.  Not that we don't get a LOT of slow-motion shots of mucus draining bulls bucking and snorting and doing their best to toss and trample their tormenters (again, `tormenters' from the bull's point of view.)  It's just there's a whole lot more soap than horse in this opera.   Which wouldn't be so bad if the second lead, Marcus Thomas, was a polished actor.  Unfortunately his one expression seems to be that of stunned introspection, as thought on the first day of the shoot a crew member had asked him a preposterous question that he couldn't get out of his head.  Thomas is talking to a grip, say, on that first day, and the grip wonders out loud whether birds would have to fly if they had opposable thumbs. Thomas guffaws, of course, but every time the studio lights fire up the question returns to gnaw at him, and when he should be `in the moment,' or whatever it is actors say, with movie girlfriend Connie (Molly Ringwald,) instead he's picturing a southbound autumn highway with clusters of hitchhiking ducks.     I'm not sure it matters, anyway.  The story's kind of an ill-fitting hybrid to begin with.  Things become more complicated later when young Ely hooks up with pretty rodeo horse rider Celia Jones (Daryl Hannah,) brother Hank's old flame, which supplies just enough plot to propel the film to the grand finale.  Ely's search for his missing father is resolved, although that search was so unstressed in the movie I didn't even realize it was a Big Issue until it was on me.  And, of course, as in almost all rodeo movies, Ely gets to ride the big bull, preferably the one who threw him earlier.  In this case the big bull is Zapata, one of brother Hank's bulls, in fact.   I've never been a big fan of Kiefer Sutherland, but he's great in this one.  Ringwald, Hannah, and Melinda Dillon - the mother in both `Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and `The Christmas Story' - are wasted as sideline fodder who have little more to do than seduce or wring their hands and hope Ely gets some sense and give up the bull riding.  The highlight of the movie for me came when, while Hannah and Thomas were deep in their fling, Ringwald and Sutherland shared a piece of consolation pie at the local diner.  Ringwald, inevitably I guess, says to Sutherland, `In a different world you and I would have made a lot more sense.'  Hey, Molly - in a different and better movie you and Sutherland would have made a lot more sense, too.  	COWBOY UP might appeal to hard-core rodeo fans, but the rest of us would be better advised to steer clear of this one. 
 This book contains a good color wheel and some useful discussion about material, but that's about it.  The art is extremely idiosyncratic, stylized, and modern, and it is not very appealing.  What's more, it appears that the author only has command of one style/genre, and that won't be of much help people who are trying to learn.  Spend your money on The North Light Book of Acrylic Painting Techniques instead 
 I won't argue that there is some worthwhile stuff in here, and there are mentions of product names and websites that may prove useful. Many will even find the information presented worth the purchase price.  However, don't purchase this book thinking you are getting anything close to 400 pages of content. To begin with, there are many pictures, each using up half a page. That sounds good, right? Nope, the pictures show such things as an ethernet cable, a Dremel sanding bit, a picture of an extension cord and a pcture of how to use a measuring tape to measure a piece of Velcro.  More depressing, you get to look at these pictures several times, as well as read much of the content over and over. Each chapter is written as if there were no preceeding information, so you'll get to read the same information about the same products and techniques multiple times.  You know those little plastic plugs that go into A/C outlets to keep toddlers from poking pins in them? Did you need a description of them? How about a half-page picture of 4 of them artfully scattered on a table? How about multiple half-page pictures of them? How about for the extension cords, the sanding bits, etc.  I was expecting to get a 400 page book with 400 pages of information. It's nowhere near that. You may still find it worthwhile, but I found the repetition lame and unprecedented and personally resented being hoodwinked 
 Watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled. Boring and tacky even by horror standards, the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids' future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet, hence the title. I've seen far worse, but those worse movies were more "enjoyable" than this. The following morning you probably won't remember having seen it. If only the monster had eaten this movie's negative, then we would all be spared 
 These pillows end up being cardboard wafes when laid upon with your head, even when you have all four on top of each other.  This deal was too good to be true 
 I got the printer only to find that it doesn't come with a cord to connect it to your computer.  After wasting my time going to three different places, the cheapest one was for $50.  Amazon's advertisement that this is "free" with the purchase of a camera is misleading to say the least as it's not honest about the extra $$$$ you have to spend just for a connecting cord.  In my opinion, this has been very frustrating and a TOTAL RIPOFF! 
 Yes the pictures are great, but the captions are not well done.   We have a 1911 photo of Detroit's George Moriarty labeled as Ty Cobb (does anybody check this stuff?). In the same photo baseball's "Dark Prince" Hal Chase and Hall of Fame Umpire Tommy Connoly aren't even noticed by the author.  There is a picture of Honus Wagner "and his Pirate teamates..raise the flag on a new season..at Forbes Field..about 1910". Well it is Wagner, but the rest of this caption is wrong. It is in fact a June 1916 photo taken at the Baker Bowl in Philadelphia of Wagner and a few Pirates, but mostly Phillies, including overlooked Hall of Famers Pete Alexander and Dave Bancroft, raising a pennant to celebrate the Phillies' 1915 NL championship.  There are other likewise poorly captioned photos in this book.  Exactly what did the author contribute here? 
 One has to admire Wittig for persisting. _The Lesbian Body_ is an extended love letter from one Amazon (not an Amazon.com!) to the woman she loves. The book can have an intermittently disconcerting fascination, and it is agreeably off putting, with first person pronouns divided up ("m/e" [and in the French version "j/e"]), presumeably to break down language false to the lesbian self and the experience of love the book wishes to embody. Moreover, the attraction of the narrator for her inamorata is not confined to anything like usual romantic palaver; it can derive from, say, sweat. It is often expressed in violence. "Under m/y frantic pressure your head becomes detached at the level of the cervical vertebrae." I guess this is love, if between consenting adults.  I don't find the new language _more_ satisfactory or illuminating; it is just different, for the sake being so, nor for me does feminizing the characters in the _Iliad,_ as _The Lesbian Body_ does, add to an understanding of them or make the stories alluded to more moving, entertaining, true, or, given the sketchiness of the references, much unlike what they were in Homer.  Interrupting the paeans of love, at apparently arbitrary points, are lists of body parts, often sounding like extracts from a medical textbook. "THE DORSALS THE ILIACS THE TERES THE QUADRATI." Is this the inevitability of the phsyical? Or a remaking of love in a way the outside, non-revolutionary world will or must find foreign?  The best that can be said about this experiment is that, like the writing of Gertrude Stein, it can shake the reader out of traditional ideas of fiction or writing and bust up stale social notions. By the last page, 165, I had had enough. It was actually more fun to write this review than to read the book 
 De Soto's work was viewed by economists, historians, and politicians alike as breakthrough.  He gives us an in-depth look at the Lima's informal sector and postulates, much to the satisfaction of his Washington, D.C.  bankroll, that Peruvians are bursting to embrace democracy and market  capitalism.  Unfortunately, he has twisted Peru's real scenario to reflect  what Washington wants to hear.  In reality, Lima's informal sector is  merely a way for a depraved population to survive, not a radical shift  toward capitalism.  De Soto's Institue for Liberty and Democracy was funded  almost in full by Washington, and the man himself has spent more time in  the U.S. than in Peru.  This book leans more toward American propaganda  than objective analysis.  An interesting read, but only with abundant  grains of salt 
 THIS WAS THE MMOST BORING BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS TO ANYBODY.IT IS CONFUSING AND DID I MENTION BORRING.   P.S. MS.D PLEASE DON'T TAKE OFF MY GRADE SPELLING ERRORS  SIGN_  THE BOY WHO DIDN'T LIKE STORY TIM 
 Being a bookseller, I often fall on nice book covers (dustcovers). Not that I judge a book by his cover but what can we do if they look very good? Tempted we are! This one really catched my eye and the story briefly explained on it made me buy it. Here we go! Now. Reading began in earnest. Going through it became a sad tale. Finishing it was expeditive. Then... What happened Mr Mosley? Got fed up while writing it? Your idea was truly marvelous but why going in every direction? Poor 47 must have had to run truly fast to follow you. Fictious tales of slavery should be read by young people (why not?) and giving it a science-fiction/magic twist... well, why not? Remember that science-fiction must be a context as real as slavery if it should be believable.  No young adult will be able to read that... I will not judge this author by the only book I read from him either, but I'll stay with history books to learn on African-Americans 18/19th Century sufferings and Star Trek for sci-fi, thank you. :((( Maybe a shorter version read by the great Ossie Davis could make me like it... 
 It stinks.  The 2 mass murderers are depicted as poor victims of society.  They're cocky and stupid in the show.  The movie puts Pinkerton in bad light.  Of course cocky and stupid people will enjoy loathing him.  Bad acting all around.  
 Far too religious for me.  I do not think this book presents a healthy way to respond to grief 
 _State and Revolution_ is a complicated book in the annals of Marxist thinking. Lenin assigns above all a class role to the State, and therefore ascertains correctly the necessity of a socialist state assuming a proletarian viewpoint. At the same time, Lenin's socialist state lacks a truly political dimension, as it remains, above all, a means for strictly administrative decision-making. Something that would gravely hamper the subsequent understanding of the political character of a future socialist state, specially when you think that this book was written while Lenin hid from the Kerensky government, that's to say just before the October Revolution. Neverthless, the problems put by the book have enormous present value. Therefore it must be taken as entirely questionable the decision to choose as translator an anti-communist like Service, something that would be quite like choosing a neo-stalinist to translate Trotsky's "Revolution Betrayed" 
 i fell asleep watching it, it's horrible. i do not recommend it, not worth watchin 
 My one star rating is for Amazon's service, not the WaterPik attachment, which I never received.  Despite the fact that I ordered this on 20 February 2007 and shipping was stated to be 7-9 days (and is still stated to be 7-9 days), TWO weeks later Amazon has contacted me that shipping on this item will not be until 5-9 April 2007.  I have canceled the item and ordered from another internet store and should receive this in a few days.  In my many years ordering from Amazon, I have found it's best not to order any items with any type of shipping delay, as shipping almost always takes far longer than promised.  I don't understand why Amazon can't keep better track of their inventory 
 Please save your money! The so called "Heroine" was so annoying I sided with the bad guy. Enough said. 
 This toy is a piece of junk. Every five seconds something is breaking, and once you get it open it's nearly impossible to get it back together. Purely junk 
 I think maybe I'm not hip enough to like this CD.  I really want to like it.  I've listened to it several times.  I'm trying really hard to figure out what he's trying to say.  Maybe I'm not deep enough.  So many people are saying this is such a great CD and so much like his first one.  Huh?  I understood the first one.  This one, not so much.  I read the reviews trying to find out what I'm missing and still I don't get it.  Maybe I should find the lyrics and then I'll understand what he's saying.  I'm hoping it will grow on me and maybe '9 Crimes' is starting to, but the others not so much.  Overall, a big disapointment.  
 Once again a conservative minister with traditional views thinks women needed a man to not only think FOR them...but to tell us what WE are actually thinking!!!!! If you want to know what wives wish their husbands knew, ask a real wife. If you want to enhance your traditional conservative marriage, this book is for you. Otherwise, not good for modern couple 
 When I use to read BD novels I really felt like she understood people.  This latest book is out churned formula writing about a long gone alcoholic viewed through the eyes of a snobby self important writer and her misery at returning home.  The switch of view points from first person to third was annoying and I found it hard to like / understand any of the characters.  Save yourself the money and skip this total waste of time 
 Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"  This is one of those books.   Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.   Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.   And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much 
 This product didn't make a difference in the volume control on my television! 
 Clear And Present Danger is OK at points, but the rest of the novel is boring with the CIA work, the action between the Commandos don't feel realistic, the story drags on on for hundreds of pages, the boring details of how big a ship is, that is boring! If you want to read a REAL and exciting novel, read Bob Mayer's Eyes Of The Hammer. Bib Mayer is a former Special Forces officer, the action is there, and is VERY EXCITING unlike this book where you have to go through hundreds of pages to get to the action. 
 I liked it better than the Hour Game, which was so slow I never finished it.  Baldacci has unfortunately, like other authors gotten a little preachy.  They disguise it as part of the story (as if their readers don't see it) but there are whole sections that flash "Author's Message" in neon lights.  First, there are much subtler ways to send a message, second, I just don't like being preached at no matter if I agree or disagree with the message.  I stopped reading Tom Clancy (opposite view) for just this reason 
 Phyllis Chesler shares what she perceives as an alarming new trend among leftwing groups. However, the groups that merit alarm for becoming newly, or in reality more visibly anti-Semitic, have always relied on antagonism and violence for motivation. Workers should hate their bosses, women should hate men, blacks should hate whites, etc. We're not talking about hatred in the abstract, but deep-bred hatred that calls for action, strife and turmoil. Someone please correct me, but it sounds as though the author was all for the "movement" as long as the hatreds were directed the way she prefers. Now that the beast has unleashed a little fury towards her group, she doesn't appear to have second thoughts about the worthiness of her causes, but rather she sounds as though she wishes that she could direct the hate back to where she would prefer it to go. Also, I found the writing extremely flawed in many places. And, there don't appear to be references to back-up all the allegations of "terrorism", i.e. many acts appear to be random criminal violence that just happened to involve Jews. My sympathies to those people, but all of us are faced with such incidents 
 This movie has some great moments that give one hope for what it could have been.  Emma Thompson in particular shines in her role as the candidate's wife.  However a terribly hokey script full of over-the-top metaphors about the moon and wild boars, characters who are too underwritten to win the empathy of the audience, a running time that's 45 minutes longer than it needs to be and a really, really, REALLY bad score (Seriously the worst I've heard in a major studio release film -- it sounds like a ten-year-old's piano recital or something.) sink this movie into the bottom of the commercial stratosphere.    Most disappointing of all are the two characters the audience is supposed to have the most empathy for.  There's Libby, played by Kathy Bates, whose character trajectory is unbelievably manipulative.  Sadly I can't be more specific about this without spoiling a major plot "twist" -- suffice it to say that filmmakers try to manipulate you into feeling something for both her and her cause -- not through good writing, but through an action that it made little sense for her to take.  Then there's Henry Burton, the campaign manager through whose eyes we see all of this.  His innocence and idealism are supposed to be challenged over and over again but the screenplay never presents him with any real moral delimmas.  Instead he gets just a lot of sad music playing over soft-focus close-ups, a completely unresolved subplot with his girlfriend, a background involving him being the grandson of a civil rights leader that is never delved into and a character that is never fully developed.  When the credits roll, we still have no idea who he is and what it is he stands for -- and the same can be said of this entire movie.  The DVD has no extras to speak of, just production notes and a trailer that make it hardly worth having a DVD instead of a video.  Characters in this movie talk a lot about the importance of making history.  The true events it's based on did, in fact, make history.  (The fact that this film is actually a fictionalization of the Clintons is no secret.)  But at this point, I think it's safe to say that this is one aspect of the Clinton administration even Democrats don't want to revist, so there's little hope of nostalgia ever saving this movie from the only spot in history it has managed to earn: the ash heaps 
 This is a good book for fantasy or romance readers.  Have you ever seen The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston?  This novel has lots of interactions reminiscent of that movie...muscular, sweaty single dimensional men grabbing women by the shoulders and booming dialogue into their faces....beautiful, single-dimensional women melting in their arms... If you enjoy historical fiction and are looking for a more authentic historical novel, try reading Sharon Kay Penman 
 That's what you get when you buy this book. The book simply reprints the same material you get in the DISC instrument. There is nothing, nothing, new here. There is no insight, no detail, no discussion on how to use the information. I use DISC constantly in my business and found this book a total waste. If you want to understand DISC go to www.discinsights.com and get their home study program. It's terrific, detailed, and provides lots of examples. I also recommend the book "The 4-Dimensional Manager." Still not as good as the above reference but at least it's worth the money. 
 This author is certainly not the best writer. The story was dull and so was the writing. It was predictable with no twists. I was disappointed. NOT a pageturner 
 Some time in the future, historians will look back on the 2nd half of the 20th Century and wonder what spurred an otherwise enlightened society to lap up dreck like _Against Our Will_ as though it actually had any merit.   It is difficult to imagine that the author actually intended to enlighten anyone with this bombastic, stilted, sophomoric garbage. The Feminazis who will read this are already convinced that men are the root of all evil. Open-minded women with a shred of intelligence and critical thinking will recognize the arguments as spurious, the vocabulary as inflammatory and the "evidence" contrived to support pre-determined points. I can only conclude that the author intended to provoke and titillate, much like Jose Canseco's recent tell-all.  The quality of research that went into this book rivals that of an Oliver Stone film or a 9/11 conspiracy film. Apart from being an excellent example of poor journalism, the main value of this book is that it will help fill up the "men are pigs" section of your library.  Save your money for horoscope readings or something else more credible 
 I have found that most tribute albums are lame and why not just listen to the original.This one is just awful. But there are exceptions.  So when I first heard about the project of a tribute to Grover Washington , I thought how do you cover God, because Grover was like a God to contemporary jazz.  WOW! What an album! OK, nobody had to write any songs on this, but they all put their own spin on each song and did a fabulous job.  Jason Miles produced this fresh off two grammy nominees for his 2000 release tribute CD to Ivan Lins ( Sting won for his version of "She Walks This Earth" while Grover was nominateed for "Cameleo " ).  First the lineup is just stellar: Regina Belle , Gerald Albright, Russ Freeman, Ronnie Laws with Sounds Of Blackness, Herbie Mann, Tom Schuman and Jeff Mironov, Dave Koz, Everette Harp, Steve Cole, George Duke, Mark Whitfield, Richard Elliot, Jay Beckenstein with Dean Brown, Paul Taylor with Peter White, Chuck Loeb with Dave Mann, Chaka Khan, Greg Philinganes with the New York Philharmonic String Section, and Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Joe Sample with Joey Defrancesco.  If you'd pick up an album with all of these guys on it and it wasn't all Grover tunes you'd buy it! In fact you'd probably have a huge grin on your face and tell half the store about your lucky find on the way to the cash register. So now imagine all these guys playing their version of all these great Grover tunes like: "Just The Two Of Us" , "Winelight", " East River Drive" , "Inner City Blues ", " Come Morning " , " Let It Flow" and more.  I can see you smiling and saying yeah I'd buy it and you should. " To Grover , with Love " is magnificent ! It's good. It's great.  It's deadly gorgeous !!  
 I have been a fan of Western Digital hard drives for many years, but that ended with this product.  I purchased an Essential Edition 250GB drive for my daughter as a Christmas gift, by New Years it was DOA.  Giving WD the benefit of the doubt, I exchanged it for an identical replacement.  This one made it until early March.  Three clicks and it turns off.  WD says there is nothing I can do but return it under a RMA.  They can do nothing about the lost data.  So much for using this drive for backing up important files.  I've have had at least a dozen WD drives over the years and never had a failure, they just became obsolete because of their size.  This produce however....STAY AWAY 
 The year was 1990, the sound was "new jack swing"...R&B laced with hip-hop..the group was Bell, Biv, Devoe..3 former members (Ronnie Bivins, Ricky Bell, Mike Devoe) split off from New Edition, the hugely successful R&B "boy band" of the 80s. The band racked up a quick 6 Top 100 Billboard hits and then disappeared from the charts.  HIGHLIGHTS: The title track is far and away the best song here and the only hit that still sounds pretty fresh. The group moves from strength to strength with sharp hip-hop beats, occasional harmony, and a really funky break (after "Blow!"). Outside of that, the album track "Ain't Nuttin' Changed" is a nice slice of old school hip-hop with a Sly and the Family Stone sample to boot.   LOWS: "Do Me!" was a big hit back when, but the junior high locker room ideas about sex are pretty boring to me in my 30s (it's no "Let's Get it On"). "Word to the Mutha" and "I Do Need You" don't really go anywhere musically.  BOTTOM LINE: This band was definitely a singles act, you don't really need the album unless you're a diehard fan who wants the extended remix of the title track and album track "Ain't Nuttin' Changed" which is also pretty tough. Outside of that, all the hits can be found on the "20th Century Masters:Millennium Edition" (ASIN B000066F0S) or if you really only want "Poison","B.B.D.", and "Do Me!" you might go for New Edition's "All the Number Ones" (ASIN B00004T0EB) which gives you those 3 tracks plus several big 80s hits from their old band 
 For the price, I shouldn't complain, but what the heck?  What ever happened to quality control?  It came double shrink wrapped.  There was a plastic handle guard that didn't fit the sword, so I had to just throw it away.  Very little pride in the product.  The wood was roughly sanded before it was painted.  Well, it's just a stick afterall.  I'm just glad I did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor, DreamObjects.  Read their feedback responses -- sounds a lot like aggressive Ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback.  Sorry -- waste of my time and a few dollars.  I gave them a 4 out of 5 feedback simply because you can't tell quality from a single digital photo 
 When i first bought these things they were awesome and really cute.  i loved the volume control they isolated noise pretty well just not wind but for the price i guess one can't expect much. all of a sudden the right ear just stopped working.  i only had them for about a month and i wish i kept the receipt or the box maybe i could've had some sort of reimbursement but I'll never know hopefully everyone else has better luck with thos 
 I have had a Canon G2 since 2002. I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem. In October 2004, I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon. I did not use it until this summer. After I had taken 20 more photos and reviewed, I immediately found a few images corrupted. No matter how I tried, e.g. format the CF before use, there were alway corrupted images.  I wonder if I can return the defect CF card and get a replacement from Amazon or from manufacturer?  Sherwood  L.A. count 
 This does not have the range that it states it does.  I even called their customer service person and asked about this and agreed with me.  Maybe useful for people in the city near a tower, other wise it is pretty useless 
 I have the Proper Care and Feeding of husbands and I enjoyed that book.  Woman Power is full of blank pages for you to write your thoughts and ideas. I think it is a waste of time unless you just LOVE to journal.  If you took the useful information and took out the blank pages the book is about 2 chapters.  My advice is to put your money to better use at Victorias Secret.  Your husband will get a lot more out of it!! 
 Beattie sort of touches on behaviors/experiences that many of us can relate to. I don't think we'd interpret these things in the way that she does (nor give them the managable labels she does), but it does feel good to have these hard-to-define things explained to us by someone who speaks like she knows what she's talking about. I think that causes many of us to accept her interpretation of things and accept her as an expert on the subject. But Beattie, in her affected authoritative tone, rambles all over the place, and it can cause your mind to feel disoriented and confused. And this confused state of mind you fall into while reading her words helps to conceal how Beattie consistently contradicts herself throughout the book. After the first 100 pages or so I felt dizzy at all the confusion she'd stirred in me. Or maybe SHE didn't stir anything up in me - I'm a codependent victim. Sheesh. I think the good feelings this engenders in people is due to people relating to a lot of the same gripes as Beattie. It's nice to see our problems in print - it gives us hope for a solution to these problems. But the good feelings end there. Beattie does more damage than good. The one message that blasts loud and clear out of this book is CARE FOR NO ONE BUT YOURSELF. But then she says that caring for people is good. But don't do it. But you can still love them. But don't. This appears to be a book written by a conflicted woman who obviously has issues, and decided to put in print the neurosis that helped her to cope with these issues. It just makes me feel bad that people may try to implement her ideas/advice in their lives to the destruction of their good relationships. She's advocating being alone -"undependent" of anyone - and taking the "necessary" steps to detach from these relationships. Some abusive relationships may need such severing, but Beattie casts the label of "codependent" under a wide enough umbrella to cover everyone. "Everyone's codependent." So good relationships will be destroyed by following her advice, as well as bad ones. I think that down the road many people who follow her advice and alienate the people who love them in their effort to be "undependent" and "detached" will feel a deeper pain than the one that caused them to pick up this book in the first place. And then they'll just be confused as to why they're unhappy - they did just what Beattie said.  It pains me to know that this book is in print. I'm sorry for everyone's individual pain and I hope you find something to soothe it. This book, at best, is destruction disguised as hope 
 When I bought the book I did not know that they already made a movie out of it but I learned about it later on. So I was really excited when I started to read it - also because other comments were really good. Unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations at all.  First the story development is really slow- it takes an awful lot of pages before the actual crime happens.  Second, several passages in the book do not contribute anything vital at all to the story but only slow down the pace significantly.  The worst part of the book though is its style: It does not matter if a person really contributes anything at all to the story or the crime - he/she gets an extensive characterization. Most of them are several pages long and bore the hell out of the reader. Without this absolutely unnecessary amount of information this book easily could be about 200 pages shorter.  But even if the pace is slow and the book should be shorter, couldn't it still be an interesting book? Unfortunately those of you who hope to find a decent crime story will be disappointed big time as well. The detective aspect is so simple it could be told in less than 100 pages. On top of that the solution to the crime is so simple that after the first clue you know who the murderer is - and wonder why you need to go through over 200 pages to find out officially.  Conclusion: If you are a psychologist and/or like in-depth character studies this is exactly the right book for you. BUT for those of you who like fast-paced stories, ample twist and turns, surprises, action, thrilling developments and/or elaborate detective stories this book will be an absolute waste of your time. Please do not come anyway near it. Watch the movie instead - this way you will see some really great actors and are over with it in 2 hours 
 If you liked Michael Eric Dyson's other works then you will love this.  It is essentially his standard "blame Amerika" rant with the words New Orleans, and Hurricane Katrina thrown in to render the work germane.  The interesting thing about this book is how quickly it was published after Katrina.  Given the length of time required to get a manuscript onto bookshelves, I calculated that he must have written this in the two weeks following the storm. Given that some of the "facts" he cites about Katrina can be shown empirically to be false, perhaps he should have waited just a little longer before jumping into the fray.    Another  blow to Dyson's neo-Marxist take on Katrina is the  Knight Ridder news story released  in December (2006) that showed the pattern of death and to a certain extent destruction did NOT occure on racial/class lines as Dyson would have us believe also casts doubt on his narrative (for example, as a percentage of population, there was a stronger correlation between age and death than race and death. If those found dead in nursing homes were factored out, as a percentage of population, more white people than black died. Can we then surmise that George Bush hates old white people? The main stream media, with few exceptions, did not pick up on this story because like Dyson, they had already decided the Katrina narrative and they are not about to let the facts ruin a juicy story.)  Those of you who know Dyson's work of course will know that he was probably chomping at the bit from day one to throw his opinion into the mix.    Anyone who followed the coverage of Katrina probably heard various religious figures blaming the evil nature of New Orleans for incurring god's wrath.  Offensive as these views may be, I was surprised that Dyson - a writer who is considered to be a first rate accademic by many - would wast a whole chapter refuting such arguments.  In fact, by even arguing against these positions he is giving them more credence than they deserve.  If any book about Katrina is to be taken seriously, it probably should not contain a whole chapter on the pros and cons of various theological interpretations of the disaster.  True, the author is an ordained minister but perhaps he should leave his views on divine retribution in the pulpit where they belong (it is also ironic that given Dysons neo-Marxist critical approach to race, etc. that he would even counternance the notion of god. let alone engage in the arguments he does here.)  So, if you are a fan of Dyson's, buy this book - you will be neither disappointed nor challenged (because you already know what he is going to say.) If you are interested in the state of contemporary leftist "academic" thought then this is a good read because it is far more accessible than the works of many of Dyson's peers yet encapsulates the narrow race/class/power/gender optic through which they view capitalism in general and of course this most wicked of nations, Amerika. 
 This is the second HD DVD that I've had issues with the XBox360 player, the other being Children of Men. Ironically, both are dual format. While Children of Men refused to play, this one refuses to go past chapter 12. I've had no issues with my PS3 playing any of the Blu-Ray movies so it begs the question, what is wrong with this format? I've got another dual format HD DVD/DVD disk that I'm going to try. Anyhoo, if you're using the XBox360 HD DVD player, this movie might not play all the way for you or might not even play at all 
 You have got to be kidding me. This stuff was tacky when it ran in magazines...  so now a book of it? Whatev... not to mention the horribly CHEAPO paper and way crummy binding. What was the guy thinking? Filthy lucre, I suppose. Three to six months until it hits the remainder table. A better subtitle might have been, "How I Stopped Worrying About What a Decent Book Should Be". Save  yourself the bread 
 The book has a certain zany energy to it, but the plot is inane and the writing is incredibly corny.  I couldn't even listen to it as an audio book.  If you're interested in the Japanese underworld read Barry Eisler's John Rain series instead 
 Ridiculous, convoluted and unresolved plot with main characters that have become predictable and boring.   Did Cornwell even write this one herself? If so, she missed a glaring discrepancy when she proofread: On page 216 Marino remembers Mrs. Paulsson greeting him at the door "wearing jeans and a soft pink sweater", but later when he tells Scarpetta what happened during his visit to the house he describes her as having worn black books and a camouflage shirt when she opened the door.  Perhaps it was the author's attempt to let readers think Marino only imagined the pink sweater scenario because he was too ashamed to remember what really happened. However, to this reader it comes across simply as a mistake the author forgot to go back and correct 
 This book is sadly a one sided story.  As a former intelligence officer now turned business professor, I know for a fact that the book does not tell of the U.S.'s own actions in manipulating and degrading the services provided by the UN.  If fact, it could be argued that the U.S. sabotages its own security by not properly supporting the UN, especially when it gallivants off on unilateral crusades that have international ramifications.  Just a few points: first, the UN is currently (it will not last forever) the strongest power in the UN and does not hesitate to throw its weight around and bully others; and second, the U.S. has not morale ground to stand on right now when accusing others of scandal.  All told, the author has done a poor job of presenting and researching the facts.  However, he has done what those from Fox do best, presented a sensationalized overly one-sided pro-American view.  It is most unfortunate that many Americans will take the information presented in this book at face value and ultimately remain ignorant of the truth.   
 I can only say that the effort was obvious but the information was hard to use.The research was solid but lacked common usage for slugs like me 
 I bought this blender because I liked its retro design, and I thought it would function well.  Well, every single time I've tried to use it has been a disaster.  Even for very simple tasks, like blending soft avocado, the blender has not worked. The blades spit big chunks onto the sides of the glass jar and then spin around without blending anything... It's horrible.  And I even threw away my old, ugly blender when I bought this one... and the other worked just fine. :  
 The plot in Final Analysis is trite and overused and the characters are flat and stock. Tedious and painful to read 
 This is supposed to be a good book, a life changing book, but its a hard read. A hard read. I find it boring myself. 
 This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste. 
 Chang has written a lot of books on various subjects.  I don't know how they sell, but the two that I have read, this one and Continuous Process Improvement Tools ('93) are just too basic for effective use.  A beginner book, no more.  At the end of each chapter, the author includes a page or two of checklists and questions, which, combined with the generous use of whitespace, take the place of more substantive content, which could have been included.  But then many of the people reading this for introduction to CPI would probably have put it down.  A much better book on the subject is Principles of Total Quality, by Omachonu & Ross.  It is a near-textbook quality treatment of TQM which is readable by the novice as well as more expert individuals 
 It's been a while since I bashed the Eagles, so I thought I'd get back in action. Anyway... Three of the most annoying Top 5  ihts of the '70's can be found on this disc: the title track, a crappy uptempo/pseudo-dance song that's even more annoying than Hotel California; the brainless Lyin' Eyes; and especially the sophoric, overly-orchestrated Take it To the Limit. I don't know how ANYBODY can put up with this group, but if I hear one more Eagles hit on the radio.. 
 This movie is strickly for the women now I see why it was made for the lifetime channel. It was hard for me(as a man)  to watch this show knowing that there are people out there like these characters.  I was looking for a happy ending and didn't get it.  
 I never even traveled with it. It just stopped working completely making me lose data.  NEVER AGAIN I'll buy anything from this company. This drive is a piece of rubbish! 
 I beg to differ with the other reviewers.  For summer reading at my school, they assigned this book and the much more interesting and riveting book, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.  White Lilacs, though, was an awful book with a pointless plot that isn't good enough to write an entire novel about.  I mean, sure, "slavery is evil" to many but this book was sooooooooooo stupid!  DO NOT buy this book unless you are extremely bored and are on your deathbed.  or see for yoursel 
 I ordered this book sight-unseen, having been a big fan of Jim Phillips' skateboard art when I was a teenager. But ultimately, when it arrived I found it to be a real disappointment.   Almost none of the art is reproduced from the originals. Skate stickers, for example, are all printed from the stickers themselves, as far as I can see, with little attempt to clean them up for print. I counted exactly one picture of a work in progress. Plus, they seem to be trying to create the "comprehensive" book of Phillips' art (despite not having access to any of it), so they chose quantity over quality. As in, there's a million zillion pieces of art in the book, all reproduced at about 15% size. I'm not kidding -- there are entire twelve-page comics he drew reprinted here, where all 12 pages are laid out on A SINGLE PAGE OF THE BOOK, almost completely illegible. Bummer.   Much of the rest of the page space is taken up with this long, rambling essay about the artist's life. There's little discussion about art technique, influences or inspiration; most of it is about Phillips' experiences in Santa Cruz, hanging out with people, going to shows and surfing. I've lived in Santa Cruz. I'm sure he had a fun time and all, but it's not a very interesting life to read about. Needless to say, I couldn't get more than a few paragraphs into the saga, even though it often dominates entire pages, with drawings crammed into the margins at maginfying-glass defying size, like some high school kid's doodles.   The editor seemed more interested in some of Jim Phillips' rock posters for the Maritime Hall than he was with the skate stuff, because some of those are reprinted fairly well, on full pages. Strange choice of emphasis, though, for a book that places the "screaming hand" (Phillips' most instantly-recognizable iconic image) on the front cover.   You'll notice that Amazon lists this book's author as Jim Phillips. I doubt the man himself had anything to do with putting  it together. This accredation is just to make up for the strange omission of an author's name. Nobody is credited with this book at all, that I could find. The overall impression is that it was either a fan's scrap-book labor of love, or just slapped together for a quick buck. Phillips' art deserves a better treatment 
 Ever wonder for which bipolar monomaniac the Sorcerer's Apprentice worked? Now you know. Drier than Dryden, boot-licking admirer of the thief of his childhood, humorless bookworm of a dusty aristocrat, protonerd ex machina in extremis. When Continent-lazing navel-gazers concern themselves with improving society, oil your firearms. I'd rather a deep belly laugh than Mill's musings, any day 
 If you're from the Boston area, and you haven't read at least a couple of Spencer novels,  you're missing a cultural icon.  Boston and environs are as much a star as the erudite ex-boxer turned detective, Spencer.   This is the 30th book of the Spencer series, and it's tired and formulaic.  There's no real tension, the ending isn't particularly surprising (or interesting).  It's not clear to me if the characterizations would hold at all if you hadn't read some of the other Spencer books.  Maybe it's time for Spencer to retire 
 The cable worked. That's about it. The software provided did not work, and it did not include the VX8300 model?! There was no contact information for the manufacturer, and I spent hours upon hours finding an appropriate driver, plus I had to find software to use this thing 
 For the record I have never bought one of these pieces of junk they try to pass off as music and never WILL!!!! I hope you are all happy! You've officially tainted some of the best music ever with your high pitched pre-puberty voices! Yellow Submarine can never and shouldn't have ever been done by anyone but THE BEATLES!!!!!!!!! in the future please leave the singing to those peoples with some taste and artistry! Who is the guy trying to be Ual Mc Cartney in Here comes the sun! I normall ysing this song to make myself feel better: but now I'll only be able to think of those freakishly squeaky voices!GOOD JOB(I only gave it a star because my review wouldn't have been put up if i didn't 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I liked only the tracks 1 and 6. The songs have good banjo picking but are not beautiful enough to keep me listening more than one time 
 Janet Evanovich is my absolute all time favorite author, which is why I'm heartbroken over this book. I have never read an Evanovich book I didn't like until now. I literally finished the book only because Janet wrote it.   The book pretty much goes like this: steal a hauler, Beans is kidnapped, follow people around, get Beans back, follow more people around, Gobbles is kidnapped, follow some more people around, Hooker is kidnapped(my favorite part, who likes a cheater!), follow even more people around, etc, etc... Wish I had a nickel for every car they tailed in this book. I also agree with the other reviewers, Beans the dog got on my nerves pretty quick.   I'm still a huge fan of the Stephanie Plum series. I can't wait for the next Plum book in January. I just wish Janet would have spent her time working on the next Plum novel instead of wasting everyones time with Motor Mouth.  
 We bought this for our son for Christmas this year based on glowing reviews. What a disappointment! The "musical instruments" are basically glorified rattles that all sound basically the same, the song the drum plays is tinny, scratchy, and short, and nothing seems very well made. I at least expected the different instruments to sound different from one another.   On the plus side, it is cute, and the lobster has a pretty wind chime like sound 
 If you are looking for a book that will teach you a lot about real estate and home inspections then this is not the book for you. The chapter information and text content of this book was very basic and did not teach me anything I didn't already learn from other books that were much better. Inspecting homes is something I have done for many years and I would not recommend this book to any customers or contractors. If you know absolutely nothing about real estate then you might learn a few things but not too much 
  Ironic that a novel by a writer who despised penny pinching and greed would have his novel published in such a way that to make a few more bucks the publisher makes the book literally painful to read.   The text is simply too crammed on the page, following lines of text is awkward and the lack of spacing simply makes the book painful to read.   Theres other editions of the book that are cheaper and properly spaced. What a disappointment this edition is. Shame on Signet for this ridculousness 
 I can't count how many glowing reviews I've read for this book.  I've come to the conclusion that those reviewers never actually read through the book.  Let me continue by saying that I got this book for a gift and, while I appreciate the thought, I feel awful about accepting it because it is hands-down, the worst book published since the dawn of Anglo-Western democratic civilization.   My first beef involves his name.  Susur.  Buddy, no one knows who you are so quit signing with only your first name.  Madonna is the only one that can get away with that, and even she is a washed-up hag.  The first "book" is just some pretentious blather about his life.  It's not even interesting.  No one had heard of this guy before he wrote the book, and that's because he hasn't done anything worth noting.  The actual recipe book is an abortion.  The recipes are all so incredibly complex, and require so much money that the only way someone is going to complete one is if they have: 1) too much time 2) too much money (you might actually have to sell your children to afford a recipe; I hear slave-trade brings in the most cash); and 3) Obsessive Compulsive Disorder  Now I consider myself a pretty able chef (The French Laundry is one of my favorites), but I'm pretty sure that even Iron Chef Morimoto would get acid reflux reading this book.  "Complex" doesn't even begin to describe the recipes.  Actually, I'm pretty sure that there isn't a word in any of the European languages that illustrate the preposterous amounts of effort required to complete a dish.  If I went to a restaurant that offered a menu such as the one in Susur, I would get up and leave, and return fifteen minutes later with a jerrycan of gasoline, and a tub of motor oil and I would burn it to the ground.   Cocoa Squab Liver Pate with Taro Fritters Egg and Caviar Creme Fraiche and Honey Mustard Sauce?  Puh-lease, if that doesn't sound like latent homosexuality, I don't know what does.  If you're too lazy to read the stuff I wrote above let me SUMMARIZE:  - I would pay more money to contract Hepatis C than I would for this book.  I hope this review was helpful 
 This movie was boring, confusing and seemed pointless.  After her boyfriend is shot and killed in a convenience store, Courtney Cox goes through a difficult adjustment which includes a blur of reality and fantasy. We see her remembering the incident several different ways. Now, reading this description it would sound like the movie is intriguing and would be interesting but it isn't. With a premise that has potential the writer and director manage to create a dark, confusing and (worst of all) completely uninteresting movie. I was amazed that it was under 80 minutes because it seemed soooo much longer. I felt no connection with any of the characters, and found Courtney Cox's character the least engaging of all. The characters seemed two dimensional and the plot (if you can call it that) was pointless. By the end I just didn't care what really happened. Skip this one 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 Zacharias' poorly organised arguments never really address the core logic of atheism but rather attacks atheists for, at worst, imagined agendas, and at best for not taking the Pascalian wager (that it's better to gamble on God's existence than otherwise),  arguments which were much better placed forward by Blaise Pascal himself.  Modern theists of the foundationalist sort (as opposed to Catholic theologians, most of whom are better debaters) never really get to the heart of the debate, i.e., the logical critique of theism. Contemporary arguments for the existence of God like these are more deeply flawed than in ancient times (when the absence of scientific knowledge made it more difficult to debate). The postulated existence of a supreme being, for example, has empirically verifiable consequences that are never borne out.   RZ never anticipates atheistic rebuttals to theistic speculation, further exposing his impotence as a debater. I was hoping he might at least propose some answers to the 2300-year-old riddle of Epicurus: "Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"   Virtually every one of God's supposed attributes (omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, omnibenevolence) when considered in conjunction, show his alleged existence to be self-contradictory and thus makes the existence of a supreme being not only improbable (given evidential considerations), but rather impossible (given logical considerations).   
 The reason for the low rating is the lack of any subtitles on the boxset and Amazon's mistake in the product description. Folks, all seasons of this series are shipped in DVDs with no subtitles and no closed-caption. 
 I felt sorry for my daughter this past Summer. She picked this book out of a list of 5 to read for school. The writing was all over the place, the plot went nowhere. Really boring. zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...... 
 The instuctions were simply too complicated and hard to follow, you really NEED an instructor to do this kind of exercise, which explains why about 1/2 the book is a list of studios and teachers.  I did not find this book helpful, I am very sorry to say.  
 I confess, I like Starbucks. I like to have my cappuccino made for me. I also like to make my own on occaision.  This machine worked well for a while and then it seemed to be clogged after a couple of months of not being used. There were two available options for service. One company in my whole state who was 2 hours away and the manufacturers rep in NY. I chose NY. I didn't get it out until after the year was up, although I had gotten a number at 10-11 months.  They charged me $70 to fix the machine, claiming that --I-- did something to one of the hoses.  Gaggia Esspresso is a great machine, but don't expect service if something goes wrong. I laid out over $200 for the machine which I rarely used. Then another $70-$80 bucks to get it fixed when it should have been covered by warranty.  Next time I'll buy another brand. I won't reccommend any other one, because I don't want you to think I work for a different brand. I don't 
 This book began to contradict on matter of King of kings Ismail. In one Chapter author wrote that King Ismail was a great King and was the best thing happened to Iran, the following chapter the author illustarted King Ismail as a burtail King of Iran 
 Our baby boy loves jumping and swinging but this product is not well designed (and I'm an industrial designer Dad, so I should know!). It can hit the door frame easily, the seat is way too deep even though our baby is above average height. He's banged his mouth a few times into the hard plastic portion when he swings in or jumps in it. He has fun in it at first, but it always seem a disappointment in the end. Save your time and money and get the Baby Einstein Excersaucer. THAT is agreat toy and better for development skills 
 The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money 
 I wanted to, I really did! But I just can't bring myself to do it. I read "One True Thing" and "Black and Blue" and loved them both. My copy of "Object Lessons" mentions B&B on it, which should have been a dead givaway that this was a weak fledgling effort first novel by the author, which it was. Oh, it had it's moments, but they were few and far between. Overall the feeling was just sadness bordering on depression, the kind of novels that were in abundance in the 70's. Perhaps that's when she wrote it. I would not recommend it to anyone 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 I had been excited to read of Daniel Boulud's Braise. He is a great chef, and having become comfortable with the braising technique from Molly Steven's book, I was looking forward to Daniel's ideas. I tried seven dishes. Of the four beef dishes my family ate, only the Beef Shoulder with Jerusalem Artichokes and Carrots was tasty enough to be served again. It was complex and the Jerusalem Artichokes were exotic but did taste like they belonged in a beef stew. We also ate the Paleron de Boeuf au Vin Rouge, which was merely an adequate variation on a daube,and Smoky Beef Chili, which uses lime juice instead of tomato for its acid,but cooking dimished the tang, so the final flavor seemed tamed and dull. We tried the Braised Ground Beef with Split Peas, Apricots and Apples and the Red Cabbage with Apples and Honey,and they were both way sweet. My daughter loved the cabbage candy. I also cooked the Veal Breast Braised with Cinnamon and Green Olives, which was edible(unlike the two previous) but, well, maybe the nuance of the 20/lb serrano ham is lost after being braised for 2 hours. Again, the cinnamon seemed to give an excessive sweetness to the dish. I tried the dessert braise of Mangoes and Carrots With Honey and Ginger-Lime Whipped Cream. The cream was outstanding, but the braise was a what was I thinking moment. Over all, I've been disappointed. Maybe I'll have tastier times with fowl and pork. 
 CD album not what I thought it was....Of course PB plays a mouth harp.....of course, the songs sometimes all sound alike...that is why he's not a ZZ, BB or whatever. One maybe two songs on these 2 cd's I like.....the rest go in file 13. There's nothing wrong with this style of music but it falls far short of Buddy Guy, BB King, Albert King....I am/was relunctant to negative any musician and this is not the case....Many of his good songs are missing and "fillers" placed instead. Unless you are a whipping Paul Butterfield fan, keep looking..... 
 This is the worst of the Starfist novels by far. It lacks plot direction, it is disjointed in time as well as being the first of a 2 parter. IMHO this book is a waste of time and money 
 These were the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever put on my feet.  (I say "were" because I threw them in the trash after 4 hours of wear).  They are cute, though 
 I did not choose to read this book... my great-grandmother gave it to me for christmas years ago and I knew I should read it sooner or later. So I read it.  And didn't like it. It was boring, and to me there was no point and each different part starts off like the part before last never happened. These stories don't seem to connect to each other, and I was confused and I wish that the whole story could've been about "The Red Pony" like the title. Because I actually liked the first part, but the rest was a waste of my time. The only good thing I could say about it was that I finally got that one out of the way so now I can read more appealing books 
 If I like the way an author writes, I give that author's genres, other than mystery, a chance. These stories have become boring.  I am going back to her FBI and crime fiction.  Her plots are still fine there 
 Almost six years ago I decided to buy this album for a friend but when I got this album she had gone on vacation and due to some events I ended up moving taking this album and losing the receipt. So I decided to listen to it and at first I thought it was allright but then it grew on my nerves, laughable growls that made you think that she just tries and fails to sound tough.Long story short, bad sound bad singing and songwriting and just a waste of time and money. Get otep or arch enemy for better female fronted metal bands 
 This book is another product designed to get you to buy Gary Null's ever expanding product base. Here we have the same information just recycled under a new title with Null's non-traditional PhD added. Gary knows everything and anything about everything so eat his organic vegetarian diet with juicing to detox and lose weight. Gary advises a limiting, costly, bland, and impossible to follow regimen for the normal working person who is out of the house much of the day. So the person tries it out and is guaranteed to fail. But that is the point of Gary Null Inc.- advocate a regimen few will be able to follow so that they will buy his costly supplements and meal replacements. Then get them to tune in to his radio program so he can scare his audience with gloom and doom so that they can buy his magnets, water filters, air cleaners etc. Finally promise your audience the fountain of youth and the ability to live forever with no illness and you have got lifetime customers and a multi-million dollar a year revenue stream 
 Judson is an academic manque who wrote an interesting if overly pretentious and self-agrandizing history of molecular biology. Unfortunately this book, which, as Judson states early on, could not find a publisher, would have been better left unpublished. This desultory history of scientific fraud simply rehearses what has been better said elswhere. The standard fraud cases - from Newton to Pasteur to Freud to Darsee to Baltimore - are given a superficial treatment. Especially egregious is the hatchet job on Baltimore and Imanashi-Kari. Anyone wanting to find out how shoddy and partisan his treatment of the later affair is ought to read the thoughtful and well researched "The Baltimore Case" by Daniel Kevles.  Since Judson seems to regard himself as a purveyor of scientific ethics in a time of lapsing moral values in the scientific enterprise, one can only hope that the scientific community can protect themselves from such scrutiny. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes.  
 I found it amazing that Fay Vincent tries to pass this off as a new idea.  Donald Honig already did this, and did it better.  Apparently, what the players said was transcribed verbatim, which made it difficult to read.  Additionally, most serious baseball fans have heard this all before.  Bobby Doerr and Johnny Pesky's stories were covered in detail in David Halberstam's The Teamates.  This is supposed to be the first of a series of books like this.  If so, this was the last one I purchased 
 I read the synopsis of this book and thought that it sounded like an engaging read so I bought it expecting a magnificently  poignant novel. However, I was massively disappointed. Simply put, I found the entire book unremarkable. None of the characters seemed real to me nor did I feel any empathy for them. Their situations and dilemmas felt vague and unimportant at best. I believe that this is largely due to the author's continual  time jumping. By the time I became used to one character and her tale the story shifted to that of the character's mother or grandmother. I did not see the connection between the modern day characters life and that of her grandmother.  Why, if the book is mostly focused on the grandmother's life were we told in mind numbing detail about the life of her granddaughter?  How was this supposed to fit into the story? However, I continued to read mostly due to the tantalizing hints of something more exciting and  tragic to come. But this was not to be. The book ended much as it started, pointlessly. The "big" mystery of the novel  that supposedly shrouded the grandmother's marriage was an utter disappointment. The mystery was simply too banal and lifeless to be of any interest. I felt let down by the author after I had invested so much time in the novel to find out that the tragedy was as simple and uninteresting as what it turned out to be.  I did not hate this novel as you might suspect, but I did not like it either. It was one of those novels that is mildly interesting but if you put it down you will probably never pick it up again. If you feel that the novel is still worth reading then I recommend checking it out from the library. If I had done this I would never have checked it out again nor would I have bought it. Overall, this is a waste of time and money. There are too many good books in the world to waste time on this one.  I Recommend : Light on Snow, The Lovely Bones, A Peacock Spring, Not Without My Daughter, I Dreamed of Africa, Flowers in the Attic, Nell's Quilt, the Left Behind Series and the quintessential horror novels the Ravenloft Series. 
 The first time we set the arbor up we found the top would not fit over the frame.  Two parts pulled off the top trying to get it to fit.  The seller forwarded the photos and complaint to Texsport and they sent us another top.  When we put that top on we found the same thing.  That is when we found the frame was 4" longer than the top.  There were seams that were not sewn properly and there was a hook missing on one corner.  After cutting the poles down we were able to get the thing put together.  When next spring comes we will replace this one and I can assure you it will not be a Texsport product 
 I have over 20 commentaries on First John.  I consider this among the bottom five.  Analysis is superficial and not particularly insightful.  It might be an acceptable book for an introduction to First John, but if that's what you want, there are better books.  If you are looking for solid introductory books, try Marshall or Smalley.  If you are looking for deep textual analysis try Brown or Brooke.  I don't agree with the positions taken by all of these authors, but their works are far more insightful then the Pillar book.  I recently went back to college to audit a course where the Kruse book was a required text.  Part way through the course, the professor apologized for using the book and said that in the future he will use a different book for First John 
 Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead 
 Considering how hefty this volume is, I was hoping to find recipes to produce well-cooked, flavorful meats with nearly any cut of meat I had in my freezer, using everyday ingredients I would normally have on hand. Not necessarily so. This is more of a gourmet's cookbook for those with time to cook, access to big-city delis and a liking for fussy sauces. Example: Puebla-Style Tongue in Chipotle Chile Sauce; Cured Pork Loin Roasted with Parsnips in Maple-Vanilla Sauce; Caribbean Pork Braised with Limes and Oranges; Sauteed Filet Mignon with Corn and Chile Cheese Sauce. There is some basic information on how to best cook some cuts of meat, but not enough to justify the price of the book, and the recipes rely heavily on the fancy ingredients. As a side note, if you don't like to include alcohol in your cooking, this is not the book for you! The recipes and tips on cooking pork ribs were good 
 Have not yet seen the movie! This was one of the films I ordered for my very first HD order. Also included in the order were King Kong, Mission Impossible 1~3, The Good Shephard & Children of Men. Of these, only KK and MI 1~3 played on my new Xbox360 HD DVD player. The other three discs could not play! I started looking into this on the net and found that this was some sort of interface problems with the Xbox 360, although I only found this problem relating to The Good Shephard and Children of Men specifically and no instances of this problem occuring with A Scanner Darkly during my search on the net, it could be that I was just unlucky and got a defective copy of this HD DVD. I have read that there will be update release from MS to correct this problem through Xbox Live, but I'm not sure this will fix the problem.  If you've got the Xbox 360 HD DVD player, be warned this may not work on your player.  Anyone else having this problem, I would certainly like to know 
 This is a great book if you have the right teacher. The book is very informative yet if you have no back ground in abnormal psych you might want to make sure the teacher for your course is capable of explaining it to you. I also recomend that you make sure your copy has a CD rom. The study guide and website are great tools too. They help a lot 
 I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good 
 The VHS took quite a while to arrive. I had ordered 5 other items at the same time and it arrived almost 3 weeks later than all the others, I actually had given up on it's showing up.  The video itself rolls quite a bit at the end of the video when played. However, with the age of the movie, I will grant them some slack.  I was disappointed in service and the product.  I will not buy another movie from this seller 
 I read this short novel because I greatly admired Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning "Killer Angels," and because I'm a baseball fan.  The novel feels more like an outline or first draft than a completed work about an aging pitcher.  It's a bit shallow and predictable in its plot.  The characters are what one expects in all too many sports novels and short stories.  The feel or atmosphere just isn't quite there.  Any baseball fan will see flaws in the book right away, flaws that distract and damage the work.  Shaara sets most of the novel in Yankee Stadium with the Hawks playing the Yankees.  Why the author chose to have one real team against a fictional team is unclear.  The Hawks apparently are from Atlanta, but an Atlanta team, Braves or Hawks, whichever, would not be playing the Yankees interleague on the next to last day of the season.  Finally, when a visiting pitcher goes out to warm up before the game, he does so in the semi-hidden bull pen down the left field line in Yankee Stadium--not on the mound on the field.  This book was published posthumously and Mr. Shaara perhaps never had a chance to polish his prose--prose that was excellent in "Killer Angels."  It's unfortunate.  There are glimmers of interest in the book, but not enough to recommend it to baseball fans or fans of the author's other book 
 As with the reviewer above, I purchased this fan from another store and it worked well at first.  The remote was a nice touch and the fan speeds and settings worked well.  However within 4 months of owning it, when we tried to have it rotate, it turns slightly, gets stuck, and proceeds to just make a clicking sound until you stop it from rotating.  Needless to say it no longer rotates, so it is now just a stationary fan.  I even tried taking it apart to unjam it, but came to discover that the rotating gear was already worn down and that was the problem, so without new parts it could not be fixed.  Buy another fan if you want it to last, I know I am.  
 I often wonder if some if not most of the people writing rave reviews, 5 stars, are really paid, biased, professionals pumping up the movie for increased DVD sales.  
 I would rather have thrown 17 dollars worth of quarters into one of fountains at the mall then have spent it on this book. It just took waaaaaaaaay too long to get to the parts about Clay. I can't believe that by page 125 Clay STILL hasn't been invented. 125 pages of nothing but reading about an annoying main character (Davie) that does nothing but smoke cigarettes with his best friend, kind of like a girl named Maria, remember the one time a boy named Mouldy beat him up and think another main character, Stephan Rose, is weird. Seemed like a lot of filler or maybe David Almond, the author, decided he just had to write about his own dull childhood.   Anyway, I don't make a habit out of being mean about a writer's work, but there just were no redeeming factors about this novel except, I dunno, it has a neat cover. I wish I could have the time I wasted reading this book back. I paid full price for it from Borders and fully intend to return it so I can trade it in for a better book. What a waste. I only wish I could give it zero or negative 1 stars. 
 If there's a worse movie than this I haven't seen it! Looks like it was made in a day. The quality is dark and muddy with choppy edits. Sort of like it was copied from a VHS tape that was recorded in the 6 hour mode after it was played 6,000 times. The actors and actresses deliver their lines like they are playing aliens in a bad Twilight Zone episode. If you look hard enough you can see the guy holding the cue cards in the scenes. The musical performances are obscure little known Doo Wop Flops! (except for Frankie Lymon). Look.....I wasted $14.99 plus tax plus gas to "run out" and buy this bomb. The only possible way to save it would be to maybe dub it in Swedish, send it to a Greenwich Village "art house" and pass it off as a foreign film. Come to think of it....don't bother to dub it.....the sound is so off it looks dubbed already! IMPORTANT UPDATE.....PLEASE READ THIS! I later discovered after I wrote this review that there is some significant social redeeming value to this little gem of the 50's. I understand that it is used constantly at the International Institute For Sleep Disorders as the most preferred method of inducing a semi-comcious near sleep state for incurable Insomniacs. And so as I write this update I've been watching the flick again and I must admit.....I.....(yawn) oh excuse me...where was I...oh yes I must admit that I.....(bigger yawn) Oh my goodness....I'm so sorry....This is so rude of me....(yawn) but it seems like.....(snoring)....I....(snoring) I just can't seem to (intense snoring)........ 
 I wish I had read further in the reviews, if I had known that the song 'I Love The Nite Life' had been replaced I would never have bought the film. It is very limp without this...shame, shame, shame! This should be mentioned so that folks can make a more informed decision, instead of wasting money 
 I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there. 
 Peter was a fair book. I enjoyed reading Peter, however the ending was not satisfying. As I have learned over the years from reading many books, you cannot decide how the book ends. This may seem strange, however, I was disappointed by the ending. Peter was not particularly my taste: a funny, suspenseful book with a firm closing ending. Rather, it is a real-life book teaching a lesson. Whether or not you pick this book is up to you, but if you are looking for a good book to read and found this book by picking at random, or it looked interesting, I recommend that you continue your search. I rate Peter with 2 to 3 stars 
 Over 90% of pictures I took by this Canon are blurry. No way can you fix it. I really got fed up with it. Waist your money. Waist your time. More important, waist your precious moments! 
 If we follow Ledeen off the Machiavellian cliff, what is left of the dream of the Founding Fathers for us to defend? This book illustrates one thing that is very important: in times of stress, normally intelligent people lose their sense of reason and let partisanship, xenophobia, or even megalomania rule their thoughts. Ledeen tells us to pursue the very course our forefathers rejected when they founded the USA, and he says it without the slightest trace of irony. Unfortunately for Ledeen, he negates his own title, for if we follow his prescription, those who "hate our freedoms" have already won by causing errant and misguided patriots to subvert the framework which supported those freedoms. Unfortunately for all of us, Ledeen has been taken seriously and literally by the Bush administration. Laws, Constitution, and even Geneva conventions are ignored because the end supposedly justifies the means. History says otherwise. Ledeen apparently believes that his book represents the moment in which historical patterns no longer apply to our world. Historians, if there are any left, will tell us whether he was right.  Shooshi 
 I found this book to be worthless. Buy Blues you can use or Blues by the bar which are both great books for learning how to play the blues. Skip this one as it is a complete waste of time an money. 
 Author displays his ignorance of the Holy Scriptures through out his book. Let me just highlight three areas.  (1) He quotes 1 Timothy 2:9-15 and then makes the following blasphemous statement,  " Furthermore, they (woman) are held responsible for the origin of sin in the world: It was the woman who was deceived, not the man. " How spiritually blind one can get?   Let me elaborate. Apostle Paul in his letter to the church at Rome writes:  Romans 5:12 "Just as sin entered into the world by one man, and death by means of sin, so death was imposed upon all men, in asmuch as they all have sinned."  Holy Spirit is holding Adam responsible for the entry of sin into the world. Yes Eve was deceived first by that serpent of old, called the Devil. Adam was not deceived, but disobeyed deliberately. Adam was the door through whom sin entered the world. Sin was the door through which death entered the world. I strongly feel that the words spoken by my Savior, Lord Eshoo Messiah (Aramaic for Jesus Christ) to Nichodemus in John 3:10 are applicable to Marcus Borg also.  John 3:10  Eshoo answered, You are a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not undertsnad these things.?  (2) Author writes:  " I see the Bible as human response to God. Rather than seeing God as Scriptures's ultimate author.... the Bible thus tells us about how they saw things, not about how God sees things." This is blasphemy.   Holy Scriptures consisting of (Law of Moshey, Prophets, Psalms, four Gospels, Book of the Acts of the Apostles, 14 Epistles of Apostle Paul, one Epistle of James, two Epistles of Peters, three Epistles of John, one Epistle of Jude, and the Lord Eshoo Messiah's revelation to John) are Living WORD of God spoken by His prophets and Apostles through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. If God had not revealed Himself, we will still be speculating because we are fallen and fallible creatures. I thank the Lord that He took initiative and revealed Himself.  Apostle Peter writes:   "We have also a TRUE WORD of prophesy; you do well when you look to it for guidance, as you look to the lamp that shines in a dark place until the dawn of day, when the sun will shine in your hearts."  God with wisdom created the heaven and earth in the very beginning. Book of Proverbs was written so that we may know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; to receive discipline, reverence, righteousness, and justice, and equity.It says the following about God's word:  Proverbs 8:8-9  "All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing perverse or deceptive in them. They are all plain to him who understands them, and right to those who are willing to find knowledge."  Author ignored the words of the Holy Spirit spoken through King Solomon, Son of David, wherein he writes:   "If you will turn to my reproof, behold, I will pour out My Spirit upon you; I will make known My words to you(Proverbs 1:23.)"   In my view, author of the book while thinking within himself that he is wise, he became fool (Romans 1:22.).   (3)Let me illustrate author's foolishness with another blasphemy. He writes:   " But a moment's reflection suggests that the Ten Commandments are also a human product and written from a male point of view.". I wonder if he has ever studied the book of Pslams. Let me just quote Psalm 19 where law is called Law of the LORD.  Psalm 19:7-11  "The Law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making wise the young men. The statues of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. The reverence of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; the judgment of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. They are more to be coveted than gold; yea, than precious stones; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb. Moreover by them Thy servant is warned; and if he keep them he shall be greatly rewarded."  Book of Revelation says that:  "This is the perseverence of saints that they keep the commandment of God and their testimony of Eshoo Messiah, who is King of kings, LORD of lords."  Apostle Peter 2000 years ago had warned us of such self appointed professors when he writes:  2 Peter 3:16 "..... In Paul's epistles there are certain things so hard to be understood that those who are ignorant and unstable pervert their meanings, as they do also the other Scriptures, to their own destruction".  Holy Spirit calls such authors as "springs without water, cloud that are carried away with a tempest; the mist of darkness is reserved for them forever.....". "Verily it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment that was delivered to them."  Author's contempt for the Holy Scriptures can be traced to his upbringing in the Lutheran church. He says: "I was nurtured in the the Lutheran church and remained Lutheran until about age 30."  Luther is not much of a roll model for anything. It is Luther who showed contempt for the Holy Scriptures when he called book of James, " an epistle of straw". Luther called book of Revelation, "worthless". Talk about having an arrogant and audacious attitude. Lord Eshoo Messiah said "unless we become like little children we can not enter the kingdom of God". By that, my Savior did not mean at all that we should be childish. What he talks about is having child like trust.   Book of Psalms tells that "He teaches humble His way".   And "fear of God is the beginning of wisdom but fool despise wisdom and instruction."   To such self appointed reformers and professors, Holy Spirit had issued following warning in the Epistle of James:  James 3:1 "Let not many of you become teachers,my brethren, knowing that as such we will incur a stricter judgment."  Luther should have kept himself busy studying God's word instead of writing the anti-jewish tripe, " Jews and their lies". This book came in very handy for Hitler who sent 6 millions of the seed of Abraham( Jews) to their death in holocaust - pan European event. 6th commandment, which is Law of God says: "Thou shall not kill or murder"   Holy Scriptures says that like cloud and wind without rain is man who boast of his gift falsely. Neither Luther nor the author possess the gift of teaching. I am convinced that there was no reformation. Things have not changed at all. In Rome we have one Pope on seven hills. Protestant movement has produced seven popes on every dunghill(western and eastern churches).  Lord Eshoo during His earthly ministry did not speak of reformations or revivals, but instead said:  " Because of the growh of iniquity (lawlessness) love of many will grow cold. Will Son of Man find faith when He returns?"  I want to cry out: Help Lord, godly men ceases to be, and faith has disappeared from the earth"  Let me end my review with the following words of encouragement as well as warning given by the Holy Spirit:  Proverbs 30: 5-6  "Every word of God is pure; He is a shiled to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words; lest He reprove you, and you be found a liar."  He who has ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.  Sincerely and Cordially Dr. Ram Munjal Ph.D.(Physics); S.S   
 After reading the book "Ask and it is given" and realy enjoying these wonderful teachings I was very excited to learn that a new book is available. I could not wait to order it and the day I received it I started to read right away, in excitement  to find more teachings. Much to may dissapointment I found out the the book "The amazing Power of deliberate intent" is almost a total copy of the first book, with the same storys and even the same excercises 
 Only 8 tracks and some of them real soppy..don't waste your time or money 
 Neiwert tries to be two things at once -- a storyteller as well as an advocate for hate crimes laws -- and the result is a muddled effort. He interweaves the chapters with social science discussions of hate crimes and ongoing news of the trial. In addition, he repeats himself (especially the trial portion), and the book feels padded. The story itself is no more than a long magazine article, and the characterizations of the main two actors are thin. As a courtroom drama, the story lacks suspense. 
 The Editorial review states that Dr. Key Scarpetta is back to solve the mystery of the death of a reporter. After suffering through the book, though there are two murders of note in the book, I did not see any 'solving' of the murders by Dr. Key Scarpetta. She just had to be "present' and the 'solving' took care of itself.   This is the first book that I have read of Patricia Cornwell and will definitely be the last. This is definitely a formulaic book written for hard core fans.    
 IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN THAT I BUY A DUD, BUT THIS WAS ONE!! I LOVE MUSIC(EVERYTHING FROM RUSH TO MOZART)THIS WAS AN INCOHERENT MESS!! IF I WERE IVOR CUTLER OR NICK MASON, I WOULD'NT WANT MY NAME ON IT! 1 STAR IS TO MANY!! GOOD LUCK TO ANY ONE WHO TRYS THIS ONE! 
 I love the actually pendent the time it got there was great. But I really didn't like how they show the pendent on a chain because I bought it for the whole package (chain included). So when I got it I was SHOCKED that it didn't included it. So buyers beware this supplier doesn't give you the actually chain which can cost you up to and extra $15-$30 even thou they adversities it in their ad. 
 "How to save money and time, don't but this book."  This book is useless to the average person.  It only deals with the 1 or 2% of people that need to hide their assets.  And his methods are so impractical, renting out a broom closet in a building for a mail slot? He even says that you might need to lie on a postal application, which is against the law, do get what you need.  And there are too many stories from newspapers that are the most extreme circumstances.  He had one good chapter about identity theft and shredding your documents, but the rest is realy far fetched.  Do not buy this book even if you needed kindling...it's that bad 
 'Moving Target, The' is the first novel in which noir-American writer Ross McDonald introduces his most famous detective, Lew Archer. Published in 1948, in a time when noir movies was at the top, the book is just a unremarkable pulp fiction story with classic ingredients as murder, treason, much money, kidnapped and poor ladies in distress. When you read 'Moving Target, The' you feel that McDonald was very far to develop a strong and convincing work; in fact, most of the time the reader will feel the influence of some other authors hovering above Mc Donald's style. Great authors, to be sure, as Raymond Chandler, for instance. The story is just normal, and sometimes even full of flaws. But Archer is a good characther. In a way, his sympathy and easy way saves this book to be a complete misfire.  
 I know how important the notion that God does everything for His own glory is to Piper and his ilk, but I don't buy that idea about God's character, which makes this book just about impossible to get behind, since Piper keeps coming back to that point over and over. The book has some inspiring moments that should motivate people toward at least giving the missionary world a hard look, but the heavily Calvinist theology that undergirds it was a turn-off for me. Piper's a fine writer, however 
 The photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition's cover. However you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of The Doorbell Rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances. The mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen.   With just twenty pages my seven-year old breezed through the book in six minutes. The favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story. The Doorbell Rang begins with a Mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son Sam and daughter Victoria. " I've made some cookies for tea, said Ma". The children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to Grandma's.  By flipping through the pages of the Doorbell Rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger, but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there, but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats. The cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention. More kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie. It is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth. The serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer. Meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail.   The final arrival for this story is Grandma, with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. All the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table. Not very sanitary as far as I am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table. The dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home.    The portrayal of the Mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me. The kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them.   At least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the Mother finally sat down. For a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read I highly doubt there would be interest. There is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child's Grandma's cookies. There are roughly two to four sentences on each page. The good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this 
 With due respect for anybody who has the fortitude to actually write a book, and even more so an active police officer, this is the biggest load I have read in a long, long time.  The author, figuring if a little gore is good, a lot of gore is better, and a boatload of gore has got to be great. All the timne trying to convince us that by dropping a few real names and a lot of local L.A. folklore, that this book is somehow steeped in reality.  In a 20 page span, we have poor souls killed by shoulder mounted rockets, pit bulls, snapping turtles, a jaguar, a sword cane, and of course the usual assortment of mac-11's, nine milimeters, colt pythons, shotguns, and assorted automatic weapons.   This story goes from the implausable, to the impossible, to the ridiculous faster that a Code 3 Crown Vic.  That being said, I hope the author makes a boatload of bucks, his book gets made into a movie, and he lives the Hollywood dream, because when all is said and done, I like it when a non-pro hits one out of the park 
 I bought the book in the airport and started reading it during the 8 hours flight. I could not believe that such an uninteresting and painfully slow paced novel was a bestseller...I forced myself through the first 30 pages...but that was it. I just left it in the airplane.Maybe later got more interesting,I woudn't know that. But what I read was just plain awafull. Now that I look at the amazon's reviews...they are not so bad......makes me very cautious about reviews in the futur 
 This is a terrible book with a terrible message: that you should use the understanding of other cultures in order to infiltrate and change them. That is NOT the message of anthropology.  As an anthropologist, I resent this book profoundly.  Anthropology is based on tolerance for other cultures, interest in their own ways of being and believing, and the concept of cultural relativism--that a culture's values and morals can only be understood in their own terms.  The one thing we do NOT do is try to impose our own "truths" on others.  If missionaries want to learn what anthropology really is, then read an anthropology book.  But this text merely steals from anthropology in the most primitive way and turns that stolen material into the guidelines for cultural judgment, invasion, and destruction. It is arrogant and misguided 
 This book is about accepting change but not how to embrace it. It is a very easy book to read because it is a story format. This book did not help me deal with change in my life. 
 Was not up to my expectations.   Nice story  - and most likely true, but did not care how it was presented 
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 The "Register" provides nothing that isn't easily available on NFL dot COM. This is nothing more than a listing of all players and their basic stats.  Perhaps worth about $4, certainly not $19.  It's a shame that STATS, Inc doesn't publish the "Pro Football Handbook" or "The 100-Yard War: Pro Football Revealed" books any more.  Those books were fantastic.  Compared to them the "Register" is nothing more than a waste of paper 
 While I read the reviews on this machine, it is clear to me that Lexar has some serious quality-control problems. For some people it worked, for others it was a miserable failure. I am in the latter group. Sigh.  Mine was dead on arrival. I tried the device with *BOTH* of my Windows-XP machines and in both cases, it was unrecognized. Lexar tech support subsequently proved to be a contradiction in terms as they would not return my email requests for help 
 This book sucks so bad.  All of the redundant crap that everyone makes  kids read about the Holocaust is so depressing.  We all understand that  WWII was a terrible thing and that the Axis forces did hideous things to  Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, Poles, etc.  Do we have to keep reading about  it?  I feel like my brain has been drained!  It's all so depressing, so  negative.  Move on, people.  I might sound insensitive...sure, this was an  atrocious thing and deeply affected those involved, but move on.  My priest  says that we bear our own crosses.  The Holocaust is NOT going on now.  We  need to learn from what happened (I have!) and MOVE ON 
 I never thought that a thriller could be boring, but this one is. The characters are unsympathetic (especially the heroine; I would have expected to feel sorry for a survivor of sex abuse, but this woman gives me the chills); the plotline feels contrived.... I had to force myself to finish it 
 The color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture. Also, from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows. Good customer support though I couldn't return it because of being a gift 
 This guy needs to stop flattering himself.  He isn't controversial or innovative.  He is merely stupid.  The idea that some education or pysch major is going to have something important to say about biology is laughable.  It is clear he didn't take (because he couldn't pass) Biology 101.  Kind of goes against he's theories doesn't it.  I (a physician) found his references to hormones and neuroanatomy comical.  A failing pre-med knows more than he does!  He states something about the hormones maturing faster in girls.  Well, last time I checked, the structure of various hormones was constant.  The hormones themselves don't change a bit.  No one who had the slightest inkling of what they were talking about would refer to this is such terms.    This guy is just projecting his social agenda on a bunch of biological terms he doesn't understand.  The only people who would fall for this are those who a)know less than he does and b) have the same agenda.    
 Really horrible stuff. Here's some history the book forgot to mention....  The U.S. Congress immediately passed legislation providing enforcement provisions for FDR's Executive Order, unanimously in both the House and Senate, provided under Article 1, Section 9 of the United States Constitution.     Only persons of Japanese ancestry (alien and citizen) residing in the West Coast military zones were affected by the evacuation order. Those living elsewhere were not affected at all.     It is not true that Japanese-Americans were "interned. Only Japanese nationals (enemy aliens) arrested and given individual hearings were interned. Such persons were held for deportation in Department of Justice camps. Those evacuated were not interned. They were first given an opportunity to voluntarily move to areas outside the military zones. Those unable or unwilling to do so were sent to Relocation Centers operated by the War Relocation Authority.  At the time, the JACL (Japanese American Citizens League) officially supported the government's evacuation order and urged all enemy alien Japanese and Japanese Americans to cooperate and assist the government in their own self interest.     It is misleading and in error to state that those affected by the evacuation orders were all "Japanese-Americans." Approximately two-thirds of the ADULTS among those evacuated were Japanese nationals--enemy aliens. The vast majority of evacuated Japanese-Americans (U.S. citizens) were children at the time. Their average age was only 15 years. In addition, over 90% of Japanese-Americans over age 17 were also citizens of Japan (dual citizens)under Japanese law. Thousands had been educated in Japan. Some having returned to the U.S. holding reserve rank in the Japanese armed forces.  During the war, more than 33,000 evacuees voluntarily left the relocation centers to accept outside employment. An additional 4300 left to attend colleges.     In a questionaire, over 26% of Japanese-Americans of military age at the time said they would refuse to swear an unqualified oath of allegiance to the United States.     According to War Relocation Authority records, 13,000 applications renouncing their U.S. citizenship and requesting expatriation to Japan were filed by or on behalf of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Over 5,000 had been processed by the end of the war.     After loyalty screening, eighteen thousand Japanese nationals and Japanese-Americans were segregated at a special center for disloyals at Tule Lake California where regular military "Banzai" drills in support of Emperor Hirohito were held.     The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Consitutionality of the evacuation/relocation in Korematsu v. U.S., 1944 term. In summing up for the 6-3 majority, Justice Black wrote: "There was evidence of disloyalty on the part of some, the military authorities considered that the need for action was great, and time was short. We cannot -- by availing ourselves of the calm perspective of hindsight -- now say that at the time these actions were unjustified." That decision has never been reversed and stands to this day.     It should be noted that the relocation centers had many amenities. Accredited schools, their own newspapers, stores, churches, hospitals, all sorts of sports and recreational facilities. They also had the highest percapita wartime birth rates for any U.S.community.  More history for you to consider regarding the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians:  Consider that of the nine commission members, six were biased in favor of reparations. Ishmail Gromoff and William Marutani, relocatees themselves, sat in judgment of their own cases. Arthur Goldberg and Joan Bernstein made sympathetic, pro-reparation statements publicly before hearings even began. Arthur Fleming had worked closely with the JACL (he was a keynote speaker at its Portland convention in the '70s). Robert Drinan was a co-sponsor of the bill establishing the commission.  Consider that notices of when and where hearings were to be held were not made known to the general, non-Japanese public.  Consider that witnesses who gave testimony were not sworn to tell the truth.   Consider that witnesses who were pro-reparation were carefully coached in their testimony in "mock hearings" beforehand.  Consider that witnesses against reparation were harassed and drowned out by foot-stomping Japanese claques, that the commission members themselves ridiculed and badgered these same witnesses.  Consider that not one historian was asked to testify before the commission, that intelligence reports and position papers contrary to reparations were deliberately ignored.   Consider that as a result of the above, the United States Department of Justice objected strongly to the findings of the commission.  Lastly while we've all been educated on the doctrines associated with the rise of Nazism, I would be curious to know if courses are provided teaching the history of the doctrines of Japanese militarism, a belief system similar and equally as insidious as Nazism?  Any clasess on the kokutai? Hakko Ichiu? Any reading of Kokutai no Hongi? Shimin to Michi? The role of Nichiren Buddhism and Japanese "Language Schools" in teaching these doctines of Japanese racial superiorty to ethnic Japanese colonies throughout the word prior to Pearl Harbor?  Those of you learning this history at your public schools and universities should understand you are being taught an extemely biased and partial version of what really happened and why. I would urge you to go beyond the politically correct version of this history as propagated by the Japanese-American reparations movement.  Your taxdollars going to these folks to brainwash your kids.... Be very concerned...  http://www.library.ca.gov/cclpep/index.cfm#admi 
 The passage of time has been devastating for this book, and the analysis of its author.  While it could be argued that the removal of Saddam was certainly a plus for the people of Iraq, it was inconsequential on any geopolitical level.  As was clear to anyone who properly studied the issue before the war, Iraq circa 2003 was no longer a threat to its neighbors, and now after the war this fact becomes doubly obvious.  Those who had experience in Iraq, and specific knowlege of Iraq's weapons capabilities (Scott Ritter, the  IAEA, Hans Blix, David Albright) were pretty uniform in their assessment that Iraq of 2003 was simply not the threat Pollack claimed.  Now that we can easily see firsthand the shattered infrastructure of Iraq, its depleted military, its decimated defenses and economy, it is clear that containment had worked--only too well, in many cases.  The absurdity of Bush's--and Pollack's--claims have been laid bare.  The fact that Mr. Pollack essentially assisted Bush in making a case for an unwarranted, baseless pre-emptive attack and occupation on a defenseless, non-threatening nation is inexcusable.  This level of appeasment is tantamount to a modern-day Chamberlain.  Pollack is not, and should not, be forgiven.  All those who supported this war, freely sacrificing our troops to this unworthy cause, bear a horrible scarlet letter.  The blood of our troops is absolutely on Pollack's hands, as it is on any who supported this war.  Any evaluation on the pros and cons of the war must conclude that this has been a net loss for America, and the world.  While undoubtedly an improvement for Iraqi citizens, it has made the world at large more dangerous, and America in particular more open to pre-emptive attack.  The rationale of pre-emption is now a reality, waiting to strike America, or other nations, at an opportune moment.  The overall geopolitical consequences of the Iraq War are devastating for America, and we now face a much larger conflict with the Muslim world than we ever did before.  Sixty-year alliances are now shattered, and America is distrusted--for what?  A free Iraqi soccor team?  I agree with a previous reviewer--this book should remain in print solely as a warning to future generations.  When otherwise responsible, progressive intellectuals get into bed with thuggish warmongers, the results are disastrous.  I now know what it was like in Germany during the 30's 
 Most O'reilly books are praised for describing computer programming concepts in a very readable way for an educated audience. Although, Erik Ray's book is engaging enough, he has left out so much detail in the language definitions and real examples that, after reading this book, it is not possible for even an experienced programmer to actually use the material. For example, the book explains the definition of schemas (without enough detail) but how do I use a schema in a project? The intended audience for this book appears to be people who already use xml that want a refresher at an elementary level. Very disappointing 
 Dividing classes reaises many questions regarding how the middle class views school advantage.  Through interviews and personal experiences, the author describes her positive and negative experiences with the educational system.  We found this book gives rise to many controversial issues some with which we agree as well as some issues we disagree with.  While the author does give concrete examples, we believe SES is not the only predictor for educational success 
 I have to strongly disagree with the editorial and reader reviews on this essay, even though it was a national bestseller. The book is touted as possibly the most rational description of a descent into morbid, clinical depression and suicidal despair. I didn't find it so. Styron was descriptive but rather than probing and baring the depths of his mind and emotions during his depression, I felt he only hinted at the tip of the iceberg. I didn't find any riveting, palpable tracing of his depression. It was rather moribund for a subject with such potential. There is a detachment throughout that many attribute to Styron's calculating dismantling of his own emotions to throw light into the abyss. I found the detachment sort of hovering over the pond, unwilling to dive in, which robs the reader. Candor, yes in some aspects. Precision, somewhat missing.  He quotes Dante "In the middle of the journey of our life, I found myself in a dark wood, for I had lost the right path." Styron was in the melancholia described by Dante but he never succeeds at identifying why or even how he managed to eventually recover.  From what most reviewers have said, this book should have been the definitive treatise on deep depression, written by a survivor. It is not that impressive at all 
 When people whine and moan about In Flames new stuff, this song instantly comes to mind.   Not only does it sound popish, with keyboards and whatnots, but it is absolutely unlike anything In Flames have done. People who like Taproot and other *hitty bands will like this garbage, while fans of melodeath should check out Lunar Strain, Jester Race, or even the new album Come Clarity 
 I found this book to repetitive.  It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates.  Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all.  It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC.  One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid.  She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you 
 THIS Book is the size of a playing card and there is so little information in it PASS IT BY! 60 Little pages with a few sentences on each flower. The full color pictures just do not make up for what I thought would be Good reading. Give it away as a door prize 
 The last line of my review comes first:  If you do not find church humor and church-esque situations (including a lot of parodying of church ideology and customs) funny, either due to inexposure (like me) or too much exposure (fundamentalism), this book is NOT for you.  And now the review:  I love Terry Pratchett - he is my favorite author of all time.  And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.  The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.  This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor.  The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel.  The characters are all church characters.  And the god is not so godly.  Over half of this book came across as a particularly long and pointless conversation between a dullard and his favorite stuffed animal.  Overall, I wish I'd had a review that had warned me thusly: (last line of the review 
 i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
 Like so many of you, I love Stephen King. I really do. He has given us so much that he is certainly forgiven for writing a stinker. But hey, we already had to read Gerald's Game! At least Gerald's story wasn't very long. However, Wolves of the Calla feels extraordinarily long because it is so damned boring. Also like so many of you, I do in fact plan to read all of King's books despite being let down by a few bad lemons. But, knowing this, knowing that so many readers will read on no matter what the hell King puts on the menu--shouldn't he take it upon himself to aim for a little less indulgence? If you cut all of the fat from Wolves you'd be left with one tasty little steak, perhaps a great short story that never got its chance to shine. Instead we have a book that simply doesn't do anything. You know from the get-go what's going to happen in the end and in King's own words (out of Roland's mouth)--that's only worth 5 minutes of actual fun and those five minutes--after a several hour investment--simply do not pay off. I was bored out of my f---ing mind listening to this overblown and obvious tale and I didn't even have Frank Muller as the reader to help me get through the journey. On that note, I truly hope Mr. Muller is on the mend. King ... well ... he's written his tale to its conclusion and so be it. But if Cell, a very mediocre book, is the indication of where King's going--is the best of him behind us now 
 This is the Worst camera I've ever owned. I'm not exaggerating. I'm so upset for wasting money on it. The only pictures that turn out, are outside in bright daylight. It takes horrible pictures in low light, there's a high level of noise in the photos. The video mode moves in and out on its own, ruining the video. I sometimes get colored lines down the right side of the videos. My friend's $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing. It just plain sucks. 
 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  Fists in the Pocket, released in Italy as "I Pugni in tasca", is the story of a dysfunctional Italian family and has been both praised and condemned.   The story is about a man who makes attempts to murder his blind mother and epileptic brother. The film has been praised for innovation and condemned for mockery of the family which is almost sacred in Italian culture.  I did not like the film for this reason.  The DVD contains interviews with director Marco Bellocchio, editor Silvano Agosti, actor Lou Castel, actor Paola Pitagora and film critic Tullio Kezich. The DVD also has a theatrical trailer and an afterward by Bernardo Bertolucci.  This film remains controversial and is not for everybody 
 Although this item is pretty, it is very light weight & feels cheaply mad 
 if you were on a deserted island with nothing and a copy of any of vaughan's works drifted on the beach, at least you'd be supplied with a little wipey paper and firestarting paper for a time. 
 Like many other reviewers, I am a fan of Sally Melville's.  I've been knitting for over 25 years, and purchased the Knit Stitch to help me to teach other people to knit.  Her illustrations and directions in that book were fabulous.  I recommended the book to new and old knitters alike, and every female friend of mine received a Sally scarf one holiday.  However, I took a knitting class with Sally at Stitches, and while I loved her, I did not like her sense of color. This book should not have been made.  It does not do her justice nor does it showcase her strengths.  The designs are very staid and the colors are ugly or boring. Buy her Knit or Purl books - this book is a dud 
 As other reviewers have mentioned, the photos are grainy. very grainy. However, left unmentioned was something even more troubling - many of the photos have been digitally cropped in photoshop or some such program. this was done presumably to save ink by not printing backgrounds. The cropping was done extremely poorly and amateurishly - there are toes that come to points, feet that look like blocks, all sorts of bizarre and unnatural concavities. a real hatchet job. the end result looks like someone took a pair of scissors and crudely snipped photos from a magazine. this sort of problem is particularly distressing in a book intended for artists as the accurate depiction of the outer contour of a form is vital for drawing.  On another note, the models are not actually that thin. more average. This would have been a useful book, if not for the botched photos. An older edition would likely be satisfactory. 
 This is probably the worst edited book I have ever read. Every second page a sentence with a missing verb or something equally important. Then there are the "missing or misplaced quotation marks. Finally, many sentences have a mysterious, comma dropped into them. All this brings reading to a halt as you stop to figure out what the author is trying to say.  Honestly, how much would it have cost to hire a grad student in English Lit to read it over?  In terms of the content, it was less than impressive. This book borrows ideas heavily from Paul Hawken's Growing a Business and Amar Bhide's articles in Inc magazine. But the book never acknowledges either writer. Instead the author tries to come across as if all this is new and original material.  Here is his advice in a nutshell:  Before investing any money into your startup, make a list of your proposed products features (before it exists), and then call 200 potential customers to ask if they'd buy such a product.  If it's affirmative, then have the product made and start selling it via telephone from your kitchen table.  Don't spend any money on anything until you have enough sales for positive cashflow.  That's it. 
 After finishing the 70-290 book in the set and taking the exam, I am shocked at how "out of touch" this book is with the actual exam.  Topics that were barely touched upon in the book ended up being huge sections in the test and vice versa.  I started buying Sybex cert books because of how well the CCNA book was done and how it actually related to the exam.  I'm hoping the other books in this kit are a little more up to par 
 Whether or not the book was particulary funny, I couldn't tell you.  I didn't get past the first chapter.  Every other sentence was a simile.  "I was raving mad like a castrated bull during mating season."  "I was confused like a Weight Watchers meeting being held in a Dunkin' Donuts."  "It was like..., I was like..., They were like..."  Not that mine are hilarious, but I'm not writing a book using similes as the foundation.  The writing was frustrating.  It's a good thing I only borrowed it from the library 
 I was very much looking forward to reading this. I'm approaching my 40th birthday, and wanted to hear how others had dealt with this transition. In all fairness, Ms. Braun does interview many women on their transitions. However, the language is superificial, sometimes to the point of being annoyingly "cutesy". For example her term "Fertile Void" which is defined once, is used as a critical thread throughout the work, as though it's a sociological phenomena. If the book had been written about that term specifically, maybe things could have been interesting.  OK, there is a period of time where one doesn't know which path to take, but I hate labels, especially cute ones, especially when applied to grown-up women facing serious challenges. I need to lead myself into new terrain, and find my own voice, and I don't need cheerleading and labels. I found the "rah-rah" attitude really lame. Worse still, the term "F-You Fifties"...I'm sorry, but I got over that language a long, long time ago. I don't think it's amusing.  One of the "success stories" was from a woman who, when she lights up her joints (marijuana) today, has much more pleasant trips. Frankly I felt offended and patronized, and I am no prude...I grew up on Ms. magazine, I went to a Seven Sister school, and I'm from NYC.  I was truly expecting More, as in that wonderful magazine for which Ms. Braun works.. 
 Yes it is true that you need special learning to understand Pound.  I did my undergraduate thesis in Pound and I am still confused.  I am now a student in Biology. Pound said (somewhere) that biologists are the best scientists because they observe the world. He thought scientists were stupid otherwise.  Since Pound I have discovered Dawkins, Ridley, William James, E. O. Wilson just to name a few authors.  They make sense to me.  Get the Cantos only if you are really dedicated to understanding one man's view of history and culture. He really believed that culture particularly past cultures affected people.  In this sense he was a behavioralist.  A little science would have helped him. This book is a throw back to the age of the oral narative when gods came down and took possession of a person. Somewhere in the Cantos he says : "The Africans have more sense than the Greeks"  who says?  Where is the proof.  He thinks he has found some. Also he writes: "We should keep our promises to the Arabs" maybe that is true.  I wonder, as a follower of Musolini would he be a follower of Osama today just to get into hot water and be controversial.  Like Homer he was blind as a bat! "A serious Character"  a biography of Pound is a good read.  
 I recently bought this book at a book store near me to try and teach myself how to draw.  I must say I was very disapointed with the text. There is more content in this "drawing" book, it seems, concerning ancient histories and theories than about drawing. If I wanted a history lesson I would buy a book by a qualified historian! Do yourself a favor and buy another book 
 This is the worst novel that I have ever read by a major author.  I have read a couple other Alex Cross novels and I did not find them to be awful at all.  They weren't very good but they kept me turning the page.  While I was reading this dreck I began to get a sense of Patterson's work ethic.  He sets a goal for himself and does not stray from it.  One maybe two chapters per day I suppose, and when his muse is on vacation for a couple of months this is the result.  Not a snowball's chance in hell that this would have been published if it weren't written by Patterson.  I'm done. Don't waste your time.  Really 
 I don't think I'm going to be around in 2025 to give an accurate evaluation .I'f I'm still here I hope I still remember who neil young is, and I'm still rocking in the free world  
 I read this book a few years ago, along with another one by the same author, Care of The Soul.  I found his books informative, though difficult to read because of the writing style.  Since, I have read many other books that address the same issues in a much "simpler form."  I noticed that the price for used books is very low, this should tell you most of what you need to know 
 Someone should actually read this book before reviewing it. Like Bill Gates, Popcorn is as wrong as she is right. Visionary? I'll tell you who the visionary is: Ted Nelson, not Faith. Cocooning? It never actually  happened as Popcorn describes it 
 I've read through several compiler texts over the past few months as I work away on a compilers project for school.  I would have to say that this text, the required textbook for my class, is not in the least bit useful.  Most of the material in the book is not covered in any real depth.  If you are looking for a useful book on compilers, I would recomend "Compilers" by Aho, Sethi and Ulman (the Dragon Book), or "Crafting a Compiler" by Fisher and LeBlanc.  Both books are much more thorough.  The Fisher's book is also quite easy to read and understand.  Appel's books only saving grace is the occasional modern view of things 
 JAK books are, imho, one of the best in the market right now.Her stories are spun from a truly talented mind, with determined yet understanding heroines and dark brooding heroes, and laced with humour and wit that never fail to bring smiles and laughter. PERFECT PARTNERS however, sadly lacked this winning JAK formula. It comes across as an absolutely frustrating novel, with a bossy and oftentimes irritating heroine, and a narrow-minded  henpecked hero.Definitely the worst JAK book around 
 I know that times were different then, and people thought so differently that it is perhaps impossible to know what actually went through their heads(Read Julian Jaynes "Origin of Consciousness"). Anyway, why it seems that philosophers like Kierkegaard can't seem to deeply bring up the question of whether Abraham was following an "authentic" inspiration of God, was a psychic event where humans evolved a sense of compassion for other humans, or was just a relatively crazy person is a mystery to me. It seems that Abraham's authority as the unintentional founder of three faiths is beyond reproach for really no good reason other than the fact that he is a fixture of tradition. Perhaps he was a fool, and perhaps more or less reasonable humans have spent a misguided number of hours, years, and lifetimes developing human thought and culture with the use of this questionable story.  	Abraham's situation is often presented as a question of ethics and faith, but really, why isn't it also a question of the usefulness, nature, and reliability of powerful psychosomatic experiences? Question the whole thing, the story itself even. Question Abraham's authenticity. Why not? Shall we grow horns and hooves if we do? No, we won't. We spend countless hours debating over what has obsessed previous humans by simply picking up the thread of logic that the last guy carried, without stepping back and looking at the blanket itself, the method of threading, the usefulness of the material, etc. There are plenty of cogent and relevant writers from the same age that don't need to be forced into being relevant. For a thinker like Kierkegaard to rationalize out of his wet paper bag by coming up with some "teleological suspension of ethics" is weak at the very best and it's a wonder why so many assume his greatness. It sounds potentially  similar to terrorist mind-sets: "I blow up cars and buildings and kill innocents because God commands me." Further, to say that in the heat of a vision of "God" one is exempt from morality, or that God is not compatible with the everyday world, is totally absurd. Philosophers astound in their ability to take themselves so seriously(me included). 	The similarity between this philosophical approach and Greek teaching-stories like Euthyphro(as mentioned in another review) is misleading. Perhaps in the end this philosophical paradox was never intended to be "solved" as many people feign to do and fool themselves into believing they have done. Rather than actually solving some Socratic conundrum- a Greek Koan- perhaps the idea is simply to engage the neutral mind by holding paradoxical and absurd situations without falling into the trap of supposed solution. Ancient Catch-22 designed to train the mind to not overreact to information by developing fuzzy and convoluted thought-patterns(i.e. "systems of philosophy"). Armchair philosophy such as Kierkegaard and Sartre and Camus lacks the practicality and internalization at the heart of Greek mystery schools of the like that Plato and Pythagorus were no doubt involved in. They were interested in transforming consciousness, not just mentalizing over absurd assumptions that assume historical situations. If, perhaps, Kierkegaard was actually a part of a truly systematic philosophy(not just one polarized in the head or victimized by discursive thinking) that included things like meditation or yoga, which even groups like the ancient Jewish community were involved in in Abraham's day, perhaps he could actually approach the real solution- which is not "be busy and overthink" but "be still and know." Two stars for effort 
 I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy  I made a mistake by buying i 
 This is the worst looking DVD I've ever seen. I loved the movie; I was delighted to see it, and bought it right away. I knew it was old and the SFX would be dated, no problem. But... watching it was like dragging fingernails over a blackboard. It jitters. It blurs. It hiccups. The color is bad.  The only other DVD I've ever run into that was even close to this bad was "The Final Countdown"; I can't help but think this DVD is actually defective in some way, except for the fact that it plays continuously without any complaints from my hardware.  So... if you loved Outland, I guess this is what you have to buy, but man... be prepared for a sub-sub-sub-optimal experience 
 I saw on the cover it said something about the New York Times bestseller list, so I kept reading (for a while) since I thought it must have something good in it to get on the list.  Well, it never did!  It's just a bunch of ridiculous long-winded drivel that couldn't get to the point.  The author dragged out the most boring unimportant acts for pages upon pages upon pages, and nothing ever happens.  The LONG descriptions are of something like Val whining ad nauseum how she doesn't want to go to this memorial service, or Jake acting crabby on the plane, or how Val sat around for hours looking at Tony's picture in her apartment, etc.  Anyway, I don't know how it got on the NY Times list, that's for sure 
 The book can be characterized as Greenspan's testimonies interspersed with the authors' interpretation of Greenspan's words in the context of what really happened thereafter. Quite interesting are Greenspan's (and not the authors') take on the 1997 Asian financial crisis and reforming Social Security, quite relevant considering W.'s desire to overhaul the system.   If the Internet has not gone mainstream, this could have been a very good book, however, Greenspan's testimonies can be readily accessible in http://www.federalreserve.gov - and a reasonably astute reader can easily do the analysis and place it in the context of what happened thereafter which is exactly what the authors did. It could have been better if the book concentrated on the inner workings of the Fed. Some anecdotes inside Fed meetings could have gone a long way.  The book also has problems with the light treatment it gives to its subject. Case in point - though it mentions that Greenspan looks at key indices and meets with the Fed governors before coming up with his testimony, it never comes around to explaining how he does it in detail.  Overall, the "Greenspan Effect" may be a good introductory primer on the Fed but its lack of focus and detail plunges it to the ranks of all those futile attempts to explain every nuance of Greenspan's pronouncements and ending up where they started. 
 If you are new to options then I don't suggest reading this book.  While the book is filled with a LOT of information about the theoretical aspects of trading options and strategies and every aspect of options in detail, I think it will turn off a lot of your newbies to option trading.  There is definetely a huge learning curve when it comes to option trading, but I think there are better, more practical ways to learn how to trade them.  This book should only be used merely as a reference guide to terminology and various strategies.  If you want to learn options, do a course like Optionetics.  But a book like this if you are trying to learn them will most probably turn you off due to the length and theoretical approach taken by the author 
 I produce motion graphics with Adobe After Effects, and have constantly run into the problem that on-line tutorials start with preparing or creating files in Photoshop first, then bringing those files into After Effects for manipulation.  When I tell people I am a videographer, so many say "oh, you must be great with Photoshop then", so finally, I decided to take the plunge and try to learn this program.  This book and the reviews here seem to me highly misleading. The book goes on at great length about out to customize your settings, or the advantage of CMYK over RGB, or "Color Management Systems Explained", but says little about how to actually USE the program. I'm brand new to Photoshop. Why am I reading about pixel and bit depth before even being shown a simple tutorial on how to get up and running with the program? This book is not for beginners.  It is also not a book for people looking to use Photoshop in conjunction with motion graphics or computer graphics.  It is a book that is dedicated to modifying/optimizing images for print, a mere fraction of Photoshop's uses/capabilities in todays graphics industry.  Also note, my wife is an experienced, professional Photoshop user (she uses it every day at her work), and she felt this review was spot on. 
 I found the book to be an exercise in academic deconstructionism. For example, the author assumed a lack of strategic flexibility on the part of Patton to deal with the static battle line.  An interesting assumption but confusing tactics with strategy, especially grand strategy, is always a problematic tendency of academics.  A career military professional will see through the rather weak argument and see the authors attempt to lable the Lorraine campaign as a "defeat". The author predicates his argument of the assumption that the Ruhr was more important than it turned out to be, that Patton was wrong concerning his belief that, if supplies had not been redirected, he could have pressed the Rhine and misses the opportunity to see the creative flexibility of the 3rd Army as it relieved Bastogne, a feat which no other allied commander believed could be done in less than 30 days. When viewed against the exploits of the 1st, 9th, and 5th Armies, it seems that the author is simply looking to write a book that will cause a stir about an American icon.  Patton was rude, crude and certainly a primodona. He was wisely never choosen as a group commander, in my opinion.  However,Patton, unlike Napolean, never lost and that is sometimes hard for "fair" minded American academics to take in light of his anti-academic approach to killing the enemy.  Unlike Eisenhower and Bradely, who were overjoyed at the taking of territory, Patton, in his and his subordinates writtings, knew that to win wars you must engage and destroy the enemy not hold territory 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I am an avid reader and a lover of books.  I will generally read anything cover to cover, whether I am enthralled in the story or forcing my way through the end of an awful yarn.  I couldn't even finish this book.  It was HORRIBLE!  I had prepared myself for a hilarious adventure (such as any of Douglas Adams' books) and instead got a disgusting, boring set of chapters that seem to have been forced onto the page by an immature, high school drama student.  Don't even bother with this book.  You'll be disappointed 
 Whats the diffrence between this and Killswitch Engage? Not much, as you thought. No mattter what other people say, this sounds just like all the other generic metalcore bands (Trivium, Chimaira, God Forbid, etc.)  Want good New Wave bands? Mastodon, Lamb of God, and Thine Eyes Bleed. Otherwise, avoid this band until they can devolope a sound thats unique 
 Typical obvious (re-)placement and (recently all too common)  Italian American as disgusting, classless, filthy villain/movie producer makes this book a real disapointment. So boring to make the Italian the new interchangeable bad white guy...tired and boring 
 I find the subject matter of the transition between the middle ages and the renaissance as a fascinating period.  This book focuses on the life and times of John of Gaunt, prince of England and the Duke of Lancaster.  One of the most powerful English Dukes who never became King, he is indeed an interesting figure and there is much of the book that is interesting in that regard.  I found the portrayal by the author of Gaunt as a pragmatist quite convincing in the context of the turbulent times that Gaunt dominated English politics.  His flirtations with the heresies of Wycliff and the patronage of the budding English humanism you find in Chaucer contrasts sharpely with a man devoted to English institutions and the well being of the Plantagenet dynasty.  There is much to recommend in this book that I enjoyed reading.  However, I found the author's writing style labored and difficult.  Some editorial comments meant to sound witty seemed out of place and detracted rather than added to the enjoyment of the book.  There were also some sentences that needed a good editor to correct some structure problems and even correct some spelling errors.  Unsupported assertions were also rife in the book.  Most disturbing was the fact that there were some significant historical inaccuracies in the book.For example, the author mentions a daughter of Gaunt and Catherine Swynford, Margaret Beaufort, who married Edmond Tudor who was the mother of Henry VII.  A little genealogical research shows that Margaret Beaufort, the mother of Henry VII was the daughter of John Beaufort, who was the son of John "Fairborn" Beaufort who was the son of John of Gaunt.  That makes Margaret Beaufort the great grand-daughter of John of Gaunt, a two generation discrepancy.  He also lists John Duke of Bedford as a grandson correctly since he was the son of Henry IV.  However he then goes on to list Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, the Duke of Bedford's younger brother, as John of Gaunt's great-grandson.  A second pair of eyes and a good editor should have been able to detect these errors and correct them.    The writing style and editing problems detract significantly from the overall historical value of this book.  If the author had remained alive, I would have hoped he would in the future revise the book, correct the problems and perhaps add some more information about Gaunt's Beaufort children and grand-children who were so significant in the political history  of England in the 15th Century.    Some day, I hope a better writer comes along and takes the subject matter Norman Cantor addressed and presents it in a more substantial and substantiated way.   
 I am very dissapointed with the poor spiral binding on this book, (4th edition)! As a dietetic student, I don't have much money to spend on books as it is. As much as this one is priced, the publishers could have put a higher quality binding on it, (or made it a paperback, like previous editions). Pages are falling out constantly, especially since it the type of book you refer to all the time 
 I have to agree with the some of the other reviewers of this movie, that it is a real stinker. And Wood Harris is not a bad actor, but in this movie he is given the impossible task of playing unarguably the best guitarist who ever lived. Jimi was one of a kind and I doubt that we will ever in our life times see another such original or innovative musician. So from the beginning, the movie is a failure in attempting to achieve something that should have never even been attempted.  And yes, the music is horrible; not even close to the beauty and passion that Jimi created. It also sort of plays fast and loose with the some of the facts of Jimi's life and does not really make the viewer understand what demons he was fighting at the end, which I believe would have made the movie so much better.  I read somwhere last year, that the Hughes Brothers were thinking about making a movie about Jimi. Well they should watch this movie and then do the exact opposite. But I really believe that it would be almost impossible to make a movie about Jimi that would be true to his life and what he stood for, and one that his fans would accept.  So I agree with some of my fellow reviewers, don't waste your money. If you want to know about Jimi and his music read ELECTRIC GYPSY or JIMI HENDRIX: MUSICIAN or Sharon Lawrence's book. And if you want to see him playing as only he could, watch Monterey Pop, Woodstock, Jimi Plays Berkley or even Band of Gypsys. 
 Timothy Leary was and remains a very controversial icon of the counterculture movement. Though his research involved the use of widely stigmatized psychedelic substances, his legacy marked the progressive movement towards realizing the therapeutic and spiritual benefits of LSD. I genuinely admire his philisophical inquiries and beliefs however was greatly disapointed with this book. I FEEL AS THOUGH THIS BOOK WHOLLY MISREPRESENTS TIMOTHY LEARY AND IN FACT CONDESCENDS HIS WORK. THE BOOK IS LITTERED WITH GRAMMATICAL ERRORS, PUNCTUATION ERRORS, MANY SPELLING ERRORS, AND FRANKLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE JARGON. I MUST SAY THAT I WAS EXTREMELY DISSATISIFED WITH THIS PURCHASE TO THE EXTENT THAT I CONTACTED RONIN PUBLISHING, INC. OVER IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA BY PHONE AND REQUESTED THE NAME OF WITH WHOM I WAS SPEAKING. When the voice on the line asked what I wanted I replied that I had purchsed "Your Brain is God" and that I wished to make a complaint because of how poorly edited the book was. THE REPLY WAS DISTINCTLY, "Go Shove Yourself Up Your ***!" and I was hung up on. I was extremely offended and do not consider Ronin an quality publisher. Nor do I recommend this book 
 I found the book to have basic common sense information, no real ideas! It was one of 3 books that I purchased and I ended up returning the book and keeping the other 2 books. But, if you need help with how to get organized,  this is the book for you! The cover and title are misleading 
 I wanted the home antenna system so I could bring my SkyFi2 receiver out of my vehicle and listen to it in the house too. I set up the antenna in a south facing window as per the instructions but soon discovered that this was unnecessary as the high gain antenna picked up the signal right through the roof with no visible or audible degradation of the signal.  Now it sits unobtrusively on top of my stereo cabinet obviating the need to route the lead wire through the house to the window. Great!  Good-bye commercial radio with all your annoying commercials and mindless, yapping, moronic DJs 
 This is one of the seminal albums of the Two-Tone movement, but don't buy this castrated version 
 Congratulations Ken Foster, on writing the most unimpressive  and uninspired collection of short stories of the last several years.   Ken Foster's book of mostly "sudden" (brief) fiction attempts to take the reader on a journey of nearly everything that's wrong in the world, but unfortunately comes across as being either completely cliche, laughably trite, or occasionally both at the same time. At times, it seems that Foster had a good scene developed in his head and quickly wrote an entire story around it, not bothering to tell the reader where the characters came from or where they are going -- not like we would care, though.  In his attempt to make his characters unique and life-like, Foster ends up supersaturating the reader in quirkiness and idiosyncracies. The book reads like an actor trying to imitate a trauma victim, spilling out all of his tormented history to the psychologist. Unfortunately, this time around, that actor isn't very good.  The stories are either too minimalistic to gather any sense of worth or momentum, or they're overkilled.  Foster's themes (and writing level) seem to be more like that of an angst-ridden teen than someone who got an MFA from Columbia. It's a wonder these stories ever got published. Foster, in all of his upscale, New York coffeehouse glory, wants to be raw and tragic. He wants his stories to be read deeply. He has thoroughly missed the mark on all counts.  What a waste of paper this book is 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 Isn't that essentially her point? How many more self-styled Zen teachers do we need to point out the obvious 
 I will give one thing to the Litter Locker: it works, and works well.  Odor is controlled better than any other system that I have tried.  BUT, it is also horrendously expensive, and I suspect that is no accident.  Overall, it is probably not worth it unless you have lots of excess cash to get rid of.  The cheapest price I found online for litter locker refill cartridges was $8 (but many places were as much as $14!).  This will last you two weeks with a single cat of average size.  So let us do the math:  $8 every other week is 26 cartridges per year, plus the $30 cost of the locker itself gives us a MINIMUM of $238 for your first year, and $208 for every year thereafter.  Unfortunately, I have 2 cats, and the litter locker is going to cost me $446 in one year!  Or, I should more accurately say it will NOT cost me that much, because I refuse to pay that much.  Obviously these guys have a racket going.  The locker could easily be designed with twice the capacity, and the refill cartridges could certainly be sold for much less.  But this is the same old gimmick that razor companies have been playing for years: get a consumer to buy their particular razor, then charge a premium for the replacement blades.  The profit is made on the blades, not the razor itself.  Likewise with the litter locker: the companys profit lies with the exorbitantly priced refill cartridges 
 This book snow-balls the reader with tons of trivial details that have little to do with clinical endodontic practice.  It provides a confusing picture of how to function clinically.  Out of touch with reality.  I don't know why it is so standard in dental schools.  Most undergraduates probably couldn't use more than 10% of it 
 As someone who has studied sociology Feagin should know that the roots of racism predate the 14th century. Racism is a part of the human condition, in fact, Black Americans who state that people of color cant be racist, are, in actuality, planting the seed of racist thought.  Feagin does not seem to understand that white's from Kant to Jefferson were actively questioning why certain races of people where seemingly culturally advanced and why others seemed to be stunted.  Throughout history people have made war or dealt in other ways with different culturers, comparison naturally begins (race being a factor of many such comparisons)..example: in the 12th century Arab traders in the South of Africa noted that the inhabitants were dirty, drank to much and behaved in a lewd manner to their own women.  Rightfully or not those traders formed a comparative opinion; much of what we now call racism is just that 
 Hi, In a nutshell, if you have a visual learner who likes colour, or one who struggles to blend this book is not for you.  My four year old was totally turned off by this so instead, we purchased the online Headsprout programme and now he is a really confident reader in a short time.  My advice is to go for a different book but if your budget allows, buy Headsprout because it is brilliant and it works.  My son loves reading because of that programme. Hope that helps you. Fay 
 I would have great things to say about this book IF I HADN'T ALREADY PURCHASED IT AS "SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE RUNNING NOOSE"! Bad form, sah! Ye'll get no stars from The Blade wi' such scurrvy tricks 
 Castillo tells a great story, even if there isn't much truth to it. Yes, all guerilla groups inevitably get involved with drugs. That's about where the truth ends. John Kerry's investigation went nowhere because there was no evidence, and he admitted that. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. also came up empty. So naturally it MUST be a dark conspiracy! Please. The contra leaders were adamant that their subordinates NOT raise money via illegal means. Besides, if the Contras HAD all of that drug money, they wouldn't have needed so much US funding. The cartels ended their association with contra armies by 1982. Bottom line: Castillo's book is not about drugs; it's a shameful attempt to rewrite history in favor of America's red enemies 
 Although Katzenbach has become one of my favorite authors, you can tell that The Traveler is only his second book.While the story is interesting, his dialogue is weak and he doesn't move the story along at a fast enough  pace. He's come a long way since The Traveler. If you like really good  thrillers, try these books by Katzenbach--Hart's War (his latest), The  Shadow Man and Just Cause 
 As a diehard Red Sox fan, how could I go wrong with a book documenting the 2004 season?  The answer:  Stephen O'Nan.  He spends more time espousing outrageous conspiracy theories (that MLB is routinely fixing games to get postseason matchups) making up silly nicknames for players that no one else on the planet uses, and generally spouting personal anecdotes that do not provide any insight or even useful description of the famed season.  Stephen King, on the other hand, does a terrific job.  Unfortunately it is O'Nan who provides the bulk of the content.  As a committed baseball fan I routinely found O'Nan's lack of understanding of the subtleties of the game to be infuriating.  Basically this guys is not qualified to be writing any sort of non-fiction book about the sport.  That said, there is one redeeming aspect (in addition to Stephen King's portions) to the book.  It brought back that wonderful season - as I plowed through, I remembered where I was and what I was doing at each critical juncture.  I remebered the anguish and the joy - conjured back by the images in the book.  Worth reading?  I think so - though I reccomend the strategy of keeping the book out and picking a chapter randomly every now and again.  This allows you to re-live the moments with small doses of O'Nan's idiocy 
 This is not the best version available of this fairytale...Stephen Carpenter's is much better.  In this version, the illustration and text don't even match.  The troll is described as having a nose as long as a poker and eyes as big as saucers...but the troll in the pictures has a bulbous nose and unremarkable eyes.  I don't know if it's an exact translation from Norwegian, but the grammar is occasionally ackward.  The metaphors in the speech given by the biggest Billy Goat to the troll have to be explained to a younger audience...which isn't bad in itself but contributes to the uneven flow in the text.  The pictures are good, too bad the writing isn't 
 I saw The House of Doors recommended on the page for the movie Cube. With Cube being one of my all-time favorite movies, The House of Doors immediately caught my interest. After reading the positive reviews, I immediately picked it up and started reading with great expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.    The novel contains some great ideas, unfortunately they are overshadowed by a couple flaws. Primarily, too much is explained too early. The antagonist and main purpose behind of the House of Doors is revealed early on, leaving little mystery for the reader to unravel. Secondly, I found the writing style to be uneven at times. The author frequently uses exclamation points and odd analogies, which often come off rather silly. It is something you do not want to see in a serious horror novel.  On another note, from the write up I was expecting the novel to contain a fair bit of horror and gore. While there are some moments, I found them to be few and far between. This did not matter to me, I was more interested in the story.  Those looking for a sci-fi adventure with some horror elements may enjoy this novel. If you are looking for a serious horror or mystery story, I recommend looking elsewhere 
 Come on if your dumb enough to think your good enough to release to cds at the same time think again. The only singeles that were good Use your illusion 1 & 2 had were not even there own they were covers. If thats not alarm bells ringing of in their head before they release it i don't know what is. If they put the best songs on 1 cd and released it would still be [...]  Thank god everyone else besides axel have had brilliant recording & releases since the break up of guns & roses, because axels a loser & everyone else deserves it for putting up with him.  And Axel if you ever read this your lucky Vince Neil didn't knock you out ya loser!!!!!!! 
      My management demanded that all of us read this book (not that long after they laid off people because they said they weren't making money). Since they were enthusiastic about this book, it's little wonder they couldn't make any money in running a business. Blanchard writes in a ridiculous style -- about sixth grade level -- with inane characters and "plot," and the examples he uses to illustrate his points fail the test of simple logic.      As noted by an earlier reviewer, you don't make money in labor-intensive businesses having people perform unnecessary jobs. I'll bypass the related fact that no one with ambition or intelligence would want to stay at any of these jobs for any length of time or work for anyone so clueless.      I've been forced to read Blanchard on at least two occasions by management in companies where I have worked. That Mr. Blanchard continues to sell books validates my opinion of most of the managers I have encountered of late in American business 
 I have the VHS tape of this movie, I really like it. I decided to buy the DVD version for better image quality and some bonus features. But I found that the image quality is not better than VHS version. And there is absolutely no single bonus feature. You can only choose, "play main feature". Even worse, it does not even have any caption or subtitle. At least the VHS had closed caption. This DVD is sort of "just watch once and throw it to the garbage can" quality. If so, why don't you buy a better featured VHS  
 I don't read many comic books, but I enjoy Batman and I enjoy talented artists.  The artwork in this comic book is awesome ... great drawings, great use of color.  The storyline, however, is amateurish.  Admittedly, you must approach all fictional writing with a degree of "suspension of disbelief", however this pushes the bounds of what is tollerable.  Spoiler: c'mon ... a 10 year old boy wants his parents to die so he can be an orphan?  And then plots his revenge against Bruce Wayne for 25+ years after his Bruce's dad was able to save the mother?  DESPITE now himself being a world famous physician?  The plot brings every villan into suspicion ... seems like a weak attempt to get all of Batman's most famous enemies on the cover to sell more comics.  The writer gave us no sense of the torment of the antagonist, no real motive.  Were his parents abusive?  Why the displaced agression towards Bruce?  The writer wasted valuable storyline on dead ends rather than building real suspense and drama.  I am going to continue to read Batman graphic novels in hopes that there is something better than this out there.  I wished the writing lived up to the art work 
 i'm a potential buyer of business with some knowledge of the overall process including valuations after reading Robb's excellent but outdated book on business. I thought i needed to know more about the valuation aspect. However while usefully illustrating the vagueness of the process, this book by  Feldman accomplishes nothing substantive other than free advertising. Their dismissiveness of some types of modelling with a continual substitution of their own process, which they do not explain & is i suspect subject to similar criticisms, is patronising. All models have problems & they need to recognise this, as the basic tools used to arrive at complex formulas are common to all.  There are some examples which make you feel comfortable & in touch with reality, useful for one scared by the financial process,  but too much is repetitive, & really really this can all be condensed. For those who want the condensed version here goes:  "Plan your business methods well before sale date. Minimising tax also decreases value, because earnings appear to be lower. There are flaws with earnings multiple based valuations. By contrast, & see the appendix to every chapter, our online system is flawless but we're not going to explain it. Brokers also cost more than our system. Go online & buy it."   I know this book has been given 5 stars, but if you have any knowledge at all or  are averse to advertising at your own expense try another book first! Whatever happens you should definitely buy another book after you have sampled this one. 
 This book has some great content; however, as a Mac user, I was disappointed that nowhere does the author point out cross-platform differences. I realize Windows is the dominant OS, but Acrobat is just as much (if not more, as a a percentage) used on the Mac. Shame on the author for not even bothering to mention the differences 
 With the other reviews I read before buying this book, I thought this must contain some groundbreaking techniques, but I was surprisingly disappointed instead. It was more like hyped-up motivational stuff, along with fairly obvious advice along the lines of: Be outgoing, be nice to people, be interested in others, be helpful, present yourself well, etc. I can't say this isn't good advice, but it's not exactly breakthrough. The author also continuously throws in various odd trademarked slogans like "Be Progress". If someone needs basic motivation to get out and confront talking to people, and present themselves well, maybe this book is helpful. Perhaps there isn't a lot more to this subject that anyone could write a good book about 
 this cd, is basically have some japanese music turned english. my responses, its okay ecept for the fact that since im japanese i more use to japanese language for tese music. i personally think the english songs on this album are hard to listen to, too soft and overall not japanesey "not a word" but basically stick to japanese when making japanese music and i speaking to avex, or sweetbox jade couod've made her own song instead of ruin a nice japanese song. the piano song is really great and to you was also, and if you are going to buy advent children i reccomend you import it because english ruin the characters voice, and teh characters are japanese so why change their voice to english, did they go to english skool 
 My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.  Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.  Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.  TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 I had high hopes for this book as I thought it would address spirituality in a humanistic way.  At first, I thought I agreed with the 'accepting of self' philosophy, but gradually statements made by the author just didn't ring true.  I kept on thinking that maybe I was resistant to the reevaluation of my own thought processes, but gave up when the author spoke of a patient who found out her husband was cheating on her and the author's response was that she had control issues (!?!) and was acting like a victim.  I think at that moment, perhaps she feeling victimized.  But instead of telling her to 'embrace her victim', she is a control freak. Then he presents depression like it is some kind of choice, instead of a chemical imbalance.  Perhaps depression can spawn creativity, but you have to be able to get out of bed first -- and that is a problem.  I gave up on the book after that 
 Be careful with this program.  My wife bought it, and I tried to install it for her on our PC.  I made several attempts, and each time installation hung at a different stage of the installation procedure.  When installation hung, I could not cancel or kill it, or even shut down the PC without pressing the Reset button (on Windows XP Pro).  I went to the support page of the web site, and found a FAQ item about incompatibility with Zone Alarm.  If you're not familiar with Zone Alarm, it is a personal firewall and security product that is very common among home users.  According to Nova Development, the only way to get Scrapbook Factory Deluxe 3.0 to install is to permanently remove Zone Alarm.  Besides being a serious security risk, this is an extreme measure to have to take.  This seems to be perfectly OK with Nova Development.  They offer no workaround other than removing Zone Alarm from the PC.  Personally, this would be enough to give me pause about installing the product even if I did not use Zone Alarm.  You have to wonder what the installer is trying to do that even the presence of dormant security software interferes with it.  
 I can't believe that this is recommended reading for grade 9 and up. Had I been assigned this for reading at grade 9, I would have read as much as necessary to get a C on whatever project was associated with the assignement and not felt the least bit of guilt.  Fast forward to the present...I picked this book up (only b/c I've seen a number of references to it) and forced myself to complete it (reading 3 or 4 other books in between - which is indicative of its ability to capture the average reader's interest).  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book for reading if you're a passive literary buff.  But if you want to say you've read an author's author (for casual conversation) or you are given this as assigned-reading (lucky you!), then you're going to have to make an effort to stay awake. This book can easily lose you (and your interest) with its level of detail. The story is very basic - family cheats another family; cheated family curses cheating family; cheating family experiences generations of misfortune - but the message, theme, etc. gets lost in the soup of details.  Don't be suckered into thinking this is any kind of supernatural thriller. It's definitely not scarey and is far from a thriller. One prop I will give is the description of the house has seemed to make it into every B-horror-flick (either in look or spirit) I've seen 
 For the last 2 years I have listened to about 1 audio book per week and this takes first place as the worst of the lot. The exercises in this audio book are trivial and insulting. Save your money 
 Paul Johnson's History of the Jews seems to start well: to a layman, at least, there is a sense of balance - but then it is hard to take the uprising against Zedekiah personally, and while of course it could, under duress, be made to read as a trope for various political tendencies, the author wisely shows little interest in giving the incident a partisan colour. Modern history, however, gets a far different treatment.   The Ashkenazim were often characterized by anti-Semites as "cunning"; recent scholarship shows that, in fact, the isolation and other unusual conditions to which they were subject over generations inclined them not only towards certain diseases (almost 60% of Ashkenazi suffer from genetically-linked alleles) but also towards higher intelligence than other European males: almost 15 IQ points above the average verbal and mathematical scores, although they tend to have visuospacial scores slightly below the average (see "Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence", Journal of Biosocial Science, June 2005). Little wonder, then, that Jews were enthusiastic participants in the explosion of new ideas that followed the Enlightenment.   These Jews, from Spinoza on, are given increasingly heavy-handed treatment. While it is normal for an author to have his personal preference - in Johnson's case, for the religious over the secular, the moderate over the radical, and the conservative over the progressive - Johnson's Jew is the product of a dangerously nostalgic mis-remembering. Can it be anything other than deeply and insultingly patronizing for a Gentile author to engage, albeit from some supposedly philo-Semitic motive, in the taxonomy of Jews into self-hating and non-? It is a meaningless exercise at best; would anyone ever think to call Luther a self-hating Catholic? Or Galileo?   At worst, it belies the very philo-Semitism it supposedly characterizes. Why is Rosa Luxembourg a self-hating Jew? Because her politics don't match Johnson's own? Or, more disturbingly, because she doesn't match his image of the meek and dutiful Jew, happily occupied with his scrolls and his flat bread? This stereotypical Jew is sometimes known, in my (admittedly assimilated) circles, as the Williamsburg Jew because, although people imagine they will find him in Brooklyn, in fact he is unlikely to exist outside the implications of the Virginia tourist attraction of the same name.   Luxembourg's statement, on which Johnson hangs the self-hating epithet, that she is only as concerned about the troubles of Jews as she is about the troubles of all oppressed peoples, is obviously Communist in its inspiration - and therefore anathema to the author - but it is nonetheless completely rational and, it should be pointed out, not incompatible with the Jewish mission to serve as an example. Why is a rational Jew self-hating - because he might make trouble for the Goyim? There is something of the minstrel show about Johnson's model of the modern Jew, something that undermines irretrievably the book as a whole 
 Come on!!! Isn't the album and enough example of this whole new "Booga Booga Hugga Hugga" caveman project?.. Jump off the wagon Bjork and try to create something new!!!  I absolutely understand that it's not easy to create something new.but I also think that not every idea that pops must be developed to continue a success..  What I really think  about the "Medulla" project -a part of it-..is just  a waste of extensive effort,unique lyrics,superb coporations,rebelious ideas and artistic portraits...just like preparing "sophisticated" recipies with expired ingredients..     This is way too much to hold on with..  I mean it's way too native for me and not qualified for continuous listening.. I want my (Vaspertine/Homogenic/Post/Dancer In The Dark)Bjork back..Not her Grand Grand Grand...etc (1000000 times) MOTHER!  I heard rumors that most acapellas of "Medulla" might be remixed and represented... But after waiting then buying the latest two singles:(Who Is It/Triumph Of A Heart)...I began to realize that she still enjoys this freaky destination of creepness she's cutting through..  BY exceptioning the "Oceania" improvement with Kelis,nothing till now between  Bjorks hands amused me ....  I'll keep on  waiting for better releases with a fact that one day, she will reach a point of creepness that will give her the creeps!! 
 Doyles section is basically the same and is why it got 2 stars in the first place. I feel the poker pros were not used properly for this book. Daniel negranu is a coward for  doing three card draw that has no merit on real card tables and he should of just declined it in the first place,he is a no limit and omaha 8 or better expert and should of wrote on that instead. Bobby baldwin was the most sound poker player during his time, kind of like alan cunningham of today. So I dont know why he didnt write the limit chapter again,  I think modern day limit players would have really been in for a treat. I have nothing against jeniffer harmen writing it but I think it was better served for baldwin. Please save your money and dont buy this book. If need be they should have it at your local library 
 Exactly. This is what the book looks like if you go to a store right now and open it. This book is virtually a math book although physics is about 60% math and 30% science information, this book is like 95% to 5%. Not only that the explainations for some of the problems are really bad. The reason why people think physics is hard is b/c of books like these that make it hard. THEIR are even mistakes in the formulas they use and they dont round numbers to significant digits. Im the top of my class in physics only b/c i like science, this book can change your mind real fast. The book does not explain who and how which is vital in learnig and passing any science test. For example Isaac Newton proposed the law of gravity. It just tells you concepts and terms that came from nowhere. The only good part about it is webassign that lets you practice problems online. d 
 This book should have been written in the third person, or better yet, by an unbiased third party. After reading several chapters, I concluded that the book should have been entitled "How great I am, or why I am the best GM that ever lived." A more modest approach to reviewing his success with the Atlanta Braves would have been nice. Sorry to be so negative about this book, because I really admire Schuerholz and all he has accomplished in baseball. But a little humility would have gone a long way 
 Story starts with a good idea, a 'Nick Fury' ripoff main character and goes absolutely nowhere.  Once you get to the 'shootout' at the space station, you're pretty much done.  What a waste of a good idea 
 While the author heaps truckloads of eulogies about "honor, integrity and deep moral convictions" on a man whom Gen. Douglas MacArthur should have hanged as a traitor, the fact is, it was Truman's flagrant disregard for the U.S. Constitution that gave him the "fortitude" to support the invasion of a foreign nation. The 1st Amendment, as we all know, clearly states, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion..."  While everyone is at liberty to endorse and support whatever religious cause or organization they choose, our government is supposed to remain neutral on such matters.  As was the case with Harry "atomic bomb" Truman, left wingers always refer to the first amendment when it serves their purpose to subvert our institutions but always flagrantly violate it when it is convenient for them to do so.  To refer to Harry Truman, who was directly responsible for the systematic slaughter of American soldiers during the Korean War, the Massacre at Hiroshima, the betrayal of China to his Communist friends, the communising of Europe, as a man motivated by deep moral conviction, humanitarianism, etc, is enough to make anyone puke 
 A professor highly recommended this book to my art history class. I  was disappointed in it. I had hoped it would offer some useful advice but instead it merely outlines the things anyone writing on a college level (and the book seems to be aimed at college students) should already know. Perhaps it would be better suited to high schoolers 
 This book was interesting but midway through the book I wanted to tell him to get a real life and job in his educational background.  Sadly, I felt he never really achieved his real ability and just had a lot of excuses 
 It paused and skipped through the whole DVD, except for the interviews with other people, at the beginning. I was really disappointed with the quality of the DVD. This includes both DVD's. 
 Gilles Kepel is a really bright person, but this is one terrible book.  His idea is that Muslims may reject violence as counterproductive and instead achieve the acceptance of their wisdom by convincing us all.  In return for accepting their wisdom, they will accept our advice to be non-violent about it.  As for those who reject the truth of what they have to say, well, they'll simply shame us all into accepting their wisdom.  Did I use the word wisdom a little too much?  If so, it is because I think this book needs more of it.  Much more of it.  Kepel never seems to get around to condemning Arab propaganda.  And in an age where the international information supply has been seriously contaminated by arbitrary antizionist untruths, I think this is a serious oversight.  First we see Kepel misrepresent the 2000 Intifada as the work of Sharon, who clearly provoked the Arabs by visiting the Temple Mount, and Arafat, who clearly provoked the Jews by killing them in bunches.  But this is nonsense.  Jewish members of the Knesset had been visiting the Temple Mount, which is Judaism's holiest site, on a regular basis.  If non-Muslims were to start a war just because an Arab leader visited the Kaaba, we'd all regard this as an absurd excuse.  Kepel just adds to the problem by pretending that this is reasonable.    This is a serious problem with the whole book, because truth is central to the theme.  If Muslims are going to support truth, they may get their way without violence.  If they are fighting truth, they will not be able to convince others or shame them into agreeing.  The only options left will be violence or apology.  The author is convincing when he says that Israeli settlements do annoy some Arabs.  Now, these settlements are on disputed land.  They ought to be as legal as Arab settlements.  But let's forget all that.  Let us think only of justice and truth and human rights.  Here is where Kepel falls apart.  He keeps implying that in a just world, Israel would be trimmed down to size.  And that even if the settlements are legal, if Israel had to fend for itself, without anyone supporting it or attacking it, the size of Israel would decrease to something more reasonable.    Kepel has it totally wrong.  Israel has over 6 million people and over 5 million Jews.  In a just world, all else being equal, Israel would be much bigger.  And this is the core of the problem.  The present size of Israel is not a crime against Nature.  If anything, it is like low tide at the beach: one is making a big mistake if one expects the water to recede from it for the rest of the day.  The author admits that some folks support Israel here.  But he blames this support on a few "neoconservatives," implying that they are fighting against reality.  The truth is that the Arab side is fighting against justice and reality, and that such a war can't be won in the long run.  Once Kepel avoids saying that in a just world, Israel would be much bigger, it is easy for him to present Muslim violence as the wrong means for antizionist Muslims to convince others of their essential reasonableness.  And in his discussion of Europe, he concludes that European Islam will emerge with a "universalist perspective, freed from the straitjacket of authoritarianism and corruption."  Now, I do admit that the author is a learned and intelligent person.  And he may be right!  But as far as I am concerned, he could not have made a less convincing case.    
 The problem with being self-righteous is that, in time, people discover you're hypocrite. Way to cheat on your wife Bill. Now, go after someone who doesn't exercise your idea of family values 
 That moron who said their music hasent changed is so dumb and obviousley not a true SOAD fan. Ive been a SOAD fan since they were just a small band with loads of potential. SOAD was a great album and Toxicity was sweet and Steal This Album was really a great musical adventure but this album just isnt SOAD at all. Ok in all fairness if I was writing this review and this was their debut album great album overall reallly a 4.5/5 truthfully. But compared to their earlier work this just doenst cut it, their older stuff was way way better then this crap. And Daron should stop trying to get so much singing time in he really isnt that good of a singer and Serj is much better 
 We puchased three of them.  The first two "burned out" after about 45 min. the first time they were used.  The other one did the same the second time used. Would certainly not recommend it 
 Even with the promise of Chevy Chase dying in the first reel, this film is so dumb and bad. It's easy to think that Benji typed this film all by himself. Except he would have eliminated Chevy's voiceover. I was so expecting to enjoy this film as a cheesy cinema classic, but it was too painful to be fun. Chevy Chase films like vinegar remains bitter no matter how old it gets 
 This is a very jargon-based book. The author likes to use symbols or what so called algebra representation for many of the mathematic terming particularly in matrix representation. This make the book not worthy to buy. Author should use number in mathematic representations rather algebra so that readers can have quick grasp over the topics, but the author didn't. Most often time you have to imagine yourself what are the 'pictures' that the author tries to tell you.   To me, a good book must not to be too jargon-based, no long story, straight forward, and use simple example but still can let one apply it to complex situation later. For example, why should use a + b = c by right it is best to explain it with 1 + 1 = 2? Because using numeric number as example is easier and faster to understand, once the reader understand, then automatically they can apply it using a + b = c. Unfortunately, this book does not fulfil this requirement. This is why I am not very happy with the book because what normally the readers wish from the book is to have as fast possible in grasping the knowledge and apply it as soon possible, but not to sit around to think and analyze things for long time.  Further, author assumes you know quite number of things(especially programming using OpenGL API) before you can start programming following the guide of the book. The book is not as comprehensible even for some of the advance graphic students as the examples given is really difficult to understand (particularly graphics algorithm). Again, without simple and comprehensible examples, you have to use your own imagination to figure it out and most often time you may not able to do so due to the complex nature of the theories.  Many computer science students have claimed that the computer graphics is a 'killer subject'. From the feedbacks I have gathered so far, I found that all they are using this book as a core text book. To be fair, this book may suitable for computer graphic students with one condition, that a good instructor who are really expert in this area is with you, as warned by the other reviewer before.  So, buy this book only if you are not learning computer graphic yourself, and you must have a very good instructor/teacher/lecturer in this area. Otherwise, do not buy this book 
 The format of this novel is indeed innovative.  However, the words the characters purportedly write in their journals, or tell to the story's journalist, are contrived and not credible.  Also, some of the passages (such as the Sikh character's tale of the anti-Sikh pogroms in 1984 following the assassination of Indira Gandhi) seemed to be included not because they develop the story, but rather because the author thinks the reader ought to know the history in detail.  Is this book trying to be a novel, or a William Dalrymple wanna be?  It's like attending a presentation given by someone who is excited about his/her topic, but cannot seem to realize that what he/she knows and what the audience wants are quite different.  We can absorb history as part of a novel without being hit over the head and lectured about it 
 I read this book when I was in grade school, and I have to say that it is pretty warped. This isn't just about children playing with toys that come to life when they are not around. Despite the impression you might have gotten from other reviews, this is NOT like "Toy Story." The dolls have their own personalities, yes, but they are not all nice. Marchpane is not just spoiled and "delicate" she is evil. She is a sociopath who goads the little boy doll into literally playing with fire. The boy's mother, Birdie, sacrifices her own life to save her son. The book plays it up as some great moral maternal thing, but for all intents and purposes, Marchpane murders her. The death is gruesome, with Birdie burning alive into a pile of dust while her husband and son look on with horror and Marchpane remarks remorselessly that if Birdie had been made of more quality materials, like Marchpane herself, she would not have died. This book really affected me as a child, and not in a good way. I scarcely remember the rest of the plot, but Birdie's death is an image that will always stay with me. If I could rate it with zero stars, I would. DO NOT buy this for a child 
 As an introduction Zen, what has been presented in this book is fine though it could have been done with lot less elitist overtone. I agree Zen and its true comprehension does not come easy (I am talking of regular mortals such as myself here) and words as mere symbols for concepts are distorting when conveying Zen.   I do not propose that I am an expert on Zen or even Buddhism in general but I have read a few books on Buddhism by Thich Nhat Hanh, Dalai Lama, Chogyam Trungpa and others. Though an agnostic who does not care for much for organized religion, I do believe the most fundamental benefit of any spiritual/ religious framework is to instill a sense of compassion toward other beings. You need some kind of cultural creation (religious or otherwise) to counter act the natural tendency of a human to be self-serving. In this aspect, I have high regards for non-theistic Buddhism and the inclusiveness of Vedanta (Hinduism) that proposes all religions eventually lead to the same attainment. From this viewpoint I was surprised with this author.  This author may have been one of the leading authorities on Zen in his time, but unfortunately he comes as an arrogant, elitist, full of prejudices. He does not miss any opportunity to put down other religions or even other sects of Buddhism. Only Zen as practiced by the Rinzai sect is pure, strong and generally worthy of pursuit. Any form of spiritualism from the West is of course hopeless since the western mind cannot escape the conditioning of logical thinking.  Any spiritualism from India is complex, ceremonial and not practical. Other sects of Buddhism generally do not have true comprehension, lost their way focusing on non-essentials etc. He reserves his most disparaging remarks for Indian religions and monks (and does his best to show that though Buddhism originated in India, it is really the Chinese and Japanese due to their practical nature made something of it).  Is this just the standard fundamentalism/ misplaced racism?  I will definitely read other books on Zen and go beyond this author. 
 This was the word used by one reviewer, and it just about sums up the film. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head by saying that many young wannabe creative persons start off with highly auto-biographical and introspective pieces of work. Usually these are binned, as the person matures. Asia seems to have the advantage of a parental environment sufficiently indulgent and well-heeled to let her have her way on film, instead of on scraps of paper like the great majority. But good art is more than self-expression, self-promotion, self-pity and self-indulgence. It should have a satisfying underlying form, say something new to its audience, expose some as yet unperceived truth about life and humanity. Art is boring if it merely tells us something we already know, especially if it's told in a semi-familiar way. Most of what Asia says in this film we do already know, if we are half-aware of what goes on around us. Still, the girl has a cute face, and she's put a lot of effort into this performance. Something more may come with time.

 Noam hates the western world all the while living in america and enjoying the conforts of western civilization. Maybe he should live in a communist country to get some perspective on what his ideas amount to.  Some people have told that I dont really know what I am talking about here. I can only recommend them to read what Noam wrote about Cuba. Hope to see you there Noam 
 Well I just woke up from a long nap after trying yet again to *yawn* read a chapter of this *yawn* book.  Definitely not nearly enough bananas or geese in it for me.  If you want to hear long drawn-out stories about getting files from government agencies....well all I'm saying is  I guess my primary interest in Lennon has always been his music and I just don't give a hoot about this stuff-- not enough entertainment value.  I thought the book "The day Elvis Met Nixon" was much better.  Oh go ahead write me a negative response 
 When I read a review of this book, I was interested and checked it out of the library. It was a quick and easy read, and, unfortunately, also a disappointment.  In author Shellenbarger's favor, it must be said that the book is literate, well-organized and based on a reasonable methodology of data collection. It even has footnotes. It categorizes female midlife crisis into specific types, and gives defining examples of each.  However, _The Breaking Point_ is also quite superficial, despite a few offhand references to Jungian psychology. After awhile, the collected personal stories which are used as examples start to sound like a litany of airheaded people who made bad decisions (dropped out of college to get married, married emotionally remote men, tried to mold themselves according to other people's expectations) and eventually wound up paying the price. The book also has virtually no perspectives that are not rooted in the last 50 years of human experience, which makes it difficult to take seriously.  I am a 52-year-old woman, recently retired, and I find it impossible to identify with these people. I also find it absolutely astonishing that anyone should find the notion of continued personal growth a radical solution to any problem.  This book may possibly be of assistance to women who are like those the author interviewed. There is at least one piece of sensible advice herein: throwing yourself into a series of sexual or romantic affairs may be dangerous to your mental health and your marriage.  Sorry, Sue, nice concept, weak execution.   
 I'm always looking for ways to make coding work better, at any level from nanosecond arithmetic operations to decade-long enterprise operations. I didn't find much of use here, but there were a few good points here (very few). Let me start with those.  The "Execute Around Method" pattern is good idea, applicable far beyond this Smalltalk context. The Beta language has "inner" inheritance, which makes the idea easy, but most other languages lack a good mechanism for undefined logic between matched operation pairs (open/close, setup/cleanup, etc.) "Enumeration" is another good one, enshrined as "Visitor" in the Gang of Four book.  Most of what's left is either trivial or Smalltalk-specific and face it, Smalltalk is mostly a cult language with nearly no commercial significance. The Smalltalk pretty-printing and variable-naming rules, fatuous at best, are just not applicable to most langages. Some of Beck's "practices" are language features (like 'super'). Other "practices", like the long chapter on Collections, seem to describe standard library classes and messages. Yet others (e.g. Type Suggesting Parameter Name) correct language defects - Smalltalk chose to give up the error detection capability offered by variable typing. Beck tries to sneak it back in with variable naming conventions sort of like Microsoft's old Hungarian naming. Some of his suggestions are just dangerous, like that one that says a constructor should "half-way construct an object in one place, then pass it off to another to finish construction. (p.23)" This distributes an object's setup responsibility across its client classes, leaves unusable and incomplete objects floating around, and causes subtle exposures in multithreaded systems - I'd rip out any code I saw built this way.   The good news is that no new trees died to make my copy of this book - I got it used, and it's returning to the used market. At least my conscience is clean on that account, no matter what I'm doing to the poor guy who buys this book next.  //wiredweir 
 I love the lenses but these goggles are painful to wear.  I tried various adjustments but they are still too uncomfortable.  I sent an email to Speedo  to let them know. 
 I love this unit.  It's great.  Interestingly, it is much smaller than I thought it would be.  The sound is great, nice and full for such a small unit.  Even though I won't use the ear bud phones, they have really good sound.  It works nicey, the buttons aren't difficult to engage, it is easy to get used to;  all the recording and editing functions are easy to access.  I can't comment on the computer applications I havent' tried them yet.  But the beep is driving me nuts.  I have never had a walkman (or minidisc recorder) that beeps (so loudly) when you hit play, stop, forward and reverse (to the next track).  And worst of all, don't hit the pause button while playing:  it will beep intermittently, continuously.  How could Sony possibly have included such an annoying function.  When playing through a stereo using the headphone out (there is no other line-out) the sound output is rather low that you need to turn your stereo up loud and that beep is deafening.  Yikes!  If anyone knows how to disable this noise, please let me know  [... 
 The entire book is easily summed up with four words.  "I didn't do it. 
 Given that Professor Dahl has written numerous books on democracy and is considered an expert in the field, "On Democracy" is surprisingly uninteresting. The book covers various aspects of democracy (history, preconditions, systems of government, elections, and its relationship to capitalism) superficially. With the exception of a few (very occasional) facts, the book provides little beyond what an educated person with an interest in democracy (e.g., college and reads the newspaper) already knows.  Part of the problem is the writing: it is meandering, thus the book's 200 pages are not enough to go into any issue in depth. Part of the problem is a lack of focus, for example, Dahl spends several pages trying to show that assembly based democracy is not practical for large populations (which should be obvious), while not a single page on how democracies in practice assess the opinions of large populations (e.g., polling, districting, etc.).  A deeper problem may simply be that Dahl is a political "scientist". Law and economics seem to have long since stripped polisci of logic and empiricism, both of which are missing here.  Why two stars (instead of one)? The book is well organized and does provide a framework for thinking about democracy; Dahl just never develops it 
 This is realy a PR puff for Marc Andressen and Netscape masquerading as a history. Despite its title the book is startling for its ommissions. Tim Berners-Lee's invention of the Web is given minimal mention, he is mainly mentioned in sniping attacks by Marc and Co.   The list of people the book ignores is very long, Dan Connoly and Dave Raggett who were the driving force behing HTML, Robert Cailiau whose support allowed the Web to continue. Yuri Rabbinski, Henryk Nielsen, Ari Luotenon,  Roy Fielding and so on.  Not only does the book ignore these people the ommission is delinerate. Tim was never approached for interview nor were most of the real architects of the Web. Unfortunately the book is just one more of a long line of rather sad demonstrations of the effect sucess can hav 
 I would strongly discourge using this book to try and learn mass transfer. We used this book in Purdue's mass transfer course and the classmates I spoke with agreed -- this book was extremely confusing and took a "hand wave" approach when solving the difficult mathematics.  A much better book is Transport Phenomena by Bird, Stewart, and Lightfoot 
 A perusal of this book reminds me of a UK television show on which James "The Amazing" Randi, pretending to be a "medium," brilliantly and devastingly showed just how easy it is to be fooled by those who claim to talk to our dead relatives for us.  It seems that the need to believe, the craving to hang on and not let go, is powerful enough to bypass logic and rational thinking in our poor benighted species.  I would urge anyone considering laying out their hard-earned money to this or other "mediums" to do a little research into the "cold reading" trick and how it works.  There are many ways to deal with grief and loss that do not involve superstition, credulity or hefty amounts of cash.   
 Extremely lengthy, considering that it takes 250 pages to get to the "crime", and nothing of importance is revealed after reading 500+ pages. Too many major deviations from the spacer/settler universe,  including appeal to deus ex machina type plot devices. Asimov would have  hurled. Given all that, I will probably end up reading the next book, if  only to finish answering the questions left hanging. If you haven't started  reading Vol 1 yet, don't 
 If you must watch this film, watch it for Winkler, who gives an interesting preview of his future role in "Arrested Development".  Watching this movie for "Prinz" and "Stiles" is counterproductive.  Not only have the actors "failed to make the best" of the script, the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich Hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences.  Thus, we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school, muse about becoming "singer-songwriters", and "stop paying attention" to their college plans.  Much like the "Friends" genre that this movie shamelessly imitates, this is a "time porn" piece, where the characters have little else to do besides "mature romantically" and "find themselves".  A movie for history's circular file 
 Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!  Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting 
 I was very disappointed by this book lack of warning of its religious premise.  It is not necessary to be religious or Bible savvy in order to be a homeschooler or organized.  If a book is going to quote the Bible so many times it ought to warn the readers on the back cover.  The copy I got offered no warning at all and it wasn't until the second page that I realized that this book was not for me.  I have nothing against religion but, a book that uses it to justify the meaning of homeschooling or being an organized parent is useless to me and others like me.  The author and publisher should have been more upfront about it 
 Rival,  Do yourself a favor a take this electric skillet off the market asap!  You should offer a $50 rebate coupon for every poor soul who purchased your junk product - starting with me.   After 5 uses, the heating element stopped working and could not be fixed. Before it broke, the non-stick surface ended up with several of our meals.  You guys ever heard of a six-sigma program?

 Michael Moore Hates America. This is evident in all of his movies and also proven when he goes oversees to make money by badmouthing us here at home. If you want to waste your money to see a film so horribly slanted in his own opinion, with quotes taken out of context...then by all means buy this collection. If you want to really find out what Michael Moore is up to...go to Moorelies.com...or read "Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man." You can find the book here at Amazon.com and I promise it will be a better way to spend your hard earned money. 
 i love to read jackie collins book's and i have liked everyone of them, but for some reason this book is really boaring to me. i expected better. This is book was not as enjoyable to read as her other books, so if this was your first jackie collins book and you didnt like it then i suggest you keep reading because this is her worst 
 This is a sprawling, lazy account. It was moderately useful as a complement to Donald Prater's far more concentrated 'A ringing glass', but if I hadn't read that book first I wouldn't have formed much of a picture of Rilke's life. There are a few interesting stories found here which don't  appear in the other book, but on the whole it is totally inferior 
 Our dvd starts, and explains all of the rules, lets you choose a game and see the categories, but does not let you choose a category. Once we press enter to begin, it goes straight to the very first start up screen. 
 i wasn't very impressed.  i bought the book for an airplane ride and was very disappointed to find how often the author wrote (these are examples) "you can find great ones online" or "skin care tips online" or "list of top best photogs worldwide online."  i didn't have a computer and i wanted to know what they were talking about.  if you don't have access to a computer 24/7 this book is not for you.  EVEN if you have access to a computer 24/7 this book is not for you cause than you CAN look it all up 
 Three problems with this film:  1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.    2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.    3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.    Don't waste your life.  ALon 
 Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...  If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you.   This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.  I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.  Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation

 I ordered this and got a version from Beverly Wilshire Filmworks, not the version in the Amazon product listing. This is a cotinuing problem if you order used Hong Kong films. You order the film used and dont get the advertised version and instead get a cheap (maybe even illegal) copy. It is a grainy pixalated version with blurry lines across the screen. Amazon really needs to crack down on this and make them specify or ensure that you only get the advertised version 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 How sad it is read such a poorly written and conceived book about such an interesting subject!  This book is a tragic waste of wonderful material.  I hope that another biographer with greater literary skills decides to take  on Armand Hammer 
 There are only 1 or 2 short topless scenes and a few crappy death scenes. The death scenes are boring and plain. This movie had so much promise but fell so short. I wouldn't watch it this movie on cable let alone pay for it 
 Sports and movies - should be a PERFECT combination.  Especially a story of a true sportsman, a true gentleman of the game, someone who loved to play the game for the game itself.    But this movie doesn't spend enough time telling us about the real Bobby Jones.  It leaves us hanging and wondering. There is one point where he is playing with a woman golfer and she is refered to as his girlfriend - WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?  At another point, he is in the hospital, temporarily banned from the game.  Then flip to him writing a letter of apology, then flip to him playing golf.  Well what happened to the hospital stay?  What happened to his ailment?  How did he get better, is it a long time/term disability?  Later, he and his wife are arguing over him going to another tournament and then PRESTO there they both are at the match.    Scenery - beautiful.  Story - while interesting it leaves viewer disappointed.  It should just be, could just be so much more.  
 For those of you looking for more Eva action after seeing the original series take heed. DON'T BUY THIS DVD! The Death part of the DVD, part 1, is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season, and the second half, Rebirth, part 2, is new stuff, very good, BUT! If you buy 'The End of Evangelion' you get Rebirth AND a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material. So, don't buy 'Death&Rebirth'. Buy 'The End of Evangelion' instead 
 This is quite possibly the most poorly written book I have ever seen. Like others on this site I will never again read a DS book. Talk about repetitive -- it got so bad that I began to underline everytime the main love interest was referred to as a "wacky artist". Between Chapters 5 and 7 the term was used 15 times, three times on one page. To make it worse, the "wacky artist" is also characterized as extremely immature and childlike, making him very unappealing to me, anyway. In the space of 3 pages the following phrases appear -- "looked like a big kid", "she felt like his mother", "his childlike style" "he was very needy sometimes, and self-centered, as children are", "he acted like a bored schoolboy", "pouting", "acted out, more often than not, like a child". What a bore. Both the book and the people in it 
 The main thing about this book is that it could have used a better editor than it got.  There are run-on sentences.  Sentences are repeated.  Paragraphs are repeated or reiterate information already given.  There are grammatical errors that made me ashamed for Anne Rice. Basically it reads as though there was a deadline and the manuscript had to be rushed to the presses as it was, without someone to read it and make sound-minded decisions on how it should read as a serious work of fiction.  The Witching Hour is formulaic.  The author basically rushes through the generational histories of the Mayfair witches in a race to get to the last and present matriach sorceress, Rowan Mayfair.  This is a pity because Rowan Mayfair is hardly more than her name--she is that flat of a character.  Her witch-ancestresses were much more interesting and Rice does have a gift for writing historical periods with deft and charming detail.  Several good books could easily have come from the ancestral storylines.  Although it purports to be science fiction, The Witching Hour is actually a gothic romance, which is basically pornographic fiction for women.  For this reason, there is an unusual amount of sex in this book.  Science fiction readers may be uncomfortable with this element since it is not the norm for the sci-fi genre to be this steamy and besotted.  Also curious for a book that has New Orleans for a setting is the complete absence of African-American characters.  The city of New Orleans is a famous home of the Voodoo religion which has African roots.  Voodoo itself was popularized by an African-American Voodoo priestess by the name of Marie Laveau, a New Orleans native and resident.  Curiously, Rice makes no mention of this vital history even as she uses the city's mystical and magical glamour as a backdrop for her story.  I think this is because Rice cannot write about poor people.  Invariably, her characters are rich and powerful.  They have power beyond ordinary power--they are witches, and they live lives of instant wish-fulfillment in which they can immediately have whatever they want.  Character development does not seem to be very important to Rice.  At least not in this book.  This novel could have used some good revisions.  I would like to see some of the storylines developed into fuller, book-length stories.  If you are frustrated by badly written books, then skip The Witching Hour.  I recommend you read The Book of Spirits by James Reese, or Voodoo Dreams, by Jewel Parker Rhodes 
      For those of you who have sincerely been seeking the truth about the Holocaust, who have done your homework and read a variety of sources and opinions, this book may well push you completely over into the revisionist ("deniers") camp, as it did me.         Deborah Lipstadt is an Emory University professor of Jewish Religion, NOT history.  She was evidently supported by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in writing this book; they hold the copyright, not her.  Denying the Holocaust is an attempt to respond to Arthur Butz and others who have raised major factual objections to the usual "6 million Jews killed in gas chambers" version of WW II.         Arthur Butz gathered a wealth of research material in his book The Hoax of the Twentieth Century.  Ms Lipstadt responds to his scholarship with things such as name calling, twisted logic, half truths, appeals to emotions, failure to produce evidence, failure to define terms, omitting things, assigning bad motives, answering a question with another question, using big words, etc.  That is why I call her book, Denying the Holocaust, a Holocaust Liar's Handbook.  I value my copy as a wonderful exercise book for seeing through sophistocated lies.        
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 There are only three short films on this DVD. The Wooden Clogs With The Red Straps  Regeneration Last Day as a Teenager   If you like classic ghost stories/legends, the first one might be for you. Don't however, expect to be scared. These aren't even remotely creepy. A man stays with a family and meets their reclusive daughter with a limp. She is mysterious and warns him to stay away from the temple. The family has a secret- and there are no surprises here. Regeneration is a quick tale of a girl who can grow back body parts that are cut off. She gets married, gets dementia, again no scares and you can guess the rest. Last day as a teenager - This one is another classic ghost story about a boy who makes a deal with death- and then tries to get out of it while he tries to protect his girlfriend. 
 Our hero,amoral in his love life, refusing to kick his unfaithful ex-wife to the curb, and making mystery solving boring, why continue? Parker can write like no one else, but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry 
 this fat a** can't rap. why does this get 4 1/2 starz? i have no idea. and if u think that she is a true rapper, then just watch one of her awful movies. sellout? whatev, dont buy this, spend some dough on one of the following: 50 cent- the massacre ja rule- r.u.l.e. any cd by lil jon he is great with beats and a truly great lyricis 
 I have always enjoyed movies that have to do with life on the street and anything that deals with the hispanic culture. I usually cant stop a watching a movie until its over,once it starts it will finish. It took five minutes while watching this movie to decide to turn it off,and it wasnt a hard desicion. It looks like a low budget film with poor actors. It looks like they are not even trying. I love movies and this has to be the worst one I have ever seen. Sorry to be blunt but the truth hurts 
 if you can make it work or if you are lucky to get a non defective unit:  it can only read 1 card at a time needs specific usb power requirements (needs the usb power be +5v and not +5vsb) else you will get "USB hub power exceeded errors" the worst part is that the mainboard i tested is +5v... and still didn't work the cards inserted on the lower card slots have to be inserted upside down from time to time you can get the message usb device not recognized...  contacted support... service there = average/not so good (support forum has several topics complaining about this product)  couldn't get a replacement since 30 days tigerdirect warranty have expired, can't send the unit to ultra because currently I'm outside the US and as i stated customer service is not good.   bottom line  don't buy this item   
 Men can be so stupid and Warren is on the top of my lists. Yes he's attracted to Amy but tries to show that he is not intrested over and over again. He gives her no lasting promises, no sweet words and what does Amy do well she takes it all in stride. Yes she is a better woman than me. Amy proves to Warren over and over how much she cares for him, at some points she literally throws herself at him and after a while it got alittle tedious. What is a woman to do! Warren eventually learns to care about her and when they do sleep together Amy does not act like the virginal miss. But when these two are found in a compromising situation Warren fails me again. Get over your hang up over the woman who did you wrong in the past. And again at the end of our book poor sweet Amy is again forced to grovel for some spare crumbs from her love, yes he comes through but so disapointing. I liked my H/H to have a deeper conection with one another. I hate when the two main characters have to grovel for some sort of affection. 
 Reading all the gushing positive reviews, I'm sitting here scratching my head, wondering whether they're perhaps listening to a different CD than what I have.  When I first put on this album, it sounded fairly exciting.  With the beefy blues riffs and funky beats, I thought I was in for a good time.  But the truth is, once you hear the first ten seconds of any track, you've heard it all.  This isn't minimalism, it's just simplicity.  There's little variety, no depth, and when you hear the initial phrase of any given track repeat for the nth time, you can't help but wonder - what's the point?  I have to give credit to Lyrics Born though - the two tracks that he raps on are hands down the best, though even they follow the rinse/repeat formula.  It's too bad that his flows couldn't save the entire album.  Two stars for the two LB tracks 
 I think this book is very repetitive and is a very poor attempt at showing why losing all of these languages is important.  They are comparing losing these languages to animals and plants going extinct.  They try and draw all of these worthless comparissions that do not make any sense.  This book is not even worth being picked up

 Yes, Jordan writes well, uses words and descriptions beautifully. One of the many glowing blurbs on the dust jacket described it as "elegiac" and it certainly is, but elegiac only takes a book so far.  Beyond that, you need interesting characters that the reader cares about, set in a story that moves with a compelling narrative.  Perfect example, ATONEMENT.  Sadly, SHADE joins the pile of books I put down after wading through more than 100 pages. I could not finish it even though I was trapped on a long airplane flight with nothing else to read 
 I did not enjoy this movie very much. After reading what this movie was about, I really had high hopes for it. I expected it to be very interesting and moving. But after watching it, I was somewhat disappointed. One of the  flaws of this movie is that it focuses too heavily on the friendship  between the main character and the little girl (the main child character).  She becomes obsessed with him and develops a crush on him. She gets jealous  and possessive when he tries to help or be with others, whether they be  children or adults. I certainly did not like the part where the man had  another innocent child take her place in the transport to the death camp.  In addition, I strongly suspect that her voice was dubbed with a woman's  voice. It did not sound like a little girl's voice at all. Another of this  movie's flaws is that the play at the end of the movie, where the main  character and the children try to show the Red Cross what is really  happening  to the Jews of Europe, was, in my opinion, not very well done.  The children were pushed into a space that was supposed to represent a gas  chamber, and then they were quickly pulled out. The main character, knowing  that he and the children were going to be killed anyway, should have  concluded the play by having the children lie down and pretend to  "sleep." This would have sent a less ambiguous message to the red  cross. Overall, despite these weaknesses (and several others), I found the  movie to be passable, and am not discouraging anyone from watching it.  However, I will certainly not add it to my collection of Holocaust movies.  Some Holocaust movies that I feel are much better, and would strongly  recommend, include Schindler's List, Sophie's Choice, Europa, Europa,  Escape from Sobibor, Good Evening Mr. Wallenberg, Life is Beautiful, and  Triumph of the Spirit (the latter two movies being among the best movies I  have ever seen) 
 This item was not at all what is seems to be.  The box was the only durable part of the toy.  I unfortuantely purchased 3 of these as Christmas gifts for 3 different boys ages 5 & 6 years old.  After seeing them open and what was in the box, I was very disappointed 
 I am in eleventh grade Advanced Placement (AP) English and this is the first book I have ever read that has made me want to learn another language. This writer has no respect for his readers with his continously confusing run-on sentences and distracting word placement. Furthermore, he has no respect for the "laws" of the language, that are put there to keep from this very disgrace of a novel of ever happening. I will never read another William Faulkner novel; for this one has made me feel like my intelligence has been stripped from me. In plain, American, understandable English: THIS BOOK STINKS 
 If it's not already obvious, Monster Cable is the carpetbagger of the home entertainment world. With the rapid development of new HD and audio technology, Monster Cable does their best to be the first to provide cables--but not without charging a horrendously inflated premium. In this case, all you're getting for your 20 bucks is an RCA-to-1/8" converter and eight feet in between. Sony makes a great 5-foot cable for less than four dollars, and if the length is what you really need, you can daisychain a couple of those together for still less than half of the price of Monster Cable's offering. It is important to be aware than in the world of electronics, and in fact everywhere, someone will try to rip you off 
 Ok DVD, but not much of the younger, better James Brown 
 I can't help but wonder where the proceeds of this book are going. Does this book help any of the 17 victims of dahmer or just line the pockets of a man who claims to be a man of God? This is simply another book of a long list of others where the author is exploiting his relatively brief contact with dahmer. While Ratcliff spares the reader the most gruesome details of dahmer's crimes it none-the-less adds insult to injury that Ratcliff is profiteering from the pain and misery of this monsters victims. One needs to remember that without these 17 victims Ratcliff has no book. So, again I ask, how is this book helping the victims of dahmers evil acts? While dahmer MAY be saved, and the very thought disgusts me personally, it is Ratcliff himself that needs to do some real soul searching on his motives for writing this perverse "book" and seek repentence for himself when he realizes he is nothing more than a profiteer 
 The "Pie Every Day" idea is great in concept, but the results of these recipes leave much to be desired.  After I had tried two recipes and didn't like them, I passed the book on.  That person tried a recipe, and didn't like it.  I passed it on to yet another person, and they've tried two recipes and haven't liked them.  For someone who has pies very rarely, these recipes may be a revelation, but for accomplished cooks and for pie-savvy diners, I cannot recommend the book. The best result we've achieved thus far falls into the "not very tasty" category, others are just plain awful.  This is definitely one of those cookbooks that looks great on the shelf, reads great on the cover, but fails the test of the palate where it counts 
 This book has glaring errors in the chapter regarding Dr. Gary Kildall and CP/M.  The author trashes DOS as a "slapdash clone" and a "rip-off" of CP/M, which is simply untrue.  Tim Paterson, the author of DOS, is in fact suing the publisher and the author over numerous misrepresentations in the book.  Save your money and get a book that is better researched 
 Once again, Carr's central truth is: To know how the addiction works is to be free of it.   Unfortunately this is simply a false dawn.  The greater the need for a solution, the more willingly we suspend disbelief and trust in a system that promises an end to our problem.  This is not to say the book contains nothing of worth. But Carr's demand for total deference and his insistence on offering a complete cure inevitably prepare us for eventual disappointment. We are all more intelligent than we are capable and awareness of the insanity of addiction never saved anyone from the disease. 
 In American cinema history this is perhaps the worst waste of talent ever to hit the screen.The cast is overwhelmingly robust. However, the story, screenplay, direction,casting and effects are truely laughable. This is a huge film that doesnt even make a whimper. I encourage people to see it as a tribute to how bad a film can be made despite a wonderfully talented cast. I just sat and watched with my mouth open in shock 
 In theory, this is an excellent Cher compilation. The cover is lovely (and the first from Universal's 'Gold' series to deviate from their uniform aesthetic) and the tracklisting is a satisfactory overview of Cher's career. It certainly tops the domestic release of 'The Very Best of Cher' which was a skin-and-bones effort intended to offer the essential Cher songs and little else. Australia, Canada and parts of Europe, however, ended up with a far more interesting 2CD package. With a CD-busting length of 42 tracks, this deluxe release of 'The Very Best of Cher' leaves 'Gold' for dead. Although the two vary slightly on the earlier inclusions (you won't find Cher's brash reading of 'Alfie' on 'The Very Best of Cher', nor the iconic 'You Better Sit Down Kids' and 'Living In A House Divided) every song on 'Gold' appears on 'The Very Best of Cher' along with a healthy smattering of oft-forgotten cuts. Neither compilation addresses Cher's Warner albums from the mid-seventies, a shame considering 'Stars' and 'I'd Rather Believe In You' contain some of her best ever recordings, but at least 'The Very Best of Cher' makes more of an attempt to bridge the gap. 'Rudy' from 1982's 'I Paralyze' is a welcome inclusion, as is her otherwise unavailable on a Cher album disco cut 'Bad Love'. The Meat Loaf duet 'Dead Ringer For Love', a staple of Cher's hilarious/fabulous eighties schlock rock period, is also included, as is a cut from Cher's 1994 'not.com.mercial' CD which was sold exclusively through her website a few years back. There are also five songs from Cher's latest studio release 'Living Proof' which might seem slightly excessive, but the songs are frighteningly fun so the decision is justified.  Although the un-chronological sequencing on 'The Very Best of Cher' is rather frustrating - in that respect, 'Gold' is a more effective compilation - on content alone there is no contest. For the casual fan, the 2CD 'The Very Best of Cher' will be the only Cher album they ever need to own. For hardcores, it remains the most satisfying compilation and even offers a couple of rarities that make it a worthy purchase. Had Universal included a couple of unavailable tracks from Cher's mid-seventies period it would have scored extra brownie points, but as it stands 'Gold' is a fairly redundant release for the Cher connossieur and casual fans alike. The 2CD import version of 'The Very Best of Cher' is available here at Amazon. It may be twice the price but it is a far better investment 
 The manual helped my husband in writing his reports in the APA format. The only thing he recommends is that there should be more examples in the book. At times, he has to search for the items that were not clear in the internet 
 I found the dvd boring. The visuals were the same kaleidoscope over and over. The title of the dvd has nothing to do with the content.I didn't find any exotic robotics in it. This dvd you will view once then put it away. Actually you may not want to watch it even once. I don't recommend purchasing this unless you are a hardcore trance listener. The trance music is ok but the visuals are hard to watch after a few minutes 
 Being an avid enthusiast of the drum n' bass "scene," as pretentious as it occasionally sometimes is, in listening to this Cd I feel this is not a strong representation of the genre. This could very well be  personal, (so you headz chill) but this type of jazzy, tech-step like, a  cappella jam seems occasionally cheesy and filled  with..well..."filler."  I realize that during 1998 this was where  it was at for Grooverider. He was hardly setting off bombs in the d n b  fabric with other producers overshadowing his less-than-fresh efforts.   This album has a few choice cuts, and his production skills are  commendable, but combining so-called jazz harmonies with this type of genre  is definately an abuse of power.  The loungy progressions are worn thick,  and lacking any true creativity deep down.  This album comes nowhere near  stuff on the "Prototype Years" ep which was showcasing the fine  talents of heavy hitters Dillinja, Ed Rush, Fierce, Lemon D, Optical, and  Boymerang, to name a few.  It goes without saying that Grooverider has been  one of the most respected and talented DJ's, probably getting all of these  afforementioned producers their starts.  A big name gets alot of support   and can get away unscathed by negativity due to that stardom.  No one would  dare defy that Grooverider's attempt at making d n b is off key, but let's  not give in to someone's production skills because they are graciously  empowered in the scene like a king.  Purveyor's of fine drum n' bass can  find sanctuary elsewhere.  Stick with your records for the best 
 I bought this book because it seemed funny and what I needed to bring my spirit up.  It ended bringing me down even more!  When you read it, it looks like a someone trying to get even at all those people that havent had this problem.  It gives unworthy advise that only help you feel resented.  For example, it says that if a friend of yours tells you she is pregnant what you should do is tell her that you had noticed that she was fat and had chubby ankles!  I really do not recommend it 
 I have enjoyed reading true crime for some time now including Whoever Fights Monsters, But this book is self serving and does not introduce any new information you have not already read.  It seems Mr. Ressler is angry at John Douglas and others for not aknowledging his effort while an active profiler and he is trying to show them he was first or best or something.  The message was lost on me.  The interviews are something to read however the bulk of the book is simply a retread of his previous works.  My advice.  Skip it 
 In the begining of this book its was adventursum and kept you on the edge of your seat but I started to get board around the middle and had to put it down. The story line of this story was interesting and exciting in a  mysterious sort of way but really isnt worth reading. If I were you I would  skip the reading of this boo 
 I had to read this edition for my World Literature course and I was happy with the price (can't beat it!) and happy with the fact that it is free of scholarly interpretations, which can color the reader's opinions and/or perceptions.  It also leaves the reader to come to their own conclusions.  But one can entirely misinterpret the Buddha's teachings, especially if you've never read a single Buddhist text (like myself) and that's why I'm not too keen on this edition.    The Dover Thrift Editions, to me, are meant to whet the appetite for more in-depth writings about a particular book.  Sometimes it *does* help to have a scholar's insight - whether that person's take on the subject threatens to color your reading experience or not 
 The author had a great idea for a book.  He collected enough 'meat' for about 30-50 pages and then exploded it into almost 500 pages of boring talk, so typical of many historians.    There are a few gems in this book and those few who manage to persevere through the boredom of the text may find it somewhat rewarding.  Had the author written a 50-page book that covers the essence of what he has to offer, this would have been a four or five star book.    
 I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about investment products OTHER than common stocks. Instead, (in the book on tape), I got 5-10 minutes about the different types of bonds, a little detail about T-bills, and the frank admission that this book "doesn't really discuss corporate bonds". WHAT!? The whole rest of it is spent preparing you to run for cover for the upcoming crash of 2000 - for that, I must say he was prescient (Too bad I didn't read this in 1999!). More time is spent describing the basics of common stocks, and how the major industrial averages are calculated than is spent on bonds! Oh - and that WRONG formula for computing the price/sales ratio erroniously also made it onto the cassette version. I actually had to rewind the tape to see if I had heard correctly 
 If you like nurture arguments more than nature, read this book. He actually uses sociopath and psychopath meaning one who is socialized into becoming a psychopath versus one who is born. I don't agree with it, nor do the foremost experts on the subject. If you enjoy sociobiological explanations for rape and murder and psychopathy, then it's probably for you. For those of you who think, however, read Without Conscience by Hare, he is a foremost expert on the subject and doesn't meander through an essay on why he thinks people are psychopaths, but gives portraits of psychopathy and doesn't shy away from the fact that much of antisocial disorder and psychopathy occurs randomly. This is NOT a good book. It's full of irrelevant information and just plain wrong conclusions 
 This book was not to my liking in the least.  It completely misses many words and phrases that I recall were very essential to the alternative life style vocabulary of the sixties and seventies.  At best, it's a "desk-top" dictionary for nouveau hippie wantabes 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 The title of this book is misleading to say the least! Regarding the history, well traditional chinese martial arts history is confusing and this is just adding to that confusion. The book lists no biography or sources for that matter. I would not recommend this book to anyone, you are simply wasting your money. It glosses over basics, for example in Xing Yi Quan the author does not even mention, let alone explain the basic stance.The applications and photos are laughable. This book is geared and catered to westerners who know nothing and have no real understanding of real traditional chinese martial arts. I cannot agree with the other reviewers. I live in Beijing and have been studying Baguazhang, this book is not worth the paper it is printed on. If you want to know about real traditional chinese martial arts then you really do have to come to China 
 The original Halloween was the greatest horror movie of all time. Since then, a series of inferior sequels were released one after the other. Some were watchable such as Halloween 4. And one was actually pretty good; Halloween H20. But most were terrible drivel. Halloween 2 was a let down, Halloween 3 was an abomination, Halloween 5 was a crime against nature, and Halloween 6 (The Curse of Michael Meyers) was perhaps the worst movie ever made. Then Halloween H20 came out and surprised everybody. It was good! Could this be a trend to revive the dying franchise? Unfortunatly, the answer is no because "H2o" was followed with "Resurrection" which effectively sank the franchise back into the depths of its own miserable oblivian 
 A story told first time can be fasicnating. As Rocket Boys was. The same story told second time is just boring. The first one had a backbone: boys trying to achieve the goal despite the circumstances. The second one - ranomly selected stories about this or that - I simply don't care. Meaningless and borin 
 This is the kind of information my therapist of 4 years spewed...then I found one who offered practical guidework and here I am...a healed child. 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 Hope Edelman's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study. She has chosen a narrow scope for her research, and that's fine--that is, until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics (such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them. The second hole in Edelman's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones--where the basis for this statement? I'll believe it when I see it. It's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships; what's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just don't matter as much. Within the context of her thesis, they are not as significant, but this is something that Edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she didn't write about them because they are not as significant. Other than these two crucial holes, Edelman's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family, both from her own life and from her case studies. It's worth a read, not so much for its actual insights, but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own 
 Lover's Lane....another no brainer slasher movie straight to video and its really horrible. Lover's Lane is the hot spot to where you wanna go to make out but 15 years ago some people were murdered up at that joint and 15 years later, some relatives of the people who were murdered up there (always is) Are tormented in the present but the "Hook Man" from the Urban Legend. Pretty much a snoozer with bad acting (who calls this acting good?). How many screaming teenaged girls have we seen in movies? It only works if the movie is good and this is not a good movie. The plot twists and turns arent even that great....idiotic writing. Starring: Riley Smith (Radio, 8 Legged Freaks), Erin J. Dean (Lolita, A Pig's Tale), Suzanne Bouchard (Joyful Partaking), Sarah Lancaster (Four Kings, Dr. Vegas), Diedre Kilgore (Good Luck, The Falls), Billy O'Sullivan (A Change Of Heart, Rites), Matt Reidy (Hit and Run, Carried Away) and Anna Faris (Scary Movie 1-4, Just Friends) in one of her earlier movies. Nothing can save this from being thrown over a cliff....it's ridiculous 
 I was tempted to toss this book into the trash after reading the first two paragraphs that pronounced God dead and the character Anna master, oh, excuse me, mistress of the earth.  But then I begin to wonder just what kind of point was this author trying to make. I forced myself to trudge forward with the novel and found the story line and characters quite novel.  But too many times shivers ran down my back as the author pronounced, through the heroine, Anna, her hatred of people, especially those who believe in God.  How can anyone who cares so much for plants and animals wish for "an Old Testament God to visit the peak with one of His famous scourges: a lightning storm that would blast the rock clean of cloying humanity".. 
 I'll agree with other reviewers that the content doesn't provide much supplemental information, but I confess a preference for hard copy documentation when I'm using software. It's the booklover in me, plus the fact that I like to look at the manual and the game I'm playing at the same time.  My complaint with this book is that it is cheaply produced and difficult to read. I've grown used to the 4-color Prima guides. They are excelently laid out and easy on the eye. The Civ IV guide, however, is B&W and the font size is 9 at best. Unless you have great vision, you'll find yorself wanting to use a magnifier. It's fascinating. The Prima Sims2 Nightlife manual has 224 pages, all 4-color, and is a pleasure to read. The Brady Civ IV manual has 188 B&W pages and is a complete pain to peruse. Both have list prices of $19.99. One guess which company is delivering the best value 
 Love Cathe but this one is just not for me. The complex step choreography left me extremely frustrated -- I spent half the time just watching the TV screen, completely lost! And Cathe was cuing AS she does the moves, which didn't help. I simply couldn't keep up. Give me a straightforward, athletic workout where I don't have to learn a whole lot of fancy footwork, and I'm happy.  That being said, if you're experienced with step workouts or you're very coordinated, then this might be for you. It looks intense & challenging. Beginners and people with two left feet: keep looking 
 I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent.  This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading.  The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful.  I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed.  I ask you  how many women do you know that use a term like "skirt hound" for a man who chases women?  I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me!  It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue.  Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one 
        This book was tiresome reading at times, with many mathematical tables of which were put in the book to provide an alibi for whomever might disagree with the man and how he came to the conclusions he had done. I must agree with one of the reviwers of this book --- " Who cares?". I mean ultimately, it will be the readers themselves that will judge what exactly was the greatest and productive findings in history.   The Techonologically inclined will say that Science is the master of all that is and the more liberal arts type will insist that the Arts is what defines a culture. The fact is that both do because both hold a sea-saw effect, without imagination there is no science and without science there is no reason for a human being to think beyond what reality tells him to be so. It is science that produces better paints, better materials that lets the Artist craft and produce --- so why pit them against eachother?    It is that point that I will give this particular book 2 stars, as well as the way it was made. The side notes in a terrible headache making Blue with white type was a horrible idea. The reading was very drawn out and I've read better on far more drier  material.  The fact the guy took a good few years of his life to do this seems kind of odd, and I question it --- one should wonder, why? Somone could have made the arguement that the West had a far more promenint mark on the world in far fewer pages and time then this particular author has done. 
 I had trouble with installing the firewire port. I did not get any help with the company. 
 Amazon's review reads: Bening delivers an acclaimed performance that gives the film a dramatic weight it otherwise lacks. The rest is for anyone who enjoys a laugh at the freak-show expense of damaged and damaging characters.   Well, not so fast . . . Bening is such an unsympathetic, one-demensional, self-absorbed, manipulative, moron that it is impossible to relate to her on any level, thus leaving us numb to both her character and Bening's acting.   Honestly, any mature actress could have played this part and in the same manner; therefore, I'm not so keen on this notion that Bening gives an "acclaimed performance" here.  As for the rest of this film, I could not find a single "laugh at the freak-show of damaged characters."  There is NO ONE to connect with in this terrible story of self-absorbed and self-destructive characters and that is at the heart of this heartless film.  There is no one to love and/or cheer for.  NOT ONE.  Of this 2 hour and 10 minute film, I felt so drained and disgusted by the end of the first hour that I had to shut it off.  Now I know someone is going to say, "Hey, Steve, you should have given it a chance" or "if you would have watched the whole film you would have seen . . ."  Hey, listen, if I have to sit through 1-2 hours of hateful characters that I can't stomach and plot that just difts like dead wood on a calm lake to get to some clever ending or witness a sudden awakening by the major character, then it wasn't worth my attention.  A good ending or a good final third or fourth of a film does not save it or give it any credibility.  But that's just me . . .  I have seen my share of dysfunctional family films and they were infinitely better.  "Little Miss Sunshine" comes to mind.  There are a number of annoying, destructive, and disgusting characters in that film, but there was love too and a storyline that went somewhere and was meaningful.  "Scissors" by the end of the first hour went nowhere, had not one character one could relate to or cheer on, and the characters where all so self-absorbed that love was nothing more than a four-letter-word in this film.  This was an abuse to the senses.  Sorry, these kinds of films are just not in my taste.  Contrary to Amazon's review, I found nothing humorous in this exercise in "poking fun at dysfunctional families" as one person put it.  In fact, I found simply nothing in this film worthy of my attention or yours 
 I think that this is a classic example of the problems with alternative punishments.  Not that I wouldn't like to see vast improvements in how we handle prisoners, but this is a prize example of the arrogance of untested theory.   With the vague half-vast planning that attends so many vast ideas, Menninger pompously assured us that "men of science" would solve all our problems.   The statistics that I have read don't bear this out.   Psychologist are USUALLY wrong in predicting whether or not a released prisoner will later become violent.  It almost seemed a little cruel reading this book.   Menninger praises indeterminate sentencing at our Patuxent Institute here in Maryland as the shining light beckoning to the future proper criminal justice.   Crime was a social sickness, and should be handled by doctors, who would know when people could be released.   In the mid-70s, the same people who had mouthed these sentiments were denouncing Patuxent as cruel, indeterminate sentences as monstrous.   I may not have the figures for the prize case absolutely correct, but in the ballpark, a man had spent 19 years in Patuxent for an auto theft; he would have served about 18 months in prison.  Apparently, the good doctors are competent to release someone, but not to hold them.  The aforementioned man, after all, wasn't supposed to be undergoing punishment but treatment.   Supposedly, he was suffering from a disease as real as any physical ailment and his anti-social behavior arose from a real inability to control his own behavior.   Stealing the car was merely a symptom of this illness, not evidence of its severity.  If we are supposed to believe that psychprofessionals can tell us that it is safe to release someone, they should be able to tell us when it is not, and we should therefore believe that the above-mentioned prisoner was not yet fit to be released and presumably would have committed more crimes and been re-arrested.  But, indeterminant sentencing was modifed so that no-one could be held at Patuxent longer then they would have been held in prison, so the Institute began to specialize in particularly grim crimes, usually exceptionally ghastly murders.   Concerns about the goal of returning these people to society caused an embattled administrator to complain because people wanted Patuxent to deal with people guilt of lesser crimes (like car theft?).  She complained that such were often more difficult to treat than the extremely violent.  So there we have it - if treating people as mentally ill has no better result than treating them as willfully irresponsible, shouldn't we simply go for the cheaper system?  Or are we simply to accept criminal behavior as the just punishment of us as a society for failing to meet to social needs, effectively abolishing the idea of crime and take no coercive steps to control it?  Are we really sure that we have only to choose to take better care of our citizens to ensure that no-one will be traumatized into antisocial behavior?  In all situations, I believe that it is a given that we could do better, indeed standards of what constitute an adequate job are always changing, but will it really eliminate all our problems?  The problem is that people cannot seem to make up their minds whether most people should be held accountable for their actions or not.   The present system assumes that in most cases they can, and that punishment is intended to make them decide that the possibilities of the crime aren't worth the risk of prison.   "Crime as a disease" assume that they cannot be held accountable, but most people still want to retain legal structures and protections intended for the former case - a real dog's dinner of a system.  Maybe one day, crime can really be handled in a rational way, based upon meaningful research.   For now, it seems to remain a clash of egos and insufficiently supported philosophies 
 The pajamas are way to long.  They look like they were made for someone 7 feet tall 
 This guy is a psycho-boomer looney.  His book serves best as kindling 
 I have never read a Danielle Steel novel, but my friend bought it when we were inter-railing through Europe last week so I picked it up out of sheer boredom.   The grammar is atrocious, and the repetitiveness highly irritating. How many times do Sasha and what's his name need to break up and get back together? How often does Sasha need to cry about this artsy guy?   This book was so annoying that I had to literally put it down and stop reading it.  I will never pick up another Danielle Steel book, and I am still appalled that the publishing world even let this one be published! 
   Intelligent persons like Kauffman are close to accept Nietzsche's     believes, but the religious need, blind their minds 
 Having first seen this film at university twenty years ago I was really looking forward to watching this scary but masterful political propaganda film once again but my copy was a dud. About 70 minutes into the film it started to get the wobblies. The images became broken up and pixelated and then the image froze altogether whilst the sound continued. Then the sound froze. I had to keep fast forwarding to get through the glitches. QA could not have been to rigorous. The digital reproduction on the DVD is poor at this point and this continues throughout the whole of the SS review.  I'll be asking for my money back. 
 I purchased this book as part of a required reading for my high school honors geometry course. It is perhaps the most utterly boring and fanatical piece of fiction I have ever read. Not only is the book completely devoid of plot, it is lacking in all aspects of what a true work of fiction should include. This book has not educated me further on geometric concepts, nor has it enlightened me of any time period of which this book is said to be mirroring. Instead, it has wasted my time, which is precious to me now, and has completely confused me. Do not purchase this book. Do not assign it as required reading and most definitely do not read it for pleasure. There are other 80 page books that you can spend your time on.  Read anything else before you read Flatland 
 Don't be misled.  Because Thomas Berry is promoted as a Catholic priest, many people are falsely led to believe that his books present Catholic or Christian teaching about the environment.  Instead, this book presents a New Age blend of do-it-yourself religion mixed with pseudo-science.  If you're into that, you'll probably like this book.. 
 God these poesurs couldn't be anyworse. Whats funny is that travis barker is getting a divorce!! He sucks!! 
 This is one of those books where all the best parts can be found on the book jacket!  I was intrigued by the book jacket description of the Swap Shop Show:  "If you've got something you're itching to sell, something  you mighta never woulda bought no way, then give us a call," but this  idea isn't expanded upon in the text.  Instead, this seems to be another in  a series of recent books where the authors seem to believe a series of  quirky characters alone a great novel make.  Not so.  Readers want  characters they can get to know, characters who grow and change throughout  the book, not a series of semi-related vignettes about cardboard cutouts of  people.  I particularly found McCorkle unable to handle the parallel story  lines well.  Perhaps the plot ties together in the end (I just couldn't get  that far, I really tried!), but the impression I got was of jerking back  and forth between stories that may have stood better on their own.  For  examples of successful books employing the parallel-lives technique, see  Tom Wolfe's *A Man in Full* or Michelle Huneven's *Round Rock.*  I've  gathered in reading reviews that McCorkle is being hailed as a great new  Southern author; I found no Southern flavor at all in this book.  These  silly characters could have lived anywhere.  I guess I'll stick to Rita Mae  Brown when I want a taste of the South 
 been using the product for 6 months now - battery time isnt great - I constantly need to recharge the battery.  People always complain of an echo 
 I really can't stand this play. We're supposed to feel sorry for selfish, ridiculous Barney, who says he loves his wife, yet is trying to have a one-afternoon stand in his mother's apartment, and with the most awful women. I actually felt sorry for the women, although I don't think that was Neil Simon's intention. I really don't care about Barney and his midlife crisis. Did he ever think that every single person on this earth who has time to think about it worries about their own mortality and not accomplishing anything in the time they have on the planet. But they don't consider a tacky 2-hour sexfest to be the accomplishment of a lifetime! At least I HOPE not. Never once does Barney consider anything but his need for a little pathetic excuse for excitement. What about his poor wife? What was supposed to happen to the woman he thinks is so wonderful if she finds out he was making it with her best friend? It's disgusting, Barney is a horrible character, and I can't believe this play worked for anybody even in the 1970's. The female characters are stereotypes, not real people (maneating Mrs. Robinson, flaky hippy chick and depressed Jewish lady). They're right out of "Love, American Style" except that was less bitter and funnier 
 Sorry, but I really hated this pretentious, boring, and useless exercise in academic masturbation. It's all just an excuse for the writer to drone on and on about her favorite books. A lackluster lesson in literary snobbery, this lifeless thesis paper includes iffy interpretations of dry excerpts, unhelpful writing hints, and zero sense of humor or drama. If you don't love the same books, stories, and writers that Francine Prose loves, you're pretty much screwed. As a published writer myself, I often check out writing books for inspiration. This is one of the worst. I prefer something lighter, more engaging and motivational to light a fire under me. I like Ray Bradbury's book, with its infectious boyish enthusiasm, and the terrific book about publishing, "The Forrest for the Trees" (the first half is inspiring, but the second half a little depressing.) Either way, skip this yawn-fest 
 Ordered two frames from the third party source.  Neither on of them worked at all.  It has been a nightmare trying to return them for a refund 
 This book was not enlighting, alot of the information was out date. The phone numbers to the locations were disconected etc 
 The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because I love Benefit. That being said, this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper. It's so faint that you can hardly smell it, but when you do, it's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better. If you are looking for a young, fun perfume, stay away from this one. It smells old and drab, like your grandmother's china cabinet or an antique store. But if you like that.. 
 This was most likely a failed attempt at selling some more copies. Being a student of history myself I understand the "truth" that historians do not know exactly what happened in the past. They do, however, attempt to reconstruct the events in the past and offer some explanation as to why they happened and how they affect us today.  Schama does none of the above. Without any footnotes or sources to go by one cannot trace Scahma's logic and reasoning. Nor can one draw their own conclusions from the documents Schama uses because they simply aren't there. By this I mean he adds a note at the end saying, more or less, "screw you" to anyone that wants to follow his work.  If one is looking for a good read on the French and Indian War checkout Fowler's "Empires at War". In the end Schama's book is perfectly titled "Unwarranted Speculations" indeed 
 Being in the asset management consulting field I thought this highly recommended title should be as insightful as Swensen's "Pioneering Portfolio Management". I found it directionless, full of unconnected pointless anecdotal comments, as well as giving misleading shallow guidance regarding indexing 
 If anyone has ever done any research into the fields of congnitive psychology or memory, you'll realize how incredibly awful this book is.   "If you are unable to remember any specific instances [of abuse] like the ones mentioned above but still have a feeling that something abusive happened to you, it probably did." Page 21. How awful is that? Completely misleading as well. Any memory such as this can be implanted into someone's mind, when they had NO actual abuse in their lives.  Furthermore, "If you think you were abused and your life shows the symptoms, then you were." Page 22. Need I say more? This is utter trash. Completely unbased by scientific findings or even common sense.  Avoid this book at all costs if you are a serious victim of child abuse. Realize that it is very easy, as humans, to recall past instances of violence, trauma, and abuse, when they actually NEVER happened.   It's sad and morally disturbing to see a book such as this in print. It's even more disturbing that people are accepting this book as a true "self-help" book. I encourage ANYONE thinking about buying this to reconsider and do a lot more research into their past before conjuring up false recall of past memories 
 I'm sorry, but I find his vision of America implausible.  I suppose the United States could turn into a third-world fascist country in the next ?20? years, but I'd need more explanation or back-story before I could willingly suspend my disbelief.  That would be enough for a 2-star or 3-star review.  What, frankly, offended me about the book was the psychopath in uniform and the Homeland Security monsters.  I'm a veteran, I know other veterans, I know people in the service right now, I know people who've been to Iraq and Afghanistan.  The psycho and the "Homesecs" are an insult to our troops.  The afterword says the book was inspired by the events of 9/11.  I'm afraid my sympathies are with the people risking everything to keep more innocents from being blown up by terrorists.  I was really looking forward to this book.  I have almost everything Varley's written, and have never given anything less than 4 stars, and usually 5.  But not this time.  An immense disappointment. :(  If you liked this book, I hope my review doesn't offend you.  Maybe I took it too personally.  I just want to warn others who might react as I did.  I wish I hadn't bought this 
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 There are several discrepancies in this book, starting with the title.  The top job is an air traffic controller, making approx. $120K a year.  Here's the problem:  To become an air traffic controller, a person must enroll in an FAA-approved education program and pass a pre-employment test that measures his or her ability to learn the controller's duties. Exceptions are air traffic controllers with prior experience and military veterans. The pre-employment test is currently offered only to students in the FAA Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative Program or the Minneapolis Community & Technical College, Air Traffic Control Training Program. The test is administered by computer and takes about 8 hours to complete. To take the test, an applicant must apply under an open advertisement for air traffic control positions and be chosen to take the examination. When there are many more applicants than available positions, applicants are selected to take the test through random selection. In addition to the pre-employment test, applicants must have 3 years of full-time work experience, have completed a full 4 years of college, or a combination of both. In combining education and experience, 1 year of undergraduate study--30 semester or 45 quarter hours--is equivalent to 9 months of work experience. Certain kinds of aviation experience also may be substituted for these requirements. That to me says I need a degree!  Several other jobs listed in the book are also "mis-informing".  
 I received this book as a gift, and found it unreadable. For example, EFS says cost/benefit analysis "is a procedure by which the higher is reduced to the level of the lower and the priceless is given a price". This is meaningless rhetoric to me. It also assumes that only economics provides a guide to human behavior. Or that all economic analysis is totally rational. Schumacher questioned every assumption of "economic science" using theories from the anarchist tradition. Schumacher claimed neocolonialism is the result of politics, not economic principles. But doesn't class and sectional interests drive politics? His advocacy of a search for inward spiritual space, and a rejection of the real world of politics and economics, makes this book part of the problem and not part of the solution.  The 'Introduction' says Gandhi wanted to use "labor-intensive manufacture and handicrafts" (p.5). Milovan Djilas said it was important for newly liberated countries to use mass production ("The New Class"). The historical record over the past centuries should tell you who was right or wrong. Liberating revolutions result in more production and other benefits for the people; else they're not liberating. Unlimited economic growth overlooks the availability of basic resources and the capacity of the environment. But there's always some natural problem that causes a correction.  This is a very verbose book whose arguments rest on unquestioned assumptions. Since it was published in 1973 Thatcher's regime destroyed Britain's coal industry to make them dependent on imported oil and gas. We've seen what happened after they divided and privatized the railroads. But who benefited from these political decisions?   Part II Chapter 3 notes that western Europe "deliberately destroyed nearly half of their coal industries". But the economy in neocolonialist countries will always suffer to benefit the imperialist ruling country. American was a net petroleum exporter until 1967, and influenced Saudi Arabia and Iran (just like Great Britain did previously). You can also consider the actions of Jimmy Carter against nuclear reactors. France and Japan use nuclear power, they have no oil. Saudi Arabia uses nuclear power so they can profitably sell their oil abroad. Those who criticized this book showed good judgment and wisdom. You can read this book and judge its worth for yourself. 
 Sorry guys, but after all the hype that was building up to the initial release of the Blue Lion Collection here, I am extremely disappointed about the final product here.    OK, first of all I was a big fan of this show back in '84 and '85....but that was when I was only like 10 or so.  So, weigh that in with what I have to say below.  So 20+ years later, even after restoration, the animation in this series just doesn't hold up.  From the crudely animated environment to the pencil like drawings of the lions and Voltron, to the terribly animated mouth movements, the animation is just horrible compared to the 3D enhanced animation we get today in modern animated shows like Justice League and other mainstream anime series.  Oh, one note about the restoration itself.  If this is restored, I'd hate to see what it was like prior to restoration.  It still looks pretty bad, IMO.    Another thing I find disturbing is the juvenile dialogue.  Very childish dialogue on top of very childish voice-overs.  I mean it's not even funny.  It's like the scrounged the bottom of the barrel to get these actors to voice this show.  I guess I'm just spoiled now that modern animated show get some top voice actors to give life to the characters.  I bought this collection with the intention of buying the whole set, but after struggling to get through the 15 episodes, I'm not gonna waste any more of my time or money on this badly aged series.  If I may say so myself, the packaging is the only redeeming feature of this set.  Shame the series itself isn't any better.   Now, if they were to ever release the 3D CGI animated version of Voltron, I'd buy that set in an instant.  That one was for a much mature audience.  Hopefully it'll see the light of day soon.  IIRC, it was only 26 episodes or so, so a 4 disc set would catch that one 
 How can Stephen Mitchell even think of such an abberation - editing Walt Whitman's greatest poem? Sure, there are several versions of the Song of Myself, but if you want to read Whitman, read the original. The first version is the most powerful, and Whitman toned it down over the years, turning it into "poetry" rather than his initial burst of enthusiasm. There are several editions of the poem that will let you get the true texts: for example, the Library of America's complete Whitman has both the first version of Leaves of Grass and the "deathbed" version, which Whitman revised shortly before his death. There are other versions throughout Whitman's career, as he added poems to the Leaves, and tinkered with existing poems. But this book is a sham. Avoid it 
 Simply put, Air would be my favorite band if they did strictly instrumental albums. Unfortunately they've moved away from this. I can not listen to this album the whole way through; the songs with vocals make me cringe and skip to the next tracks. "Alone in Kyoto," "Alpha Beta Gaga," and "Mike Mills" are brilliant songs, but the rest of the album is ruined by cheesy lyrics, poorly sung, and distorted not to add any ethereal quality but to mask the limited vocal ability of the duo.  
 Contrary to what it says at the top of Amazon's page for the audiotape version of this book, Bill Bradley is NOT the "reader."  Someone named John Randolph Jones is the reader.  This is a big issue for me, as I  wanted to be able to hear Bradley speak these well-worded essays on life.   Too bad HighBridge didn't get him to do that.  AND too bad Amazon.com  didn't cathch this fact and write "read by other" at the top of  the page for this product 
 with so many wonderful, creative, and clever craft project books out there, don't bother with this one. i would suggest any book by jocasta innes instead- she is a designer who is always  inovative and original 
 Berkhof's Systmatic is of course a classic text that is a gem.  I had the old Banner Of Truth edition for years but like a dope sold it for pennies on the dollar.  This edition from Eerdmans is truly abominable.    Where do I start?  First off, the font size is terrible.  So if you are over 58 the eye strain is quite significant.  Then comes the print type.  It is almost as if someone churned out copies in his garage.  The printing is extremely bad.  Sentences contain words that after a letter or two turn light and then dark and in a few instances downright smudgy.  Was the typeset dirty?  Did you run out of ink?  True, this edition contains Berkhof's introductory section which is a bonus.  But what good is it if the production quality is abysmal?  How unfortunate that such a magnificient work is so insulted.   Mr. Publisher, check out Shedd's Dogmatic Theology by P and R Publishers.  That is how one presents a text of significance.    If you have the Banner Of Truth edition do not trade it in lest you rue the day.     
 Here's the deal:  Janet Evanovich is writing for the money.  The series hit its climax at To the Nines. Ten Big Ones was a disappointment, and Eleven on Top had none of the fun its racy title promised.   The Barnaby series are manufactured pop romps (though I'll still read them), and are bound to burnout soon.   The thing is, I think Evanovich knows this. I think she understands that her writing style has become stale, trite, and disappointing. Looking for inspiration, she has turned back to her early work.  Evanovich published 10+ wonderful suspense/mystery/action/ROMANCE novels that pop up on Ebay occasionally. I've read some of them, and they really are quite fun. Even better, she is rereleasing them for the mass audiences.   Anyway, the first of these books was Full House. She repackaged this with fairly disappointing conclusions, but continued the series with (in the wrong order) Full Tilt, Full Blast, Full Speed, and now, Full Bloom.  These novels were fun, exciting, silly, and fresh. This may be because Evanovich teamed up with Charlotte Hughes. Anywhichway, with Full Bloom, Evanovich has slipped back into her old writing style: the twenty page setup, the quick burnout, and two hundred extra pages of nothing.   I ended up skimming the end part of this book, and it was still slow and painful. Try and guess the mystery by reading the summary! You probably will. Try the other Full series, and get her old romances: The Rocky Road to Romance, Love Overboard, and Back to the Bedroom 
 Daniel Pipes said about this book:  "With uncommon skill, Shlaim has managed-in the confines of a very small volume with very large margins-to pack misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense into 1994's worst book on the Middle East."  Well, is that true?  Probably.  But just to show everyone that I am not only tolerant and soft-hearted, but generous, I'll give this book not just one, but two stars!    You see, there are plenty of facts in this small book.  In addition to the misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense which it does indeed abound with.  Shlaim claims that the 1973 Yom Kippur War broke the diplomatic stalemate in the region and led to peace.  He's not the only one to have said this.  But I wouldn't consider saying something like this on a dare.  I'd be laughed out of town!   Could I say with a straight face that the way to start negotiations towards peace is to launch a war of aggression against a neighbor?  No.  And just how strong is the peace between Egypt and Israel anyway?  Not very.  It is more a cease-fire than a peace, with a constant barrage of anti-Israeli propaganda from the Egyptian side.  After that, we see Shlaim explain that land-poor Israel can have territory or peace.  Really?  I think it is more reasonable for those who want peace to permit land-poor nations to buy or keep something closer to their fair share of land.  In my opinion, Israel is more likely to have both territory and peace or neither of them than one or the other.  And the author says that Israel can have territory or American support.  Again, this could well be a false choice.  Even if Israel, for some reason, can not have both American support and territory, why ought one expect it to have American support if it does not have territory?  Shlaim sums up the problem of the Arabs versus the Jews.  Security pleases the Jews.  Fairness pleases the Arabs.  I wish this were true.  Let's see.  Fairness.  Does that mean letting everyone, including Jews and Arabs, buy land throughout the region and keep it?  Does that mean a Truth and Reconciliation session or two where the Arabs can apologize for their violence and aggression against Levantine Jews?  Sounds fair to me!  Shlaim is totally out of line to pretend that it is unfair to not steal Jewish land, or that it is unfair to allow Israel to stay on the map.  As for the Oslo peace accords, Shlaim praises them as the beginning of a new era.  Plenty of people were extremely suspicious of Oslo.  Shlaim was wrong here.  And those who were suspicious of Oslo generally had the right reasons to be suspicious.  I think that ought to make us more than a little suspicious of Shlaim.  Now, what does Shlaim recommend?  It is simple.  America is simply too much in favor of Israel!  Shlaim thinks we need a more "even-handed" approach.  And that (this was written before 9/11) America ought not "bolster Israel as a strategic partner in an unwinnable war against an imaginary Islamic threat."  Wow.  Imaginary.  But unbeatable.  Shlaim really took a strong view here.  I think 9/11 showed that we're dealing with a real, not an imaginary threat.  And in the long run, why shouldn't a war in favor of truth, justice, and human rights be winnable?  I see no reason to give up without even trying.  If you want to learn about war and peace in the Middle East, try some other book 
 I was disappointed in this CD, not too many songs in English, and not very good ones. Haven't viewed the DVD yet, so I'm hoping that there are better songs on it. Not a good buy if you're looking for another Josh Groban CD to listen to in the car 
 An interesting discussion of differing approaches by the medical and non-medical communities. The techniques espoused by Mr. Sarno didn't help my back pain, though 
 I've read 300 of the 362 pages and I can't be bothered to finish.  Not particularly well written.  The secondary characters are un-developed and annoying... in fact, the same can be said for the main characters.    I don't care what happens to them.  I don't care about finding out what the "mystery" is.  I can't figure out how they could possibly have fallen in love.  The author just springs it on you.  It's a bit insulting to the reader, in fact.    The heroine is passive and whiny... "[spies (or whatever) are following me and I'm going to do nothing about it except wait for them to spring on me at every tourist site and "ruin" the tourist experience for me.]"  This is my first book by this author, and unless I forget her name (it's a very bland, forgettable name) and accidentally buy something by her again, it is the last.  I'm really glad I only paid a buck for it 
 Good comedy should have a strong sense of reality. After all, laughter is a release of frustrations and pain that takes place in your real life. This movie just is not realistic. Ellen is great, and the film could have been good if it kept to realism. That altar scene is one example. Half way thru, I lost interest. Save your money 
 I happen to think that this book is excellent and the Dave Eggers has a wonderful style. My bad rating of this book is due to the poor condition I received it in ...What a shame 
 Full of less than half information, just do your EMT Basic license at a local community college.  Its a real qualification and you know that you met a standard.  After all, people are not legos and in an emergency you want skills you can depend on...because thats exactly what you'll be doing 
 I'm a huge Britney fan, but this cd [stunk] so bad.  When I bought it, I thought I was gettin a remix cd of songs like Lucky, Stronger, Satisfaction, and other songs on that cd, but it was just "Oops" when it came in the mail.  Two song, Track Numbers 5 and 7 are over 6 minutes, and 7 is the instrumental of 5 
 Breaking up is the catalyst that will transform the lives for four people. Lucy Miller-Materson finds that her husband, who has recently flipped out in front of their family, has made one New Year's resolution, to leave her. Her sister's life of serial monogamy's most recent break up has left Miranda with many regrets, and what if's. Miranda's new room-mate and the girl Lucy has recently hired as an assitant, Roxy, walked out of her own wedding, and Christopher, the single father competing with Lucy for a promotion, faces the challenges of being a noncustodial dad on a daily basis.   Told from each of their points of view, this story often seems very disjointed. However, the fact that each does manage to make a comeback from disaster is noteworthy. Yet, a cleaner ending without more resolution would have been appreciated.    Amanda Killgore 
 I described this novel to a friend as a mediocre novel that finally took a turn for the worse.  I kept hoping it would get better.  Each part, however, went further and further south.  Part 3, was ultimately, it's demise.  It felt like an episode of the Twilight Zone.  Not the original, engaging Twilight Zone, but the new and contrived Twilight Zone.    With all of the great literature out there, this was a waste of my time 
 I purchased this book to give as a gift to my nephew.  When it arrived, I opened the book to the middle and I could not believe what I was looking at.  One of the art scenes is of a battle where a man charging on a horse has been decapitated.  Blood is spewing from the headless neck, his necklace is falling in one direction, and his separated head (with a horror/surprise look on his face) is falling to the ground behind the horse.  This is very gruesome, and there is no way I could give this as a gift a child of any age.  Wondering what could be worse, I turned the page to find another battle scene.  One man is being struck to the back of the head with a club/mace and his head is caved by the blow.  I am not making this up, the head is split open and details are painted.  Many others in this same art work lie dead and dieing with arrows in their heads and torsos.  I look at the next artwork, and a man is pinning another to the ground while he slices his throat with a knife.  Why would someone pick these art works?  Why would the editors allow them?  I'm still stunned that this would make it print. 
 This is a fine volume of dense anthropological articles.  If the reader is hoping for something along the lines of the excellent Elizabeth Wayland Barber's works, they should look elsewhere. I don't know how it rates as anthropology, but the topics are much, much narrower than 'human experience,' confined to examination of particular ethnic and cultural custom in which cloth (widely defined) is involved 
 I was very disappointed in this book. I was hoping for recipes that appear somewhat familiar. My family would be more traumatized if I tried to feed them hearts of palm and guava nectar then 2 dinners in a row of beanie weenies. The appendix charts repeats information freely found on many disaster survivor web sites. Bottom line, instead of buying this book, use the money to add to your food storage 
 I'm sorry, but Chicken Soup for the Soul annoys me to no end.  The stories are not original-I've seen most of them in various forms in chain letters and Ann Landers and Dear Abby.  Most of them are VERY poorly written, cliched, and dumbed down.  When I'm depressed, they make me feel even WORSE.  I'd rather read a cynical, sarcastic very nasty story that makes me laugh-and realize I'm MUCH better off!   Sorry to say, but these books are nothing but dollars for the creators.  You're better off rereading childhood classics for a pick-me-up 
 If you purchase a Garmin product, especially this one, you are firmly in the clutches of a Company that gives you what they want you to have, not what you might want. Everything Garmin makes is proprietary so that nothing else will work on a Garmin. You will be unable to transfer data to Garmin media, you will be insulted by a website either written by or for aliens and should you call the customer service or cartography lines assuming you wish to wait and wait, you will get to talk to people so uninformed about Garmin products your wait was wasted. The dingus works ok with Garmin chips, but the chips are inadequate or incomplete. If you should have a Mac, Garmin leaves you totally unsupported so that if you choose a Garmin you need to buy a PC, a downloader, and Garmin chips to go with Garmin's vastly overpriced CDs. In short, if you prefer unsupported products that are designed to force you to buy from a company indifferent to their customers, Garmin should be at the top of your list with their GPSMAP 276c 
 The Evolutionists is an endlessly repetitive, poorly organized book, replete with spelling and grammatical errors.  Worse, it is an uninspired introduction to a fascinating and important topic.  Morris appears to have expended as little effort as possible researching this book, and evinces only a facile understanding of the issues he engages.  The Evolutionsists reads like a third-rate middle school book report.  It's about 5 pages of content morphed into 200+ pages of text (how many times can Morris report exactly the same findings about stickleback fish?  I lost count...).  Though not popular science writing at its worst (Morris at least comes across as a neutral reporter, and his facts are generally correct), the Evolutionists is popular science writing at its most mediocre.  What a disappointment.  Are Morris' other books this lame?           
 I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y 
 The only other author I ever read who so effectively combined self-pity and wry humor was Erica Jong. Jill Nelson turns a wicked phrase and makes her characters and her situations jump to life. I laughed aloud at her  description of her teenage daughter telling her "Mom, get a  life!" in response to her lecturing about black conciousness.   All  through the book I kept wondering where Ms. Nelson's gripes came from.  Because her dad left her mom for a white woman, as recounted in the book?  She grew up in plush surroundings, with summers on Martha's Vineyard. As  the number of unread pages shrank, I kept wondering if Ku Kluxers in white  sheets were going to suddenly show up in the book to explain her bitter  feelings about white males. Ms. Nelson said that white men are priveleged,  but believe me, we too can be put through the grinder.   I'm also a former  newspaper reporter, born the same year as Ms. Nelson. When she complained  about her reporting duries at the Washington Post, saying "I was too  old to chase fire engines," I had to laugh. That's exactly what I was  doing at another paper at the time she said that.   I don't buy what Jill  Nelson says, but I did enjoy the way she tells it 
 i saw this for a good price.  i checked for reviews.  there were all theese great reviews. whatever!  the movie has pretty  much no action.  the sound video actin is good, but its lonngg and sloowww.  there was some good nudity.  that is the only thing keepin me from totally considering this as a loss. ok movie jus dont expect action jus anticipate the nudity cause that is the only thing interesting besides the falcon in this movie. i love falcons, so there you go.  i think of it as good enough to keep thats it. maybe ill pop it in to watch a long slow movie with a girlfriend. take this as the downside review so all theese other reviews don fool you into thinking this movie is all tha 
 I am sure he is an amazing mathematician, but I found this book to be the most horrible linear book I have ever seen. The text that was bolded and italicized was inconsistent and therefore very confusing especially in a book which employs bold face to denote specific mathematical qualities. Furthermore, the conversational style and lack of fluidity had a synergy that would drive even the craziest mathematician crazier. I would reco Lay's or Pooles or Bronson's (this might be my favorite because it is proof intensive). Again, he is a better mathematician than I will ever be, even if he was wasted, but I would not reco this book to any first semester linear student, go for one of the aforementioned authors 
 I was disappointed by this "behind the scenes" book. Not at all as entertaining and delightful as the author wants you to believe. Some interesting facts nestled in a whole lot of information available from other books or Disney themselves. Borrow from the library if you absolutely have to read it yoursel 
 I love PKD.  But this book belongs at the bottom of the PKD pile.  Don't make it your first read by PKD.  Predictable, underdeveloped, ludicrous, and tedious, without the usual PKD reality or thinking challenges.  Sadly, the best character is the slime mold 
 We were really excited about this item, but have been very disappointed.  We followed the directions EXACTLY, even putting the planted terrarium in the refrigerator for 8 weeks (which was frustrating AND a pain in the neck) -- and still we have nothing growing -- after weeks and weeks of waiting!  Rotten thing to do to a kid!  The plastic dome is of decent quality, and we got living carnivorous plants from an online seller -- worked out much better.  This is a TOTAL waste of time and money, unfortunately 
 someone wrote this review above, i want to second it.  the book could have been a lot better, was quite disappointing.  i got into the habit of skimming through a lot of pages at a time, the last hundred pages or so are the best and worth reading, the rest is just a quick skim.  "From what I understand, this book is supposed to have some substance. But I just couldn't read it as its terribly written. First of all, it has a distinct feeling of a log book: January 17, I did this, January 17 I did that, in March I flew to New York, etc. Its never highlighted what days and events are important. There are too many acronyms, and too many people to keep track of. The book reeks of bureaucratic, military jargon. There is no in-depth analysis, no sufficient background, - overall, its just bad writing. 
 The book I am going to talk about is the book Arms and the Man By Bernard Shaw. I really did not like this book because it was hard for me to understand.  The reason I didn't like it was because it was challenging for me. The English was hard to understand. I liked how the writer wrote the book and I would probably look for another one of his books. This book was more like an opera with out music. If I could have and known to I probably would not have this enthusiastic about the book. One reason I picked the book was because it was dealing with war and I thought it would have been cool to read about war, but when I got more in to the book it was really not about war it was more about a love at war. If you're an older audience it would be a good book, or if you're looking for a good love-war story. 
 Although the radio still works, the searchlight illuminated only once, the first time I turned it on. It hasn't worked again since.  The radio works while plugged in. Unplug it and come back in an hour and no more charge.  I used the hand crank, I cranked that handle for well over a minute, when I pressed the on button the radio didn't work!  This radio is worthless in an emergency.  I give it one star because this radio does work while plugged in. Plus the dial is well lit illuminating the stations in blue light 
 This book was great.  I especialy liked the chapter where Bill sticks a falafel in his co-worker's hoo-hah.  Priceless 
 For someone suffering from depression, listening to this tape made it worse. I was looking for answers, encouragement and a reason to believe there was hope. Listening to someone speak for a few seconds and then  listen to a depressing oldie and birds chirping made me want to throw it  out of the window 
 I found The Whole Woman more antagonistic and needlessly controversial than enlightening. Greer makes it quite clear that there is exactly one feminist left on the planet, and she is it.  I'm hard-pressed to think of any third-wave feminists who live up to her standards. To do so, you would have to be an earth-mother living in a separatist commune with her lesbian lover. There's nothing wrong with that lifestyle, but it's not one to which most feminists would aspire. It's not one to which I aspire.  Also, it's as limiting a construction of womanhood as the patriarchal one she deplores. What do you do if you are heterosexual? It's all very well for her to say that you can reconstruct yourself as a lesbian, but that's as insulting as the implication that homosexuals just need to try hard enough and they can be heterosexual.   In a similar vein, I found her views of men particularly unpleasant. She suggests in no uncertain terms that they're all potential adulterers, rapists, child-abusers, wife-beaters, misogynists, etc . . . etc . . ., and that any woman who wants an equal, non-exploitative relationship had better become a lesbian. It's hard to see it as anything but pure slander, backed up by the flimsiest of anecdotal evidence. Just because you can cite a few cases of sickos who get turned on by their baby daughters in their nightgowns does not mean that all fathers will inevitably turn to abuse.   The rest of the book is no better. It's very poorly researched and argued, and parts of it verge into the insane. She seems particularly taken with the idea of "primitive" women as whole women, because they aren't bound by Western concepts of femininity. What she doesn't mention is that those women experience the same oppression that Western feminists fought long and hard to overcome. They might not wear bras or high-heels, but that doesn't make them any less oppressed by patriarchy. It seems obvious to me that women from tribal societies do not generally have much real political power, but are doomed to bear lots of children and die young. When she does look at the appalling aspects of those societies, she puts a positive spin on them. There's even a section where she seems to defend female genital mutilation.   Also, I can imagine that some of her ill-informed views are extremely offensive to people in those situations. She describes IVF as patriarchal appropriation of and interference into the process of reproduction. Similarly, she suggests that women who don't opt for natural childbirth (without anaesthetic, of course) are allowing men to remove them from the process. It's utterly disrespectful of the choices women may choose to make, not because they've internalised their oppression but because inseminating themselves with a turkey-baster seems vaguely ludicrous or because they don't want to experience agonising pain.  It's been a while since I read a feminist book that made me angry and this one does so for all the wrong reasons. It makes me embarrassed to call myself a feminist. 
 Do not buy this one. I bought this because i had to compensate for a few dollars to be eligible for free shipping. This product did not work at all. I threw away the headphones, as i couldn't get it replaced 
 	I read this book on the recommendation of two close friends - both of whom are retired English teachers - and both of whom should have known better.  It is one of the most disappointing books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Although other reviewers have commented on some of the same things, I think the book is so bad they bear repeating. 	The characters are so thinly drawn as to be stick figures.  The ambitious young professional woman, the used-up poet turned to drink, the insecure young wife, and the brother who main functions seem to be the guy who brings the boat and to be the near recipient of a "quickie on the rocks."  Who could possibly care about any of them?  Without anyone to care about, the author has no chance of developing suspense and eliciting an emotional response from her readers.  	Switching back and forth between two stories in alternating chapters can work as a plot device, but its success depends upon the two stories being brought together in some convincing fashion at the end.  This doesn't happen, and as if that's not enough, the present day chapters are further split by references to the 1873 murder scattered throughout them.  Clumsy and distracting are the best things one can say about the plot development. 	Even though this is a novel, its characters should behave within the scope of believable human actions.  Asking your husband when he first met the woman you suspect he may be having an affair with is believable; asking him the question when you're in the midst of trying to save yourself and family members in a violent storm at sea is not.  There are other examples of forced dialogue, but this is among the most outrageous. 	Lastly, subtlety is obviously not Ms. Shreve's long suit.  The androgynously named child, Billie, is the only one to suffer the consequences of everyone else's failings.  Gee, is this really the death of innocence?  It's about as nuanced as the murderer's ax on Smuttynose.  And how about the danger of  humorless puritans in the face of  real or supposed sexual variations?  Who would have thought it?   	So why has the book been as popular as it is?  It appeals to the world view of certain young moderns:  Sex is the driving force behind all human actions, the brooding woman is the most fascinating creature in view, and a civility devoid of human feeling is to be prized.     	The Norwegian characters in the historical murder prompt one last reaction.   In downtown Oslo is the Vigelund Sculpture Park.  It is populated with the large and brooding sculptures of Gustav Vigelund, a local sculptor whose work is appreciated almost nowhere else on earth.  If one spends anytime there, one comes away gloomy, perplexed, and with the certain knowledge that an afternoon has been wasted.  Save yourself the expense of a trip to Norway - read The Weight of Water instead

 Ditto the other's observations... The thermostat seems to register the temperature of the unit itself rather than the room... I had the thing in a 63 degree room, had it set to 85 degrees. It would register 90 after 30 seconds of running, turn off, slowly ramp back down to 84 degrees over a 2 minute time period, and then repeat. The temperature of the room never got above 64 degrees.... 
 This author has one heck of a writing style. It's all over the place!  He appears to be a well informed guy, but he's very hard to follow. He uses lots of dashes, parentheses, and notes about other chapters. Plus, there are many overuses of words such as "insofar" and "per se," which disrupt the entire flow of reading. It is not what I expected at all and am pretty disappointed 
 Although the product claims to be a viable additive for shakes/drinks, our experience is it won't dissolve without a blender.    Simply put it clumps.  The taste is fine, actually good, so my recommendation is to look elsewhere for a drink supplement 
 I was assigned this book in a college English course at the University of Chicago. The book is so boring that almost the entire class mutinied and stopped reading it halfway through. The professor conceded and dropped it from the syllabus 
 The paper used to print this worthless screed was wasted. This is a typical geographical put down based on regional stereotyping. Drufresne assumes everyone in a given location is totally ignorant and comical. What an insult! How did this manuscript ever get accepted for publication 
 The author/illustrator of this book has done quite a few other children's books, and my son of 3 years is actually afraid of the pictures in all of them. It teaches colors and recognition of different animals very well, and the colors used are very vibrant and catchy. I love that this book comes in boardbook form, but I am very dissapointed with the illustrations 
 i followed the instructions to the letter , but it only worked about 50 % of the time. i will be sending it bac 
 Word of Honor was so poorly written that I found it hard to finish the book.  Instead of telling the story through one character, the author jumped from one character to another not allowing the reader to identify with any of the characters.  Reading Word of Honor was more like watching TV instead of reading a book.  The conversations between the characters were corny.  I felt like I was watching a poorly written TV soap opera.  The Christian message was dominant and preachy instead of being informative.  The Christian message seemed forced instead of a natural part of the story line.  If I wanted a book that preaches along with a good story line, there are many good books out there that are much better written, ie the BIBLE 
 We've had the same set with Christmas colors for three years.  After the first year, the "whistle" unit (housed in the tender) no longer worked.  And about 10 minutes into running the second year, the engine stopped.  Found that the engine was wired so that the power wire was rubbing a drive wheel.    The engine is built with an underpowered motor, such that a fairly high power setting is required to get it moving and then it runs fast; there is only a tiny operating range before it will fly off on a curve.  The engine is very top heavy and the curves have a tight radius to them.  Finally, when taking the entire engine apart this year found the plastic gears flimsy, badly supported and worn even with recommended oiling.    I still have some of my fathers Lionel trains and these can still be counted on to run today; the new stuff being sold is meant to be in the trash quickly.  
 I have my own business so I decided to give back to community by assisting with Christmas for the unfortunate.  I purchased 7 Amazing Allysen dolls and a plethora of other stuff for the less fortunate.  None of the Allysen dolls work.  I purchased a Amazing Allysen for my little in cousin in Florida also. We tried to make that doll work but it would not.  I went to the local Walmart to purchase another one and it did not work either.  I am totally disappointed with Amazing Allysen.  The kids that I purchased the doll for in Raleigh North Carolina could not find the appropriate things so that I could return the dolls.  I will return the one I purchased for my cousin today because my 30 days are almost up.  This was a horrible experience.  Those kids were expecting to have a super awesome doll, but she did not work.  I felt so bad because it was like I had something to do with it because I purchased so many and none of them worked.  I did have the opportunity to return the doll to Walmart in Florida and purchased an Amanda doll for my little cousin after Christmas.  She really loves Amanda 
 Product OK condition, but took a while for delivery.  Just arrived today, March 13. 
 i bought this thinking that this would be fun and a decent workout, i tried it a few times but just couldnt get in to it. it go's a bit fast but i know i could get used to it, but they have very big steps and they lung into it and i think it would be better if they work up to it i kept finding myself rewinding it to do the step corretly i dont realy strive for perfection i just want to do it some what right. there are better ones out there than this, but i think i am going to try it again cuz it wasnt so bad that i am going to quit it

 Sorry, Babs.  You can't call yourself a Christian and also be so judgmental about your son or the so-called "homosexual lifestyle."  If we're throwing labels around, we might just as well call it "the heterosexual lifestyle." Gimme a break; it's 2004, lady. 
 There is a lot of information in this book. Maybe too much. Even though it says "Serious" in the title, the writers are trying to target everyone from beginners to professionals; they are trying to be all things to all people in all stages of strength training. In doing so, they have muddled the waters. They lose you (at least they did me) in all the definitions, classifications, descriptions, explanations, and reasons. Plus, they are promoting their products. (I guess I can't blame them for that.) It is not a bad book for those that are really serious about strength training. The information is there for those who are meticulous enough to extrapolate it and dedicated enough to put it t use. For those people, I give the book 4 ? stars. For the rest of us who prefer a simpler, more straightforward approach to improving our bodies, there are better books out there 
 Leeches is a terrible movie.  Dude, I have never seen anything so gay in my whole life (except the director's other film Speed Demon).  When the guys were less clothes than the gals, thats not a good sign.  The video shelves at a local corporate video rental store carry tons of this director's work. They're all filled with loads of homoeroticism.  Women are ugly and they were single piece bathing suits whilst the guys wear banana hammocks.  The 'roided up leeches enter their "male" victims through anal orrifices.  After watching about a half hour of this mess I had to turn it off.  Why does this guy fool people into renting these movies.  I don't mind gay subtext in films but when it takes over the film and hits you over the head with it then it's time to draw the line.  No hetro relationships in this one.  Just the director molesting his male stars with his camera.  Horrible stuff, stay away from David DeCoteau's work and his fifty different aliases (unless you know what you're in for) 
 I have read all of Mary Higgins Clark's mysteries and found this one a huge disappointment. I found it almost totally lacking in the kind of tension and suspense that made her other books page turners.  In fact i twice skipped 50 pages just to "get on with it."  I was curious who the real killer was but that question was raised at the beginning and resolved at the end with very little in between 
 If you don't know much about Seinfeld or philosophy you might enjoy this book, but if you're a Seinfeld nut then avoid it at all costs.  The show is incorrectly quoted several times and "facts" are also made up at times.  The summarization of Socrates' allegory of the cave on page nine misstates some pretty major details.  I suffered through the book until page 47 when the writer talks about how Kramer and Mickey embrace communism in the episode "The Race."  Anyone who has seen that show even once knows that Mickey is trying to talk Kramer out of communism throughout the show.  And even though Kramer definitely shows interest in communism it is quite a stretch to say is becomes an "ardent" communist.  Rather than being an enjoyable read this book frustrated me enough that i quit on page 51.  In all fairness the rest of the book may be excellent, but i'll probably never know 
 There is a lot of traffic in Rome.  Especially on the "raccordo annulare", where accidents  are also frequent. The traffic is noisy and dirty, especially when it rains.  Romans swear when they drive and also when they don't.  There are many American tourists in Rome,  especially around the fountains in the piazzas,  where they cluster and sing American songs.  Italian men hit on women tourists, who resist their advances.    "Se vedi gente che lavora, allora non e` Roma".  Romans do not work. No, some of them do, and, in fact, morning till night.   But Rome is not what it used to be.  Everybody knew each other and was polite,  while now everybody is rushed and rude.  Besides, the free love of today has substituted  the brothels of yesterday.  Yes, some of the brothels were chic, while others less so.   Rome was bombed in the Second World War. In fact,  bombing would sometimes interrupt a theatrical  performance. The public then proceeded to the  shelter, where flirting and lovemaking would ensue.   The Roman aristocracy is close to the Papal Court.  They run parties together, even fashion shows.  Cardinals complain that outsiders try to teach the Pope  how to rule the Church.   And, yes! Motoryclists can and do go around the  Colosseum, providing a tasteless final sequence.   One leaves the cinema with a heavy sense of wasted time.   Does Fellini really have nothing at all to say  about the Eternal City? After all his years there? Nothing except the  standard collection of stereotypes  about Italians, stereotypes that occur in every  scurrilous joke, that are met on the pages of every trashy guide?    It is true that there are a few nice sequences, especially  the often mentioned one of the destruction of the frescoes.    And then, the great Anna Magnani appears for about 10 seconds to tell Fellini she won't talk to him.    That is perhaps also a scene worth watching.   But the rest is commercial cinema.   "Vai a dormi', Federico".    
 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 Having received an Amazon email indicating that I might be interested in this book, I thought I'd take a look, since the title sounded like something that might have some value. Without having actually read the book, but having perused the Amazon "peeks" inside, and the reviews here, I feel compelled to offer my own opinion.   From the cover photo, which presents a fifties-style, beautiful, perfectly-groomed, stereotyped woman, whose face takes up more cover space than the rather non-descript man, the agenda of the book is clear. The premise and arguments of this book are nothing more than right-wing, androcentric nonsense. Based upon my doctoral research in gender and power, the differences that Rhoads would like to take so seriously are differences that can all be attributed to imbalances in power, both interpersonally and culturally. Rhoads' argument seems to be that since it's "always been this way" and "look, everybody's doing it," then it must be the "right" thing. Well, those who have the power will do or say anything to keep it (or, "conserve" it, as conservatives are wont to do).   As a single mother who has raised a male child to be a warm, nurturing, verbally communicative, house-cleaning, clothes-ironing, picks-up-after-himself, listens-well-to-others, loyal, monogamous, baby-changing, kid-loving, hardworking, ambitious, sports-playing, car-fixing, tool-loving heterosexual man who has established secure, supportive attachments with men and women, I can attest to the mental and emotional health and social and interpersonal success of a child raised by a woman to be androgynous. As a parent this means nothing more than supporting and encouraging the full range of personal skills, talents and leanings that a child may have, in order to encourage a well-balanced human being who is able to effectively navigate life and its varieties of relationships. The true differences between men and women are small, and study after study has shown that the differences among women and among men are far greater than the differences between the sexes. Other studies show pretty clearly that persons higher in androgynous traits are mentally healthier. The right-wing reluctance to acknowledge this exacerbates the "war between the sexes" rather than alleviates it.  The title of this book gives the appearance that the work itself is serious research. That is the most frightening part of this book. This book is simply nonsense disguised as research propping up the right wing conservative efforts to keep both women and men in their traditional right wing, conservative  "places," neither of which truly benefits men, women, children or society at large.   However, the viewpoint of this book may offer comfort to people who hold on to the wish that their own childhood had included the cocoon of having grown up like Wally and the Beave did. Unfortunately, the fantasy families of the Cleavers, the Andersons and the Nelsons were just that- fantasies. 
 As a psychiatrist and person with mentally ill family members, I can only bemoan all of the misinformation contained in this book. The truth is that many of the mentally ill in America do not get the treatment they need precisely because they believe the things said in this book, on tv, etc. As someone who has lived outside of the US and in the developing world, I can tell you that their mental health treatment pales compared to what is available in the United States and is much more primitive and coercive. Although it is true that many psychiatric medications have serious side effects, the consequences of living with symptoms of a serious mental illness can only convince you of how devastating that can be to both the ill person and his or her family. Furthermore, as someone who is also experienced in administering ECT, I can personally attest to the wonderful success rate of this treatment for persons with severe depression who have failed all alternatives and who would rather be dead than live out their lives. (And many, unfortunately, do decide on death as a last resort).  As far as lobotomies, ice baths, and forced stays in hospitals or other facilities, these are things of the past in the United States. In fact, one of the biggest problems I face in my practice is the extreme difficulty I have in placing someone in the hospital when they actually need a brief stay (typical stays are 5-7 days) because of a lack of psychiatric beds ( more than 90% of psychiatric beds were eliminated from American hospitals in the last 15 years as a cost-cutting measure). The other problems faced by modern psychiatry still includes stigmatisation of the mentally ill and then all the more mundane issues such as needs for help with housing, employment, and job development. But I bet you wouldn't find the author writing a book about that 
 I bought 300 and 500 units. They are not working in my small condo. I cannot find the place to see how they finally work 
 "The Book of Honor" is an extremely well written account of the lives and families of CIA agents who died for their country.  Unfortunately, the author spends more time describing the homes where these heroes grew up rather than the circumstances under which they perished.  Not only does it not place enough emphasis on covert operation (or the reasons for them), the book is written from an antagonistic perspective.  Throughout the book, the author continually takes jabs at the CIA and U.S. covert operations community.  There are some interesting historical facts lightly sprinkled through out its pages, but not nearly enough to make it worthwhile.  If you want a little action and insight into the lives of individuals as CIA operatives, please look for another book to read.  If you are looking for mundane letters between boyfriend and girlfriend or mother and son, this book is for you 
 I'm not so sure about the integrity of the publisher of a book that serves an aid to the wallet but an adversary to the eyes of one who is not so accustomed to reading such an esoteric font 
 I bought this book while rushing through an airport terminal needing something to read on the plane.  Not one of my better decisions.  Very wordy, and the dialogue is so clipped and stilted it's totally absurd -- reminds me of the way the cops talked in "Dragnet."  We are talking zero development of characters.  Perhaps Mr. Woods feels he doesn't need to give any depth to characters that he's been writing about in previous books.  Well, he's wrong.  You basically just don't care about these people.  They aren't real, and they talk weird.  Not much action either, unless you count actions like:  they got in the car; they got in the boat; they got in the plane.  You get the picture.  This is another case of a well-known author throwing something together so he can get it on the newsstand and rob you of your money.  Don't fall into his trap like I did.  There are a lot better books out there. 
 I don't keep up with every single Ludlum book, and when I bought this in paperback I'd just assumed it was one of his earlier ones that I'd missed--since I was aware that he'd died.  About 15 pages into it I found myself looking back at the front to make sure I had the right book--the writing style was juvenile.  It felt like a high school kid's first attempt at a spy novel.    Then I looked at the printing date and realized I'd been ripped of by the publisher!  Ludlum did not write this, and it is so painfully obvious.  I trudged through another 100 pages or so--you know--figuring that I'd invested some time in it and it might get better. It never did.    I admit to not finishing it and I know I'm not missing anything. Just to get as far as I did was a tedious chore.    Robert Ludlum would be writhing in his grave if he knew the slop that St. Martin's Paperbacks is peddling in his name 
 I wanted to see a romantic and touching movie.  This movie is contrived. The character that Reeve plays acts like a star-struck groupie.  Personally, I don't find his behavior to be romantic.  He seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him.  This is not romantic to most women nowadays.  He is not suave in the role he is playing.  It seems like a cheesy 70's contrived romance that does a bad job of it 
 When I was looking for a beginners book on Frontpage, this seemed like a good buy. I was WRONG. This is truly a book for dummies. I hate the way the Dummy Series seem to be written like you are in a classroom with one of those instructors that love to make cute comments and crack dumb jokes. I will never buy another Dummy Series book. This book is a waste of money. The built-in help with Frontpage is better.. 
 This book stinks. It's filled with a little of everything but not enough of the right information. Pass... if you really want to see the book check it out of the library and save the money 
 I just finished listening to as much of the book on CD as I could stomach.  The minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating.  The words forhead, perp, peruse, crim, and finger were repeated over and over and over.  What might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone's clothing, spouses, children, and thinking 
 I still have not recieved my DVD. Please send it to me so I can review. Thanks Lisa Van Gieso 
 I was left with the feeling that all of this has been said before in one form or another, Where it was ' new' there are other who have already explored the space ( eg The Suport Economy by Shoshana Zuboff)  There are two many big words hidding little concepts. The case studies are simplistic  and look to the past rather than casting light on the future. This will be another 'fad" and like all fads find its place in the dustbins of business book 
 A dilemma suggests two views, a situation where a difficult choice must be made.  The author presents only one view.  Over and over again she tells stories of unhappy adults who were paralyzed by the gifted label and the experience of being pushed by extreme parents.  While I believe these stories and pain are genuine, I cannot understand why Ms. Quart does not speak of other adults who have thrived, those who look back fondly on their gifted education and the enrichments their parents offered. She mentions the current Spelling Bee pronouncer and former champion, Jacques Bailly. In other venues Bailly has frequently spoken how much he believes in academic competition and how much he enjoyed the experience as a child. But here Bailly is only quoted when he registers a complaint.   Stories of positive experiences never are mentioned.  The balance would have made this book live up to the subtitle.  The crucial flaw of the book is that Ms. Quart completely misses the point about gifted children. She speaks of giftedness as something forced on children (or as a classification "bought" by wealthy families.).  Anyone who spends time with a truly gifted child knows that the push comes from the child. No parents of a gifted child would ever credit the Baby Einstein videos for their child's intellectual curiousity.    And gifted children do ask for academic pre-schools and weekly trips to the museum, and very much enjoy spending hours in a small room being quizzed by an adult. (This may not be a good thing, but it is a real thing.)    I expected the book to examine the actual dilemma parents face--how much should the parent nurture the child's requests, and how much should the children be encouraged to "just go out and play"  even though they resist?  By dismissing the key element of the child's desires in this equation, Ms. Quart eliminates any value to her argument.    This book does nothing to help gifted children, nor to guide their parents or teachers. 
 I thought my first year of college was tough. But "Nathan" has it worse, and she did this while on a sabbatical! She took on a challenging task, one that many professors have probably considered as being interesting but impossible to pull off. This ground-level view of college life has some merit and charm, with limits. This book reads for me as a reference work for other anthropologists, not for students or their parents. See especially the "liminal" section, pp. 146-148, and the eleven-page (158-168) postscript on ethnography; the text is otherwise 157 pages. And I am less concerned about the ethics of this covert role than I am about the authenticity and usefulness of the (self-reported) data and the reliability of her field observations. There were several lessons I learned but only by reading between the lines.  1.Upon starting her quest, "Nathan" immediately notices the mountains of "stuff" new students bring to their dorms. "Nathan" brings a microwave and a wok to her dorm room, and she is at the low end of the "stuff" scale. Rather than take a head count of students, like the author did, she could take an inventory of the `stuff' students bring with them to college. This would speak volumes about culture, behaviors, norms, and rituals. Too much stuff translates into too little time to be college students. The irony is that the time students spend employed rather than studying cannot begin to pay for the cars and unnecessary paraphernalia they possess.  2."Nathan" seems bewildered at the university's absence of a sense of community and intellectual diversity. Demographic diversity and a wide range of previous educational experiences in the recruited student body can drive out the sense of community universities claim to seek. Universities "recruit for diversity," pay lip service to its manifestations and limits, and then wonder why students fail to see themselves or to develop as a community. And the open forum for the free exchange of ideas failed some time ago (see "assaults," below) when the educational system stopped having an idea of how to reach or motivate students. Universities punish truly free expression, disperse dated rhetoric, and wonder why students have nothing they care to say in class. Faculty need to be more creative, engaging, and accountable. If they want student participation, faculty need to develop it, measure it and grade it. If faculty want students to be interested in required material, faculty need to make sure students know why it is required. And if a faculty member wonders why students don't make use of office hours, that faculty member needs to ask if "office hours" are the best way to reach students.  3.Communication technology separates rather than draws us together. And its not just iPods (although this book is pre-iPod), cell phones, laptops and PDAs. When students have televisions in their rooms, is it any wonder they don't need to go to a common room to watch the Super Bowl? Television does not bring us together; it isolates us. And it lulls the brain into a passive state. But she glosses over the fact that every student needs to have one. Why?  4.Foreign students mistakenly believe that only American students are nave about foreign culture. When students from fifteen different foreign countries complain that Americans fail to appreciate the foreign student's own country, that foreign student is more ignorant and arrogant than are the Americans they decry. Foreign students tend to "know" their own country and their stereotypes about America; American students are not much different.  5."Nathan" asked students for their "perfect" course. The author's description of the students' "perfect" course (which turned out to be a course on sex -- surprise!) is perfect only in the sense that the students enjoyed it. For a student to tell her teacher she "enjoyed" a course says very little about the teacher or the content, only that it was fun, or in the author's words, "perfect". Too bad "Nathan" didn't ask for the courses where students learned the most, or that administrators reserve the curriculum for courses that do more than titillate.  6."Nathan" toys with the idea of locating old tests for a course as cheating (p. 124), without ever really deciding if it is or is not "cheating". She says that unlike the faculty view, students view cheating with many "subtleties and complexities". I think she's wrong on both points. Studying old tests is not cheating and faculty see even more subtleties and complexities in cheating than do students. She cites an article that describes cheating as like "stealing signs in baseball," and that just misses the point of cheating completely, or at least it offers a juicy if unjustified rationalization.  You'd probably get a better understanding of campus values and academic norms reading ratemyprofessors.com posts from "Nathan's" school, Northern Arizona. But then things get worse. "Nathan" decries "student assaults...on academics critical of U.S. foreign policy," while ignoring academic assaults on students' beliefs and values. She spends five pages on a relatively poor economic analysis of higher education: she adjusts tuition costs for inflation but neglects rapid increases in financial aid; she claims students need to work to go to school, ignoring the cost of the "stuff" and lifestyle of carousing noted above; she complains about states and the federal government paying a smaller portion of the university budget while ignoring the fact that much of that budget has little or nothing to do with education; and she decries the decline in majors such as philosophy, history and English literature while ignoring the overproduction of PhDs in these areas and the decline as more relative than absolute. You can't double the US population in fifty years and increase the college-going rate from 16% to 61.7% and not have to stretch some budgets 
 I feel ripped off in that the description of the book said the complete works of Van Gogh, and I thought it was 1 big book. Instead I got a much smaller hardbound, only part 2 
 The book is of course excellent. However the cd is anoying because the authors somehow did not make it upwardly compatable with the newest version of adobe reader (7.x). Therefore one needs to remove the latest version of adobe reader and install version 6.x . The two versions of adobe reader are not allowed to exist on a windows system at the same time 
 I cannot believe this is the same person who wrote that fantastic book, Absolute Power.  David, what happened????  The story is very fascinating but the characters were not.  I found myself rooting for the villian who is definitely a very bad person.  But our herione, LuAnn, is not believable.  He has her as a backward hick who does not have a social security number on one hand and then he has her acting like a genius on the other hand.  There were just too many up and downs for me.  I am sure the next book will be back on track 
 Before I review, I'd like to clear something up: I am a very latecomer in seeing this movie. I was introduced to the Ghost in the Shell franchise through the new Anime series airing on Adult Swim, Ghost in the Shell: Standalone Complex. I absolutely love that show, and so I figured eventually I'd have to get around to seeing the movie, which I knew full well shares no connection with the show. They're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name, (which I have not read, so I don't know which is more accurate) but the TV series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way.  There are many things I don't like about this movie, the biggest being poor pacing. The plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler, but that's the biggest problem. There's not really enough story to last a full-length feature, because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short. And since they didn't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes (there are barely any, and they aren't very impressive for the most part) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you won't understand more than 60% of, and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we're looking at either nothing, or a woman's nipples. That's not cinematic artistry, that's being either lazy or perverted.  The animation itself isn't even that good, especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago. It's choppy, and there's not really a whole lot of detail (except when it comes to women's nipples). Looking at just the animation, if I didn't know better, I'd have thought this movie was an OVA from the 1980's.  The only thing I can really say I liked about this movie was that it was Ghost in the Shell. It's probably kind of like how I didn't see the 1989 Batman movie until years after I'd been spoiled by Batman the Animated Series, and couldn't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was Batman. Everything about the TV series is superior to this movie: the animation, the stories, the character developement, the production values... I could go on for an entire page about how much better the TV series is.  In short, if you're you're at all interested in the GITS franchise, do yourself a favor and rent the DVDs of the TV show instead. You'll find a lot to love, but I can't say the same about the movie. My dream is that someday Alex Proyas will give us a GITS movie that lives up to what I would hope for after watching Standalone Complex 
 There is nothing I could add here that wasn't already said by the other 1 star reviewers that preceeded me. Just a couple of generic trends: 1. Lots of books get published (and unfortunately read) based on the author's name. Although Moss Cnater has never belonged to the senior guru league (in my opinion and I have read her revious works - tedious and uninspiring), Harvard Business school still carries some weight, although one has to wonder why, based on many distinctly ordinary, even bad books they publish through their Press. And if you read Harvard Business Review, you should have realised by now how mediocre and way overpriced that publication is.  2. One reviewer wonders how could she, a professor at already mentioned uni write so badly. People erroneously associate things together. Just because somebody teaches at a university does not make them good writers; heck, it doesn't even make them good teachers. How many truly great teachers do you remember from your uni days? Zussamenfassung (a weird German word for Summary): Avoid like a plague 
 I bought this and it worked fine the first time that I used it.  Granted, it was late summer and the house was pretty warm so it was not to difficult to steam up the bedroom.  However, I have tried it in my infant's room 4 times this winter.  I used HOT water & salt to try to help it, but the darn thing does not have enough power to make the steam.  Maybe all of the "steam" energy is being used on the night light!  If you have your home's thermostat set under 78 degrees, do not waste your money on this item!  Find something stronger to get you through the winter months 
 The best thing about the Magellean 3000T is the large screen.   Sometimes this gadget works like a charm--other times it just seems to pay no attention.  Actually, the touch screen function decides not to work.  You can sit there and touch, rub, hammer; to no avail.  I got tired of the whole process and was ready to send it back to Amazon.  First, I called Magellan's help line (the phone number was hard to find); apparently you go to the diagonostic page and touch each touchscreen icon.  If you hear a click, it's okay.  Finally it works most of the time.  Damn bunch of trouble and frustration for a machine designed to reduce trouble and frustration.  
 I have read many poker books, and now that I'm half way through with this one, I can honestly say that this is one of the worst.   The psychology is about as deep as the cover. The author presumes you have no skill or ability - like him he adds - and offers a rigid mechanical rating system that is completely incompatible with today's game, (particularly the internet games).   The end of this book is filled with doomsday predictions for those who want to make a living playing. He insists that the pro's make less money than average doctors or lawyers. Unfortunately, his findings are based on a study that was conducted in the 70's. This book may have been published in 2000 initially, but it seems like it was written in the 80's. Perhaps this is a nice gift for someone who already has every other poker book 
 its tough when you watch and work out to a video that has people leading that shouldn't be on film, this was a one time viewing that i cannot watch or try agai 
 If you see yourself as a strong, intelligent woman, DO NOT read this book. The 'heroine' is anything but!  Her rationalizations of why not to report key information regarding a murderer to her 'wonderful Texas Ranger' husband, and her reluctance to 'clue' this hunk in on her lucrative business, is beyond any normal persons reasoning. And her teen aged daughters behaviors?  Is anyone that foolish? Oh, and can she possible squeeze "Texas Ranger" into anymore sentences...on the SAME page? Normally I consider all books worth reading, but I'll not soon pick up another one of Carla's.  
 Way too much money was put into the movie.  The cast is way too old.  It completely lost all of the grittiness and the pain of the play.  It's very unfortunate that there was an opportunity to immortalize one of the great landmarks of the contemporary musical theatre and this is all we ended up with 
 Don't let this book scare you away from going to law school. Montauk suggests a JD will only be helpful for a career in law, yet he is now a consultant. If someone has Richard Montauk's address, let me know. I'd like to send him back this book 
 Contrary to the title, I found the book more on the theoretical side. Lots of classifications with questionable practical value. The examples are high-level ending up with more classifications. Same observation about the simplistic figures. Chapter 13-The World Wide Web gives an introduction of the initial Web requirements, while Chapter 16-J2EE/EJB explains general ideas about EJB. My benchmark for an "solid" book, with somehow related topic, would be "Design Patterns" by Gamma,Helm,Johnson,Vlissides 
 A great portion of the book is very boring. I really felt like rushing through the book. I don't recommend this book to other 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 Some passages in "Hollywood Babylon II" strongly echo "Hollywood's Unsolved Mysteries," an obscure pulp paperback by John Austin, written in 1969-1970.      "The girl's head was frightfully battered but that was the least of it" ("Hollywood's Unsolved Mysteries," Page 82, Black Dahlia case).      "The victim's head had been bashed almost beyond recognition-but that wasn't the worst of it." (Hollywood Babylon II, Page 127-130, Black Dahlia case). 
 This product had been given to me to help me relax.  I suffer from an anxiety disorder and the chiropractor said it is good for it.  DO NOT TAKE this if that is the case.  It made me sick as a dog.  I went to my doctor and he prescribed me medicine that is for people like me who has anxiety attacks.  I was then made aware that Herbel Remedies can make anxiety worse and not better.  Always check with a doctor before taking this 
 ***This is a discussion about certain points in the book, and may be considered to some a spoiler, so please do not read if you want to remain surprised about the book's high points and/or outcome.***  I expected to read this book and feel inspired by the obstacles that were overcome by Chris Gardner as he rose from a poverty-stricken child living the hard knock life to a successful adult with many moral achievements. However, this was not the case. Shortly into the book, I came to realize that most of Mr. Gardner's problems were self-created. Sure, his upbringing was a contributory factor to some of his issues. But mostly, he made some very bad choices that resulted in some very bad outcomes.  First, I disliked how he constantly put his mother, the woman who allowed herself and her children to be beaten time and time again by her husband, on a pedastool. This was a woman who went to prison twice, once for welfare fraud and once for attempted murder, yet we are to believe she was the epitomy of moral conscience? In all fairness, it is respectable that Mr. Gardner continued to idolize his mother, even after his rough childhood and the abuse to which he was subjected at home. However, this woman exemplified so many reasons why she was the complete opposite of an ideal role model for a child.  Second, I thought it extremely irresponsible of Mr. Gardner to discuss not being able to afford to put food on the table for his wife and child some days, and in the next sentence to talk about getting high with his buddies to "take the edge off". Certainly the drugs were not always free. Was he spending the family's grocery money on drugs?   Third, I disliked how he rationalized listening to jokes containing the infamous "N" word from the rich oil tycoon, simply because this same man was fattening his pockets at the time. This tells the world that such a situation is acceptable, so long as someone benefits enough to overlook the insulting word. I also found it absolutely disgusting how Mr. Gardner, immediately upon hearing of this oil tycoon's death, sold every bit of stock in the man's portolio, even though he himself admitted that all stock sales should immediately halt once an estate is in probate. Mr. Gardner stated that the oil tycoon, in the days before his death, had requested that all of his portfolio assets be liquidated (never mind the history of 30-35% capital gains), and that Mr. Gardner was only carrying out his final "orders". I call Mr. Gardner's bluff on this one - he sold that stock just to make a final commission. Mr. Gardner showed a true lack of ethics in this situation.  Finally, and most disturbing, was how Mr. Gardner sent his son to live with Jackie after she had already once abandoned the child. She had proven herself once to be an unfit mother, yet Mr. Gardner sent his son across the country to live with her after he starting achieving personal financial success in Chicago. If his main concern was the welfare of his child, why did he not keep little Chris with him?  Overall, I am completely dissapointed with this book. Mr. Gardner may be hailed as a hero to some, but he is most certainly not a hero to me.     
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 I look at the average raiting for this movie. # stars, now thats supposed to mean its ok. Well ppl, this plotless load of junk is getting more than it deserves. I read some review saying the musicwas good, and, well, from my perspective It seemed like the music was played at entirely random moments. Like it could skip from a fight scene to a dramatic we feel sorry for darkman moment, and i would almost barely knotice, if it wasnt for stupid clips they play of images that make no sense. It was like they didnt know what to show so they figured this is kinda how he feels so lets just put this here. Save your money. I bought this after seeing the first, which was lame, but i though it was ok, and hoping this one would hae like maybe better action sequences or something. Well this was in 6th grade. HUGE mistake i hated it when i first saw it. It seemed like they wanted to make a sequel but never got around to doing it. And about the actrion sequences it looked like i was at six flags watching that batman show they play. Good, considering its live, but lame as far as movies get.  Oh, and the villians who were supposed to seem smart or truly evil, just seemed spiteful and annoyingly upsessed with killing. I really think this is one of the most absolutely stupid films ever made. But that was untill I saw reptillian. Which is kinda depressingly awfull 
 One has to admire Wittig for persisting. _The Lesbian Body_ is an extended love letter from one Amazon (not an Amazon.com!) to the woman she loves. The book can have an intermittently disconcerting fascination, and it is agreeably off putting, with first person pronouns divided up ("m/e" [and in the French version "j/e"]), presumeably to break down language false to the lesbian self and the experience of love the book wishes to embody. Moreover, the attraction of the narrator for her inamorata is not confined to anything like usual romantic palaver; it can derive from, say, sweat. It is often expressed in violence. "Under m/y frantic pressure your head becomes detached at the level of the cervical vertebrae." I guess this is love, if between consenting adults.  I don't find the new language _more_ satisfactory or illuminating; it is just different, for the sake being so, nor for me does feminizing the characters in the _Iliad,_ as _The Lesbian Body_ does, add to an understanding of them or make the stories alluded to more moving, entertaining, true, or, given the sketchiness of the references, much unlike what they were in Homer.  Interrupting the paeans of love, at apparently arbitrary points, are lists of body parts, often sounding like extracts from a medical textbook. "THE DORSALS THE ILIACS THE TERES THE QUADRATI." Is this the inevitability of the phsyical? Or a remaking of love in a way the outside, non-revolutionary world will or must find foreign?  The best that can be said about this experiment is that, like the writing of Gertrude Stein, it can shake the reader out of traditional ideas of fiction or writing and bust up stale social notions. By the last page, 165, I had had enough. It was actually more fun to write this review than to read the book 
 My Grandma baked EVERY day and always used a Sunbeam mixer.  That is why I bought this one, but I am disappointed with it.  It is very reasonably priced and the motor has been powerful enough for the baking that I do, but those are the only two good things I can really say about it.  When mixing, ingredients fly out of the bowl all over the counter and me.  When adding flour, no matter how slowly, a cloud of flour dust covers everything within about a 5-foot radius of the mixer.  I have even tried mixing with a towel over the top of the mixer just to help eliminate some of the dust.  Also, I have arthritis and have found the beater realase button extremely hard to push.  I guess this mixer is a good buy for someone who will not use it very often because it is a good price, but a person who will be using it a lot may want to invest in something better 
 I was very disappointed by this guidebook. I added nothing to the Eyewitness Travel Guide. I highly recommend the latter 
 I returned this book. I suspect the author wrote it for herself, not for young children. The rhymes are forced, the pictures inadequate, and the premise self-serving. That is, the author advertises her posters and website. Really, what little kid wants to read a book about the life of a carpool mom? - Reader in Denve 
 just awful  save your money, this book is not worth it. The pictures are dull and lifeless, boring composition. Mann hasn't captured anything here but a bunch of worthless photos. Any 10th rate amateur photographer could have done better. 
 Yawn..............I used to enjoy Silverberg's books and stories. What has changed? Not very well done. I cannot recommend this 
 This episode is the darkest and possibly the weakest of the three. If this movie is being shown to children, parents should preview it first and fast forward through some of the parts. 
 While containing a number of intersting plans for small homes, this book falls short on several accounds.  First, there is almost no text save what is on the inside of the jacket.  That's right: no introduction, no methodology.  There is no explanation of which competitions the plans were taken from or what awards they won. (Amusingly, I went to show my neighbor one of the plans that I liked.  He said he liked it too but that it was an old plan from a competition in the early 90's. And would you believe that he happened to have a copy of the competition from which the plan was taken!)     Secondly, as to the plans themselves, dimensions are rarely marked and often unclearly.  In the case of two or three of the plans this makes them nearly unintelligable.   The lack of wall sections or descriptions of materials used for the majority of the plans makes it impossible to understand the particulars of what makes the houses energy effecient.   In short, the book far from lives up to its description and isn't worth spending the money for a handful of plans since a person can look at plans all day long for free online.   
 I have the VHS tape of this movie, I really like it. I decided to buy the DVD version for better image quality and some bonus features. But I found that the image quality is not better than VHS version. And there is absolutely no single bonus feature. You can only choose, "play main feature". Even worse, it does not even have any caption or subtitle. At least the VHS had closed caption. This DVD is sort of "just watch once and throw it to the garbage can" quality. If so, why don't you buy a better featured VHS  
 I would never have bought this movie for myself - I think the movie is lame.  I borrowed it from my nephew to see it and a friend "borrowed" and never returned it.  I just bought it because I owed my nephew the movie.  There were very few original funny moments in it 
 This book was conceived from an incorrect perception of "America". United States is not only America. What about the other countries such Mexico, Peru, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Argentina, etc. Maybe, the correct title for this book is "Some surnames in United States of America". Since the United States of America were forged with immigrants, the author did not respect the particularities of other surnames established in the United States as jews, russians, germans, frenchs, irish, among others 
 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
 This treatment of Lean Manufacturing is written from the American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) viewpoint. The center of the manufacturing world for the production control dept. is the MRP software which makes this viewpoint on Lean interesting, especially since two of the major advantages of implementing Lean is to reduce inventories and to eliminate production control department overhead. The only requirements for MRP in a lean environment are long term raw material scheduling and finished product delivery scheduling.  Hobbs does not establish the roots of Lean (The Toyota Production System) nor does he use Japanese lean terms with the exeption of Kanban and Kaizen. Nor does he recognize the existence of the value stream map (VSM)  choosing to use the process flow diagram (PFD) to define the manufacturing process. Thus Hobbs only defines process level manufacturing data and totally ignores the systems approach to lean Manufacturing. As a result the Lean Enterprise, total lead time, and how the manufacturing process relates to the whole value stream are not even adddressed. He is, however, quick to use total lead time in his so called 'Strategic Business Analysis'. Finally, the key concept of pull/flow production control is not fully compared to push/MRP production control. Herein lies the proof that pull/flow is superior. This is the only treatment of lean manufacturing I have found that espouses providing for scrap and rework in the manufacturing process. There is no jidoka even mentioned. Somehow the term 'MRP' shows up on almost every page. This book should be labeled 'In Defense of MRP'. There is no bibliography - all original?  1) A lean practitioners publication     2/10 2) A lean managers publicaton           4/10 3) Clear thought/Organization           3/10 4) Information Content                  2/10 5) New or original content              2/10 6) Topical relevance                    2/1 
 Spiritual memoirs tend to follow the same plot line.  It's the boy meets girl story with God substituted for the girl.  There's nothing wrong with the formula, the author's job is to make it fresh and interesting.  Dan Wakefield doesn't get the job done.  The structure of "Returning" is linear, the pace is ponderous, and the insights only moderately interesting.  In fact, the entire book is an exercise in moderation, written by a moderate talent, who, on the evidence presented, has lived a moderate life.  It's no wonder Bill Moyer's, a paragon of moderation, liked this book.  There are parts of this book where the author could have revealed more.   The account of his nervous breakdown is scary, but all too brief, and on too many occasions - bouts of adolescent [activity], unsuccessful psychoanalysis, addiction to alcohol - Mr. Wakefield seems like a kid in a confessional.  He rushes through his sins in order to be unburdened, but also undiscovered.  It doesn't work.  If we give the penitent the benefit of our attention, he should give us the benefit of a compelling story 
 I think not!  As someone who has reached that stage of life where I find ritual a very valuable and reassuring aspect of life, I was completely disapointed by this book.  It should be called "Burn a Candle and  Smell Something."  Her only approach to rituals are things that the  normal populace would find just a tad suspect.  I don't need to  ritualistically burn mementos to special music by the light of a specific  colored candle while inhaling sandlewood, etc.  Genuine ritual has great  value - this just trivializes life transitions 
 The point of language immersion is to put the student in an environment where the new language is used exclusively. Every CD in this set has more English than French.  Rather than being immersed in French, the student barely gets wet.  Instead, it repeats the standard approach, and is just like most of the language learning materials not claiming to be using the "immersion" method. Extremely disappointing 
 Yeesh. The title of this book, Suburban Sweatshops:  The Fight for Immigrant Rights would lead you to believe that it's an expansive look at a *nationwide* problem - would it not?. Well, it's actually a very cerebral discussion of the author's own (commendable) work setting up the Workplace Project, a small resource center for immigrant workers in Long Island. Still sounds interesting, doesn't it? Well, it might have been, in other hands, but we actually learn remarkably little about the workers.  We meet a few individuals - or rather, "case histories" - but the author is a lawyer, not a writer, so while we're told a lot about the workers' grievances, we learn very little about their actual lives (and nothing whatever about the other side of the story, if any). Mostly, it's a lot of chin-rubbing about legal and organizational strategies for increasing the influence of Long Island wage-earners. Perhaps the publisher thought that giving the book this broad title (it ought to have been called something like, "MY Fight for Immigrant Rights") would increase sales. It worked on me - 20 bucks later I have a book I don't want and my only way of defending myself is . . . this indignant review. The reason it gets two stars instead of one is because Gordon has done so much good work for our country and, in particular, the most exploited and neglected among us. I would much rather have contributed the 20 bucks directly to her organization. 
 I had to read this book for a course on Latin America. The author is clearly very biased, if you agree with him you will most likely enjoy the book. Chasteen often states his opinions as fact, stating several times that marxism would have been a better option for Latin American countries (how well did this work in the USSR?) Also, he skips over details that don't support his thesis; while he goes in great detail describing the killing and torture commited by government forces, he never acknowledges the torture and murders commited by guerrilla forces.   The book does cover a great deal of history, but the excessive bias takes away from the credibility of the text and the learning experience. I would reccomend finding a book that focuses more on fact than opinion 
 The title of this book is deceptive.  The author's major RV experience was in driving an 18' motorhome and she definately feels that anything larger is more like staying at home than camping.  If you are interested in RV related material, this book is not for you.  If you want a so so travelogue with minimal information about where to park your RV, you might like the book.  The author obviously has no experience in using RVs in urban environments--something than most owners of large RVs do on a routine basis.  I think the title is highly misleading 
 This is a pretty lame comedy, not much more than formula junk, though there is some good writing and the actors are truly fine.  Alas, nothing  new emerges, and the thought that the Nicolson character cd learn and grow - not only at his age but given his character - is ridiculous and ultimately ruins the impact of the film.  It is too bad, because Keaton and Nicolson are such graet actors that they cd have done something original, even pathbreaking.  Instead, it is just less rather than more 
 Mostly rambling nonsense.  Felt like the time I spent reading this was wasted.  Here's a guy who says his hero is that nut that tied a bunch of helium balloons to his lawn chair and made his way onto the list of people likely to be darwin award candidates 
 I just finished listening to as much of the book on CD as I could stomach.  The minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating.  The words forhead, perp, peruse, crim, and finger were repeated over and over and over.  What might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone's clothing, spouses, children, and thinking 
 I received a novelty: A book without text!!!!!!!!!!!! Completely blank, except for the front and back cove 
 I read all these great reviews and must admit I was REALLY disappointed.  I thought it would be a yoga dvd I could do with my child and she could have fun while I got at leaset a litle of my workout in.  WRONG.  It is more like a visual encyclopedia of kid "yoga" poses.  The yoga guy talks about the pose and "kid chats" a bunch, but RARELY is the one demonstrating the poses. I do not want to suffer though it again for an exact quote but basically he says things like "Camel pose is great, do you want to be a camel???  Camels this and camels that, bla bla bla camels".  The whole while sitting there looking at you not doing the pose he is talking about and just talking while looking at the camara.  Not even telling you what to actually do, just talking up the virtues and fun of the next pose.  I would give it a 5 if it were a 2 part dvd with an actual yoga routen you could do that put all these poses together.  The host talks longer than you do the pose it felt like.  Definately not a break a sweat or high energy dvd.  LOTS of down time and chatter with NO flow or routen.  It will not remain on my shelf.  If you are looking for a DVD with tons of talk and lots of gaps between movement than this is the one for you 
 While Guy Grand's pranks are amusing, the book lacks any real satirical center or dramatic structure, which would give it some meaning (and some real bite).  You could take the chapters out of their present sequence, reassemble them in any order, and the book would be just as effective --- and that's about as damning a criticism as I can think of.  The book utlimately is a washout.  It starts and stops in the same place, and in between the narrative just meanders from episode to episode without any real idea of what it wants to do, or how to do it.  Not Southern's best, by any means, but better than tripe like CANDY 
 Some movies try to rip off another film with dignity. This sets right off telling you "Not all aliens come from space." Gee...what could THIS be a rip-off of?  The reviewer before me is pretty head-on about first impressions. I had high hopes for this movie first setting out - it had a good set-up, great sets, some good early suspense, and it looked to be an OK sci-fi film. Then they show you the "alien." Yes, they hold the suspense for a few good seconds before going, "Here ya go." Then the rest of the film is the alien killing off the crew bit by bit (which isn't terribly hard since twice they gang attack it IN THE WATER with WEAK WEAPONS). It then is killed by electrical shock in the water...only to come back a few minutes later as if nothing happened. *sigh* Don't you ever feel like so many monster films were inspired by that classic Holy Grail quote? You know, when John Cleese stammers: "I got better!"  The monster design I guess was OK. I mean, heck its huge and its a fish, what can we expect? It's unique looking, but since we see it full body from the very beginning it loses its scariness from the get-go. It coming back after - you know, dying - was also annoying and cliche.  If you're going to watch it, watch the first half hour or so. Once the monster's shown, just turn it off. You can probably guess who lives and who dies. And since the alien survival rate in movies is very low, you can probably guess what happens to our good friend Mister Guppy 
 Time Tunnel. Great concept. So much history to draw upon. Too bad that half way through the first season the producers ran out of ideas and resorted to "aliens taking over the earth in the future" stories. I'd like to buy the first half for half price. 
 Just as a note, I picked up this book at a local used bookstore, in one of the boxes by the exit listed as "FREE." I guess that would be a sort of portent for what was to come next.  The plot is simple and almost cliche enough: ten people gathering for a 30-year college reunion. Ten different stories basically, plus one recount of a dead graduate. These people are in their early fifties, with each little story/chapter reminiscing on their lives after college graduation.  As a previous reviewer has stated, yes, the major flaw with this book that had the potential to be quite good is that all these people are being whiny, whiny, whiny. Now. Of course, everybody has their own right to be sad and whatnot, but these people seem to take it one step further. I'm gonna just get to the point and state that I absolutely abhor the women in this book (except for two). The rest, sadly, are basically just emotionless bitches in some way or another: one thinks she's 'incapable' of falling in love (and note, she was an art major, haha), another is some blonde with 2 husbands because she wants it all, another, I think, gets what she deserves after cheating on her husband. And so forth. And the men? The men, they just basically sit there, brood a little, and take this BS from the women. Not that I'm saying to go and beat the gals up, but at some point, a guy will have to realize that he was being f***ed over by this lady, true love or not, and has to move on and stop wasting precious time over what has already been done.  So if this is adulthood, or rather, being middle-aged--a bleak overview of their failed love lives so far and nothing else--then I think I'm gonna kill myself before I turn forty. The ending was simply ridiculous and not really an ending at all. The conclusion, the characters, it all just made me angry. It could be that O'Brien's intention was to pick the saddest group of lovestruck losers you've ever met to poke fun at them. But if your some heartbroken idiot who can't get over your unrequited-love situation and wish to indulge in a story that shares your pain, this is the book for you. Now, on a personal note, I've known love too, and experienced its pain, but this is just ABSURD. If your fifty, feeling sorry for yourelf, and still aching over what happened years back, stop watching Lifetime and go read up on people who REALLY suffer; our fellow humans in third-world areas and countries that practice political oppression 
 The present-day Pentagon budget, adjusted for inflation, is projected to be 23% over the average of the Cold War era.  By some calculations, the U.s. spends more than all other nations on defense, maintaining forces in several dozen countries (perhaps over 100).  Among current members of Congress, the percent of veterans is now lower than anytime since the end of WWII.  Bacevich goes on to assert that we have married a militaristic mindset in the 1990s with utopian ends, that this has been reaffirmed by 9/11 and the Global War on Terror, and that this does not serve our interests.  Probably true.  However, the vast bulk of "The New American Militarism" consists of Bacevich rambling about Weinberger, Powell, Abrams, etc., with little compelling documentation, quantification of impact, or common thread.  Bottom Line:  Boring 
 This book was okay... I too would say borrow it or check it out from the library.  It had some useful information, but what it did have was not indepth enough to really be of help, and most of it was irrelevant 
 Unfortunately, I read this book before reading the reviews.  It was in my disgust for the book, that I got online to read the reviews to see what other Christians thought.  I firmly agree with the many negative comments that have already been brought out.  This book is full of Debi Pearl's twisted opinions, but rather than be stated as that, the book uses a type of pathetic guilt to try to lead the reader to think that what she is saying is Biblical. I would not recommend this book to anyone, but those that are in a failing marriage due to physical, emotional, or verbal abuse need be very cautious of the harm that can be done if following the opinions of the Pearl's, especially where kids are involved also 
 This is Burgett's personal account in Operation Overlord. I have the greatest respect for what Screaming eagles did in Normandy, but Burgett is a prima donna and it shows 
 I'd give this product zero stars if I could.    I use the QuickBooks online payment service with version 2004, and last week it started telling me that they were discontinuing support for version 2004 with that online service, so they forced me to upgrade.  So I bought the upgrade, and when I ran the installer it wouldn't accept my serial number.  I spent forty minutes on the phone with tech support on a choppy line to India, and he still couldn't get it to work.  I finally gave up when the next step he proposed was to disable all of the services running on my computer.  I had heard from others, including an accountant, that this version was bad but couldn't believe it would really be this bad.  I'd used QB since the early-1990s and never really had a problem.  But this is really, really bad.  Intuit needs to go back to the drawing board with this version.  It's a TOTAL LEMON 
 Talk about self-absorbed...I guess the ego and the love of self this man displays are essential to success in business...I thought the man made some good points, but few are helpful to anyone in the real world (or outside  the newspaper business).  Nausea sets in after the second chapter.   Neuharth will die an old, lonely, rich man.  Respected by many, hated by  nearly all.  Luckily, I didn't have to sit through this entire book.  I put  it down quickly 
 I liked the price of this, but I guess you get what you pay for.  My friends complained that I sounded as though I were underwater.  I returned this product - a real piece of Cr*p.  
 As other have stated, the performance is excellent.  My wife and I watched this in vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the show.  With that said, my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did. They used some kind of filter on many of the shots.  They change camera angles 50 times in 1 minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch.  You do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it.  Additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music.  I have to sell my copy because I get nauseas watching it.  I hope they re-make this DVD.  I think my 7-year old daughter could do a better job editing...and we could use the additional revenue stream... 
 I strongly disliked this movie very much. It was educational, and I guess you can't criticize true stories, but the ending was terrible. It should have gone on to explain where the bodies were buried or where they were out or what happened to the rest of their extended family? I did not like this movie at all 
 Based on all the hype, I thought this book would change my life.  But it didn't.  In fact, I found it to be fairly disjointed and at times, contradictory.  There were too many perspectives and the story didn't really even have a cohesive plot.  This is the most overrated book I've read since The Da Vinci Code 
 As a volunteer at an animal shelter, this was the book to read for our book club.  I was sorely disappointed.  Although I know Mr. Foster's heart is in the right place, the start of the book begins with his observations of dogs that he didn't help - which was quite disturbing.  Additionally, I found his writing skills poor.  His lack of explanation as to why, for example, his dog was vomiting blood, left you hanging.  The book just ends, no real ending to the story.  As I said, I was very disppointed 
 I came across this movie on T.V. and was so excited that there was a sequel to Merlin, a film I thought was fabulous. I was completely wrong. This move is so flawed, I don't even know where to begin.   First off, the story in no way correlates with the first movie, except for the fact that Sam Neil and Miranda Richardson have parts in it. You could fall into the plot holes. So, Merlin leaves Camelot in the care of Arthur with the belief that everything is secure. He goes a takes a "nap"  and accidentally sleeps for 50 years. He wakes up totally confused and puzzled (which he keeps telling us over and over by stating his questions aloud). Camelot has gone way down hill. Blah, blah, blah. Enter Jack, a thief with magical abilities. It's later revealed that he is the love child of Merlin and the Lady of the Lake, played by Miranda Richardson. By the way, in this movie, the Lady is evil and resembles Queen Mab more than she did in the first film. So, Camelot is sacked by crazy wood-dwelling people, the rulers are corrupt, Merlin dies half way through, etc. Jack along with Gawain's granddaughter, her lover blacksmith, a squire named "Brian" (whose really a very masculine looking female named Brianna) go on a quest to restore the lost grail (which Arthur supposedly found earlier)and save Camelot. A great battle errupts with the crazy people, everyone dies, Jack saves them with the grail, and shacks up with a very masculine Brianna to "sow some seeds" (...enough said).   The plot is overly drawn out and boring, the characters/actors lack any depth or redeeming qualities, the writing is horrible and cheesy, and Merlin really lacks any substantial part (plus he's a bumbling idiot). This movie was a complete waste of time. There is no mention of any of the characters in the first film (i.e. Nimue, Mab, Frik, etc.) I advise any who saw the first movie...dont bother with this one 
 Got them thinnking there were plentiful and cheap.  Pros: Alot of Balls, hurt pretty bad.  Cons: Jam in Barrel of all of my guns, my friend has one gun they work in, the seems stick out a bit.  Not for me, I reccommend buying them at your local store 
 Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy Card's writing, especially his, uh, "Enderverse".  I loved Ender's Game, I absolutely adored Speaker for the Dead, I'm reading Xenocide and I love what I've read, and I liked Ender's Shadow.  I don't like Shadow of the Hegemon though.  It's nothing but boring, long and tedious talk about...politics.  Also, Card doesn't seem to understand how much the world would have changed in 200 years.  I don't know, I seem to like Card better when he's writing about philosophy, not politics 
 George Page is a journalist, not a researcher. Unfortunately, that does not save him from taking the posture of one who knows better. He dismisses whole fields of discourse with offhand remarks, for example: "Eventually behaviorism melded with the equally notorious sociobiology as formulated by E. O. Wilson." (p. 29) For an accessible yet scholarly exploration of animal cognition, I recommend Marc Hauser's "Wild Minds." Hauser is a scientist, who specializes in primate cognition. His writing is more lucid, and less affected. He addresses the same questions as Page, with an appreciation for subtle variaritions in the possible interpretations of evidence, which is lacking in Page's presentation. One comparison between the books: Page's bibliography is 3 pages long; Hauser's spans 30 
 Paul Tibbet should have been tried as a war criminal. I don't see anything to celebrate about on this 60th anniversary of the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Perhaps the Japanese are rethinking about these events today and can write their own versions of what they think of these two genicides. Whether it saved lives or not is speculation, just that speculation.  We all know how speculation is viewed in a court of law 
 I'm surprised at all the good reviews this book got. Not to be snide, I just genuinely am.   This book looms in my memory as the one book I had to drag myself to finish. A book that made me tear up with boredom. The plucky heroine wasn't likable, the names were all forced and strange (none making sense in a universe together--more like an assortment of characters from different books) , not on the unique side, really.  I thought any originality forced and unfounded, and wished it would have turned out better for me, especially as the "magic dust" theory was such a nice start.  The ending wasn't predictable, but it was trying so very hard NOT to be, it couldn't possibly have been anything but what it was: Dull.  With all these good reviews, and me not having read it in years, it might be worth trying, but I stand firm: take it out of the library 
 I love "The number one detective agency" series, and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales.  Unfortunately there was no narrative flow, making the stories stilted and un-interesting.  Maybe a narrative explaining the lessons would have helped.  I suggest this book only for those interested in collecting african fable 
 Oh man... this book was absolutely terrible. I was expecting to learn a little bit about the lives of homeless people-- you know-- all of the suffering that they endure etc., etc. Instead, what you get here is a story about a homeless man and how he works for a newspaper. He goes on and on discussing his position at the newspaper and never really elaborates on anything else. At first, I couldn't put the book down. I was patiently waiting for some intriguing stories about life as a homeless man. Then I decided to put the book down about 3/4 of the way through. I gave up. Boring, boring, boring. This book will cure anyone's insomnia-- it put me to sleep- that's for sure. ZZZzzzzzz.... 
      This book is definetly not for begginers. It has a lot of technical information that is virtually useless to to the begginer and average pet owner. I'm sure I would give it a 5 star rating if I were a breeder, but I'm not. Save your money and look for another book if you are a begginer to keeping Bettas 
 One of the Shabbiest pieces of research I've seen in my life. It is full of so much misrepresentation and frankly dishonesty that one can conclude only one of the two outcomes, either Prof. Kripal has no insight into Indian thought or he is working towards his own agenda of looking at world from his own Freudian lens 
 I was assigned this book for a graduate level substance abuse class at the seminary I attend.  I found the content quite shocking.  If you are a Christian, you should know that this book is probably not what you think.  May's theology will be strange to anyone who considers the Bible to be God's Word.  The beliefs that May lays out are a hodge-podge of Freudian psychodynamics, eastern religious traditions, Christianity, and gnosticism.   May's foundational premise is that human beings are basically good and that addictions subvert our goodness and redirect what he believes is our innate desire for God.  That is certainly contrary to the testimony of Scripture.    If you are looking for another secular humanistic treatise on addictions you will likely love this book. If you are looking for a Biblical treatment of addictions, you won't find what you are looking for here.  I would recommend Ed Welch's book, "Addictions: A Banquet in the Grave".  
 The Snub-nose Revolver could be classified as a subject in much need of discussion but with limited material available.  This is why I wanted to read this book since the snubby .38 Special or .357 Mag is a very common carry gun by licensed civilians and used as a back up by law enforcement officers.  There have been many instances cited where this type of gun saved someone's life.  There are flashes of brilliance written in this book but mostly the author loses momentum very quickly and you're wanting for more.  Another reviewer stated that this book was a compilation of "gunzine articles" and though I am not sure if it was, the book certainly could flow better.  Some examples of things I liked were the reloading of the revolver.  One pearl was that you should reload opposite the way the cylinder rotates so if you have to slap the cylinder shut and fire in a hurry the bullets that were loaded will be available to be shot.  Also his technique for aiming at just two cylinder holes versus all five or six promotes accurate and less cumbersome reloading.  The author knows the different types of snub nose revolvers and though I would have liked him to be a bit more descriptive, there are certainly examples for you to look at if you are thinking of getting one.    Some things that were big misses:  His chapter on the trigger and use of the front sight was just a tease.  There are many important factors regarding trigger control that are absolutely necessary for the snub nose revolver to shine and it is glossed over at best.  He barely mentions dry firing which is an intricate part of mastering this type of gun if you want to learn how to shoot it well.  The proper grip is very important and this is barely covered.  The small barrel of the snubby means that you need every tool available to shoot it accurately and take advantage of its close quarters capabilities and the author just doesn't take the time to discuss this.  When I tried to learn the revolver I found that I had to hold the gun with no thumb pressure or I would string laterally.  I also needed to shoot it with my strong hand gripping the gun no harder than shaking a man's hand or I would shoot low.  A shooting wheel like the one in the US Army pistol manual would really help you at the range and the snubby needs as perfect control as you can muster to hit your target, especially at distances greater than 5 yards.  You may want to look at www.sportshooter.com in the target section for this wheel.  It is free to download.  The chapter on tactics is just awful.  The author interjects examples, which do not contribute much to the points he is discussing.  It just seems to fill up paper.    The book has helpful sections, don't get me wrong, but it could have been a lot better and though it misses its mark it is nice to see a book about a very useful weapon be promoted.  The one thing I absolutely agree with the author on is that the first rule of any gunfight is to have a gun and the snub nose revolver makes that a lot easier. 
 I am kind of disappointed at this book. The illustration is dull. The words are plain.   Not very appealing for preschoolers or 1-2 graders, while it is too simple for a savvy reader. I would not recommend it for either gifts or self use. 
 I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid 
 I cant say i especially like any of the songs on this album. All of them are incredibly repetitive.   If you like aphex's repetitive stuff, buy it, otherwise buy one of his better albums, like Richard D. James or Drukq 
 I guess I was lucky enough to get my hands on a VHS copy of this movie with the original music, which did not include any Chris Isaak or K.D. Lang songs.  If this is a period movie (and it should be), then period music should be used in all the versions.  It sounds like they couldn't get legal clearance to use all of the original music for the movie, so they replaced songs like "Another Saturday Night" by Sam Cooke with a song by K.D. Lang, who was probably still in diapers in 1963.  That's where the movie took a dive for me in a big way on the DVD version and it only got worse as the movie went on.  Other songs were swapped out and music was added in scenes, like at the Carnival and the "Wild Night" scene, where the original version had no music.    Maybe if enough fans of this movie complain, MGM will blow the dust off their checkbook and pay the original artists (or their estates) to get the rights to use their music.  Some bonus features would be nice too.  The least they could do was to allow 60 Minute Man to finish playing in the credits, like it did on VHS.  If you are lucky enough to own an original VHS copy, you'll notice MGM did not run the full credits like you would normally see in a movie, which would include the music credits. 
 Wonderful prose -- use of language 
 i really try and like this lady tammylee but she is not ideal for a woman like me to try and look like, her booty is too round and seems like she has a big booty complex....she has some great moves and does some fun work, but Leisa Hart, the instuctor on several other "STEEL" videos seems more enjoyable and likable...nothing against Tammilee, but this video set didn't do it for me 
 I purchased two of these hand held Deal or No Deal games for my two 8 year old twin boys. The boys found that they had trouble indicating that they'd like to "Take the Deal".  When the pressed the button to say "Yes" to the deal, the game continued as if they said "No Deal".  They got annoyed, but kept on playing.  I tried the game, thinking that they did something wrong, but I also had the same problem.  I'm annoyed because the game was $20 each and I think it doesn't work properly! 
 This book was advertized as regarding the manslaughter and subsequent libel trials of Dr. Mary A. Dixon Jones in 1894.  Based on the advertising, I expected the book to be about the two trials, the evidence involved and  the courtroom machinations of the lawyers.  Instead, it is a tiresome  rendering of the history of gynecology, women's rights (or lack thereof),  and disagreements in the medical profession.  I found the style more  academic than popular and suggest that the author was aiming more at the  professional historian than the casual reader.  Even for the professional  historian, there is a great draught of facts surrounding the trials and  there is more information on the history of gynecology as well as unproven  speculation as to the effects of the trial on the medical community of  Brooklyn 
 Sure, this movie is a classic. But is it any good? Frankly, I found it to be tedious in the extreme.  It's certainly pleasant to look at. The sets are quite amazing, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.  The story (as described in detail in many other reviews here) has potential as both a thriller and a thought-provoking essay (ultimately it is neither).  The acting is top notch, as are all of the special effects. Those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory. In fact, all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic.  But the whole thing never rises to its premise. Its "thriller" aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line, and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN STOP THE NUKE! The resolution is an afterthought (a quick fix in the extreme), and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is (narrowly, whew!) averted. The characters are thin at best, and stock at worst.  This movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early 70s thought technology would be like in the mid 70s. Yawn. (I must laugh at the whole bell/paper bit. It means nothing to the plot, and is the ultimate contrivance.)  If a deadly virus actually came back from space, there would certainly be action on many fronts, with plenty of interesting conflict to go around. Some people would try to understand it, others would want only to kill it. There's some potentially interesting tension right there. Some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public, others would want to warn them. Again, that could have been a good source of tension. Someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon (mentioned in passing, but never developed), while others would try very hard to prevent that. More tension.  I'm just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly slow-moving scenes which it actually contains. This movie is the poster child for boring science fiction, and it would not have had to be that way.  I haven't read the book, but I bet it's a lot better. At its core, this movie is a boring dud.   
 After reading all the great reviews, I was compelled to buy this book. It just did not live up to my expectations. I really did not like this book 
 I realize that I am in the minority here, but this book did not have what Earth Song had. When I read Earth Song, I could not wait to get my hands on the final novel of this trilogy. When I read it I was very disappointed. The hero, Roland, was horrible mean throughout the story to a point that became difficult for me to stomach. In a way, I could understand why he acted the way he did because he did believe, with just cause, that his wife, Daria, was pregnant with someone else's baby. However, when Daria suffered a miscarriage, he acted downright cruel. She suffered a miscarriage saving the life of one of his friends, and when she was recovering, Roland made it apparent that he was more concerned about the guilt his friend was feeling. In fact, he physically carried her into his friends room and told her that she was going to stop being so self-centered and assuage his friends guilt. After I read this, I could not give any credibility to the fact that he ended up professing his love to Daria, and I felt that she deserved better. I realize that I was reading a medeival romance, but that does not mean that it has to have a hero who can be so cruel and mean about one of the most tragic things that can happen to a woman. If anyone wants to read a truly good medeival romance, try Castles In the Air by Christina Dodd 
 Between the "Glamour Shots & Easy Sex, Different Babys' Daddys" What else is there? Oh yeah, the many scripture quotes & abortion info.  Dont forget unprotected sex with every man she dates. Dont forget letting a strange man pick your daughter up from school. Poor Amber! This gave me insight alright, on how dysfunctional Amber Frey is. Shame on her for using Laci's photo!    I hope that she spends her profits on much needed therapy & a Tubal Ligation!   
 For people that had tryed many ways to lose weight, that book is useless because contain no new information about how to do it. The method is less food, low calories and more exercise, just it. It has a few informations that can help understand how the metabolism works. 
 I really liked the first book--A Skeleton in God's Closet--as kind of a DaVinci Code alternative.  I was really looking forward to this one, but just could not get into it.   Besides all the alcohol usage and the semi-suggestive love scenes, the main character hardly seems to be a spiritual person. (The same issues could be raised in the first book, but the plot really [...] in.)   While I agree with much of the author's eschatology, I dislike the way that he makes fun of and dismisses so many Christians who hold the popular dispensational view.  Not all dispensationalists are raving lunatics.  Many have very solid minsitries--men like John MacArthur, Chuck Swindoll, Erwin Lutzer, Joe Stowell, Woodrow Kroll, Warren Wiersbe and countless others.  It seems that the author thinks more highly of the pope than evangelcials who hold a different eschatology.  However, there is a little chart in the book that illustrates all the different millennial views.  I used it in my Sunday school class and it was very helpful.  Bottom line--just too much stuff I want to read for me to stick with this one.  Disappointed 
 As an experienced programmer looking to learn languages I do not regularly use, or asked to recommend a book to someone else for learning a new language, I look at many books. This book is bad. The author takes you by the hand and does everything for you. There aren't any exercises or review questions at the end of chapters. People don't learn that way. To learn something and keep it learned people must do something, perform an exercise, think through and solve a problem. This book isn't much better than a classroom lecture, or a TV show. This book does not make you think 
 The early part of the book was pure Ludlum, good opening, strong plot buildup, etc. The second quarter went off on a tangent of the spy hero suddenly meeting up with another spy, an old female flame, and yet another spy, a British tongue-in-cheek type.   This was followed by paragraph after paragraph of what they all once meant to each other, ad nauseam.....gaaaaaagggg. The whole story took a new direction possibly aimed at getting women to read spy thrillers.   I don't know. I don't care. The unread remains of this trivial pursuit spy scam lies buried in a wastepaper basket somewhere in my house waiting for next week's trash collection. I'm just glad I bought it second-hand. 
 Stephen King is a master of suspense, but for whatever reason he decided to leave his trademark out of this apocalyptic 'masterpiece.'  I'm not sure what all the hype is about with this novel. I found it much too long and anti-climactic. The character development is extensive and wonderful, but if I had to read about one more commitee meeting I was going to throw the book out the door. Near the book's end I was ready for them all to die just so the story would stop.   The great parts of this book were much too few and far between to justify the length. In the end I understood why his editors cut it down. I had much more fun reading Salem's Lot 
 the young actor is great in this movie, but the film itself is non-exciting and a bit boring.** 
 Music Girl Sam's review is well put.  As an actual connoisseur of music (My hd has 14,000 songs on it and my box in my basement still has 300 cds I haven't burned to my computer yet.) I'd have to say that this group is nothing more than a great high school band.  Yes their sound is more polished and studio-ized than the average garage CD, but the lyrics and the overall generic pop-rock group style like it was conjured up by someone of the maturity of a teenager.  That being said, maybe they will have a better second effort since they obviously know how to play instruments and sing.  All they need is someone to write the songs for them.    I personally fell into the trap of hearing one song, then checking the reviews on Amazon and letting that be enough.  I guess I should have known that when the New CDs are only .90 then there's probably something up.  My recommendation is to download "Statue" and skip the rest of the CD.  Most of the lyrics couldn't be more clichï¿½'d and when they aren't they sound just plain silly.  I mean check these out from  "Nikki Don't Stop" (track 11):  Hotter than a Puerto Rican mama, suckin' on ice in a sauna,  Hotter than a little cheerleader, throwin' back cheap tequila,  Hotter than a stolen rolex, hotter than late night phone sex,  Hotter than the back seat of a black jeep on a back street  If you think these lyrics either make sense or actually took an intelligent person to write them, then you still aren't tall enough to ride the rides at Kings Island.  I'd give this CD 2 stars, but because so many people gave them 5 I have to give them less to bring down the rating in attempt to save people like myself that got duped into buying this studio album.  Buy Teddy Geiger before you buy this or The Fray or Snow Patrol or virtually anything else along those lines before you waste your money on this 
 The music on this CD sounds fantastic, but BE AWARE that they are only short segments of the hymns. For example, I specifically bought the CD for "Be Thou My Vision", which is actually only a short instrumental, and "Crown Him With Many Crowns", which only had one verse. Not good for a rousing sing-along while you do the dishes 
 I admit that I'm addicted - despite the s.l.o.w. progress, constant female bickering, and frequent fashion details.  I want to see how this dang series ends...will it?    This particular installment of the Dragon et. al. left me feeling underwhelmed.  The ending was a disappointment, but I'll press on and order book 8.  
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 I was truly annoyed by his random writing style and the book's lousy layout. Look at the cover---the inside is just as chaotic. I bailed after 15 pages or so. Too bad, as  he has some good things to say, but it wasn't worth the effort. As a design advocate I'm amazed that his book designs are so ineffective and shoddy. He loves design but not graphic design?.. 
 Dear God in Heaven . What a dreary little effort this is and what a disappointment after A Simple Plan . GReat idea for a very short story. Bad idea for a novel . In the end  ( if you can finish the tome ) you'll be rooting for the plant to do its darnest and quickly  
 If this is a brilliant debut then what else  these publishers are looking at must be really abysmal!  The characters are cartoons....the writing is glib and I just kept thinking...who cares?   I am just stunned by the positive reviews and the hype and I loved Secret History by Donna Tartt.  If there were minus stars I'd give it one 
 Haven't read the book, so can't compare, but  The Relic on film is simply pathetic. Yes, it's a monster movie. The problem is, this movie is no better than most of its genre, and worse than some. The monster looks like a refugee from one of the Star Wars episodes. The acting and dialogue are terrible. What a yawner! 
 There are some writers whose books are so, well, just plain bad, awful, terrible, dreadful, etc., etc., that they're a waste of perfectly good paper.    This is so bad--  It deserves to be blamed for global warming.    
 I agree. A GOOD idea poorly thought out. YOu would have to mount it on a pole or hang it from the celing to get the desired effect. Rex is laser CRAZY and he is not into this toy. I hope they are working on a new design, maybe the mirror should rotate ?  PS. We played with it some more and found if I set it on top of the very high chest it works ok and Rex will be interested SO am bumping it up a star 
 The ideas in this book look like they came chargin out of the 80's.  I have not used it since I bought it.  This was a definite waste of money 
 Wow. Unlike most people I wasn't that worried about CN taking  a hand of the second Big 0 series. The fact that they were likely doing it for money didn't worry me in the least. I knew they would do their best to deliver a quality work and continue on with the spirit of Big O. If you liked the first season but are denying yourself the second, you are making a big mistake. Don't let Kid's review scare you away either. That is neither proven nor acknowledged as a theory for the series. It is just one possible interpatation. To set those of you that have fears at rest, I will deliver a counter-example. For everything the Kid said there is a counter example that makes the events of Paragdrim real and the ones in the first episode as false. These are spoilers for the first episode, but please read it! Especially if you read Kid's review... it is a counter to that.   SPOILERS:   1. When Roger speaks into his watch to call Big O there is nothing on his wrist but a leather band and a broken watch. (A Kid)  Counter: Yes. That is because as we speak Roger is losing faith in himself and thus Big 0 won't allow him to be his pilot. The missing watch isnt insanity. It is Freudian psychology. As a side note, the reason the fake world Roger invented looked like our world is for a variety of reasons. One of them is so that the audience can associate with it more. Another reason is so that we think Roger is insane. Roger thinks he is insane, and the makers want us to think he is too. Later, Roger realizes he isn't insane. He was just afraid! He admits that fear and then gains back his confidence. The audience then moves on and enjoys the real world of the anime. "A Kid" decided to not do that and instead set about ignoring the sequence of events, and also making giant assumptions out of absolutely nothing. For example KID: Where does the insane asylum mentioned in 5. come from? There is no reference to it either abstractly or directly in the anime! You made up the asylum, and even admitted it yourself. The asylum forms a large part of your reasoning and without it the flaws in your theory are already becoming clear. I just hope that makes watching Big 0 for the second or third time more enjoyable for you A Kid (:   2. The REAL Beck, the Bank manager, who Roger fantasizes as a criminal, points out that "this man is obviously dilusional." (A Kid)  Counter: Beck appears in the Big 0 manga. Everyone keep that in mind for the rest of what I say. Now, in the anime Roger is reading the manga. In the first episode of the second season, Roger runs into Beck. He knows who Beck is. Got that so far? Good. Later, after meeting Beck, he reads the manga that Beck is a villian in. Now how is it that a "real" bank manager appears in the manga that supposedly inspires Roger Smith with the idea of making up a pretend world? Did the bank manager give the manga makers permission to use his character for whatever reason for a vilian inside the manga? I know that is hard to understand, but read it through two or three times and it should become clear. It is already proof that A Kid was wrong in his sequence of events, as in, what happened first and what happened next.   3. Roger reads from the Big O Manga and gets the idea for his fantasy about being a negotiator and piloting Big O. (A Kid)  RIGHTTTTTTT *sarcasm*. Have you read the Big 0 manga A Kid? If Roger Smith as the Wanderer based a fake world off of the manga, then why is it that so many people in the Wanderer's World appear in the manga before he even reads it? Roger was reading about people he had met in the Wanderers World. For example, he met Beck in a bank, called him on being a criminal, and was called delusional for his trouble. He then LATER, after meeting the bank manager Beck, reads a manga that YOU (A Kid) use as evidence that says that Beck is a criminal, thus confirming what he already knew. Roger is disheartened by this because he sees it as proof that his world does not exist (which it does). A bit like this:   Wanderer Roger: Oh. It is a manga. I can use this to make my own fantasy world! (WRONG!)  Negotiator Roger: NO! It is a manga! That must mean that I really am insane! (RIGHT! BUT NOT REALLY, CAUSE HE IS RIGHT AND THE MANGA IS WRONG. It is just what Roger thinks).   Want another example? Roger calls out Dorothy's name as the human Dorothy walks into the Nightengale, but Dorothy appears in the manga that Roger reads afterwards. How can Roger be living in a real world with a manga inspired off people that exist in his world?   4. By the time Angel comes to pick him up in the car Roger has already returned to his fantasy world and nothing that occurs from that point on is real anymore for the rest of the series (I think). (A Kid)  You think wrong. You don't think on a psychodynamic level do you? Roger is being driven by conscious and unconscious forces, okay? Get that through your head, it is crucial. Roger is losing confidence in himself and unconscious forces within himself are helping him do just that. LOSING CONFIDENCE. At the same time, we, the audience, are supposed to lose confidence with him. The next step is admitting that we were wrong and that Roger is sane. You just decided not to do that. Again, you just jumped around filling in holes and making the "crazy" theory where there was none.   5. Roger sees himself driving the car while he is in the back seat, a halucination that has been known to have been played out by schitzos. (A Kid)  This is basically the first thing you said that has any bearing whatsoever. It isn't enough though. While what you said about schitzos is true, it isn't enough to condemn Roger as one. Rather, Roger was trying to make himself (and by extension, us) think that he was schitzo. A person losing faith in themselves does what their intuition tells them. Try to lose it faster! That was what Roger did. Eventually, he had to face the facts. Roger the Negotiator was real, Big 0 was real, and he needed to master his fear and move on and embrace the uncertain future.   A Kid - A Kid, your problem was that you put way too much stock inside one episode. After that you mixed around the sequence of events. You make it sound like Roger read the manga and then met everybody inside it. That isn't impossible. A Kid, you need to pay more attention to the other episodes! Especially the last one.   Roger talks about how Memory helps people find out who they are.  At the end, Roger starts remembering who he is by examing his past. At the end of the series, Roger claims he doesn't know exactly who he is. He starts Remembering everything from start to finish because he wants to get a bearing on that. That is the end of Big 0! He is using Memory to help find out who he is now compared to what he was then. His experiences (with Dorothy and Angel) have changed him a lot. Notice that the fact that he is insane doesn't even enter his head once. He got over it. You should too.   Roger the Wandederer is the fake. Roger the Negotiator is real. Roger has a lapse, that lapse made him think he was insane and he lost confidence. That was when he was Wandering. He later realized (thanks to memories of the real Android Dorothy, for whom he feels affection) that The Negotiator was real and the Wandederer was just the guy who was afraid.   A Kid. The chances of you reading this a year later are tough. Still, I got to press you. You seem smart. Watch the series again and look out for the things I said. Namely the first episode. As for everyone else. Take what I have said to heart or at least to thought.   A Kid's Theory about Roger being crazy: It has no ground. A Kid messed up the order of events in the first episode, ignored the rest of the series, and then made a whole bunch of assumptions that have no factual proof whatsoever. There is no asylum, there is no Wanderer. That was Roger losing faith. He regained the faith in himself and remembered he was the Negotiator. Read everything I said again if you are still confused. It is important that you understand.  A Kid makes you think the first episode is the only real episode. That is wrong. It is the fake episode, and that episode that is a review! Come on everyone! Think! The first episode of the second season is just a review on everything that happened in the first season of the anime! You have little retake episodes like that in every anime series you watch! Think! THe Big O crew wasn't satisifed with just making a recap epsisode though. They made it like it was so that they could mess with our heads. A Kid took a small ball, ran with it, and tried to make it into something it is not. He ignored the order and made very large assumptions where there are none. If you research a round a little, you'll find out that what I said is true.   Conclusion: Roger the Wandererer is the Roger Smith who is fake. He is the lost faith Roger. Roger the Negoitator is the Roger who regains faith.  Rent or Buy?  BUY OF COURSE.           
 I received the wrong item, a videotape and emailed the address of the company that didn't send the book I ordered, but they didn't reply to my email. I tried to email Amazon about it, but ran into snags: your system wasn't working, etc. I finally had to take the book out of a college library, since it is out of print 
 Lynd's brand of socialism has been shown by history to be a fraud and a failure.  Capitalism has made possible the greatest and most widespread prosperity in the history of humankind.  Capitalism unleashed the productive power of technology and stimulated Silicon Valley. Lynd and his crew are wholly ignorant of science and where it is leading us.  Their patron saint, Marx, did not and could not predict the impact of science on the world.  When 78 year olds chat on the Net with ease a revolution has occurred and Marxists had no clue about it. Americans are happier and better off then ever.  Lynd fails to persuade because nobody in America wants his REVOLUTION.  Lynd's utopia is everybody else's prison 
 I was more than disappointed in this book. I bought it because it said "Edgar Cayce" on Soulmates, but in reality it is Kevin J. Todeschi on Soulmates.  I love to read Edgar Cayce's readings because of the truths it contains, the wisdom, so much said in so little words... his readings don't confuse me (like many psyhoclogy books do) but help me define what it is I already know... but very few readings were in the book - it was mostly Kevin J. Todeschi. 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 A daily task or 365 ways to save money works if you can stay focused that long. Yet, this is life and one person saying they can do it doesn't alway work for other peoples money.  Specifics other than an author saying me,  me, me all the time is how I have learned to invest 
 Stunningly bad, Die Another Day is an incomprehensible bucket of slops with a script written by a roomful of 12 year olds and directed by a gross incompetent. It takes a lot to make Madonna look like a shop window mannequin, but this film does it. It appears to be about diamonds, or North Koreans, or Cuba, or something. Look elsewhere 
 I found this book horribly written. For any amazing president who helped to mold our nation, this author certainly did not portray Madison this way. I've read a number of books about other historical figure that all managed to capture the time and person, but this one did not. The only people who will probably pore over this book with slight interest will be the students that have assigned for class 
 I am a stay-at-home mom looking for simple - yet unique - ways to say "thank you, congratulations, I'm sorry ..." to various people.  This book devotes much of its pages to business-related writing, which I no longer need.  While I have found a few nuggets of inspiration here and there, I am not particularly inspired by her suggestions of using, "I love it!" for a thank you note or "thinking of you" for a sympathy card.  I could probably have come up with those on my own 
 All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over.  
 A collection of essays covering all periods of modern war as well as essays on the development of the different aspects of war, ie Navy, Army, Air Force. Being a casual reader with just a light interest in history, the book was far to detailed and at times quite difficult to read. This book is not an introducton to the subject and so I would only recommend this book to someone with previous knowledge of the subject and a very keen interest 
 The editorial says this book, which assumes you have alredy read Audel Machine Shop Basics, will tell you all you need to know, but it falls far short of the mark.  The book attempts to cover all machine operations, but fails to provide sufficient diagrams and detailed descriptions for all the operations.  I will have to buy additional books in order to fill the gaps left by this author.  I would still buy it if, for example, you already know how to set up a lathe to bore the inside of a hole and just need to know the appropriate cutting speeds and want a reminder of relevant machinist tips and tricks.  It is also one of the few books on the subject available as an eBook for immediate download.  If however, you can wait a day for the delivery of a paperback, choose something else 
 Heavyweights was a quite a disappointment, considering the presence of Ben Stiller. The movie sheds light on a popular summer camp for fat children that unexpectedly finds itself under different management.  The new administration will make it clear very soon that some major changes are to take place...   The plot and the acting are surprisingly (!) average, while the humor and the dialogues are below average.   Ben Stiller's character, a cross between Zoolander and Dodgeball (both being AMAZING movies), was unexpectedly plain and bland. As for the rest of the cast, this film does not seem to be their thing.   Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. 
 I am an avid reader and could not make it through this book. His other books were so good. I could not have predicted what a disapointment this book would turn out to be. In applying some of the recommended techniques, my 11 year old daughter, Emily, thought I lost my mind. Thank goodness things are back to normal. We are both much healthier having now dispensed with the advice 
 You can hear from the Windows Media samples that the tracks have been filtered to death.  A much more vibrant transcription of the same recordings is the wonderful "King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band: The Complete Set" 
 I have to say I am a huge PKD fan, and have read just about all of his books.  And before you dismiss this review, know that I read and enjoyed Valis and The Divine Invasion, precursors to this book, the third in the series.  But, sadly, this book just was not the vintage Dick classic that Ubik, or A Scanner Darkly was.  In fact, I was disgusted with this book, and to date, I have loved every one of Dick's books, even the more obscure ones (Galactic Pot Healer).  Though Ubik and my personal favorite Now Wait For Last Year had a strong, cohesive plot littered with welcome digressions and departures, I can't help thinking that Transmigration was just one long digression lacking any sort of structure, and without the strong and interesting characters in Dick's other books.  With a slew of obscure references to various operas, epic poems, and other pieces of the impotent intellectual vangaurd, it seemed Dick was trying to prove to us his cultural superiority and sophistication.  And that is not the Philip K. Dick I know and admire.  I suppose if you feel compelled to read everything that Dick has written, then read this, but do yourself a favor and borrow it because it is not a book that you will want to re-read 
 I only like one song on this cd. . . .The rest I believe are definitly not worth your money 
 The lead actors in this movie (Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger)were pretty flat and unconvincing, namely in the lines where they are trying to sound empathetic and concerned. The paper mache cow he was beating seemed pretty unconvincing, too. The movie is, simply enough, about a dual-personality character who has conflict with himself, and that's the most of it. More could have been done with it. More, and better 
 I loathed this book. I despised it. While every eighth grade English teacher in the U.S. may hate that I say this, I'm only telling the truth. There are characters that are so cocky and reading about them made me want to gag. Tom Sawyer as a boy and as a character seemed both annoying as a real human, and unrealistic. Becky, too, was unbelievable. No young children such as those could possibly act like that, and besides, I don't truly believe a boy Tom's age would be so cool in a cave, and rescue his lady-love.  Tom Sawyer and I just didn't get along. It's just one of those things. I suffered through reading it, though perhaps someday I'll try again, and the experience will be better 
 Englishman Tony Judt's POSTWAR is an ambitious and worthwhile undertaking: to give a coherent account of the history of Europe from 1945. The outline of events is well known: a continent in ruins at the end of the Second World War, the miraculous rise of Western Europe from the wreckage, the concurrent enslavement of the East, and thence the titanic struggle between the two world systems, culminating in the triumph of liberal democracy over totalitarian state control. It is a great story, surely one of the finest chapters in the history of human civilization.  Judt seems to take the view (with which most people would likely agree) that great shifts in history ultimately rest upon the underlying economics. In the big picture, Communism failed because it was unproductive, capitalism succeeded because it was the opposite. The question he asks is a good one: why did it happen when it did? Why, after having survived so long (since 1917, in the case of the Soviets) did the Eastern Block suddenly collapse at the end of the eighties, and so rapidly?   His answer is, astonishingly, the Helsinki Accords. "Against all expectation," he claims, "it [Brezhnev's signing of the Helsinki Accords] was to prove mortal." (p. 503). The argument here seems to be that by having agreed to the Helsinki Accords (which included some boilerplate language on human rights), the Communist leaders were thereafter hamstrung in suppressing those dissidents who dressed their opposition in terms of human rights rather than as political attacks against the Party.  He thus attributes the collapse of Communism to the role of dissenters within the non-Soviet Eastern Block countries. Judt seems not to have grasped that these countries were just the playing field, not the actual players. He refers to himself as having been in Czechoslovakia at this time; perhaps this is why he seems to think that the minor protest groups within the Soviet satellites were something other than marginal--as causal agents rather than benefactors of larger forces. In this book, Vaclav Havel plays a far greater role than Ronald Reagan in the collapse of Communism. In fact the name "Reagan" itself only appears a dozen or so times--in other words, it is rarely cited, and then usually in the off-hand manner with which those who wish they had influence dismiss those who do. (Reagan's speech at the Berlin Wall is not even mentioned, something hard to fathom in an 800-page history of postwar Europe.)  Eventually, the anti-American streak which runs through this book from the beginning emerges into plain sight: "But it should not be concluded...that it was American encouragement or support which precipitated or facilitated their [Eastern Europe's] liberation." (p. 631) and then later, equally bluntly, "...[despite] the self-congratulatory narrative that has entered the American public record, Washington did not `bring down' Communism, Communism imploded of its own accord." (p. 659.)  Really? Who would have thought that forty years of American effort in the Cold War was just a waste of time?  This proposition is such obvious nonsense that it really does not need to be argued against, but the wonder is that someone who appears to understand the function of economics in history can fail to appreciate the central role of America, and specifically of the American taxpayer, in postwar Europe. America paid for Europe's reconstruction (Marshall Plan). America paid for Europe's welfare states (by relieving their governments of the need to pay for their own defense, and also in the form of endless credits and loans). America paid for Europe's economic prosperity (by bankrolling the agencies which funded it--such as the IMF & World Bank--and by opening American markets to European goods while allowing European markets to remain subsidized and protected; something that is still the case today, from agriculture to Airbus). And finally, it was America who paid for the Soviet's defeat. Without America, modern Europe would not exist.  Yes, it is undeniable that Communism rotted from the inside. But rot by itself does not cause collapse (otherwise how to explain North Korea, a long-bankrupt thugocracy that survived even the death of the former thug-in-chief?) Such states continue to exist indefinitely, until given a push. And so to answer Judt's own question: the reason Communism collapsed when it did was because America pushed. Ronald Reagan reversed American policy and stood up to the Soviets, and did so at a time when the major Western European states were cowering in postures of supplication and appeasement (Thatcher's UK excepted). It had nothing to do with the Helsinki Accords.  Judt flatters himself in the preface that his book will be controversial, but to this reader his conclusions are too silly to be worthy of controversy. They are simply wrong.  It is a pity Judt fails here. The fundamental lesson to be drawn from the history of postwar Europe is that it is no good trying to make friends with the schoolyard bully--or to give him your lunch money in order not to get beaten up (the European response). The lesson is that you must stand up to bullies. Appeasement in all its guises--rapprochement, Ostpolitik, engagement, detente, Nixon/Kissinger-style scheming, or Carter's endless vacillation--inevitably leads to failure. And when the bill finally comes due, as it always does, then the accrued interest can be enormously costly in human life. This was true in Munich in 1938, and it remains true today.   Given the current state of the world, we could have used a book which reminded us of this basic truth right now.  There are numerous errors and omissions, mostly minor (Iceland is missing from the cover maps), occasionally more significant (For example, there is no understanding that the repeated attacks by American hedge funds against the weak European currencies did much more than just blow England and Italy out of the ERM in 1992. They also forced a hugely embarrassing French devaluation in 1993--in the form of widened intervention bands--and imposed a hitherto unknown market rigor upon the respective governments, basically requiring them to depoliticize monetary policy and rein in fiscal policy--major changes in how these governments governed. The attacks also contributed to the ready adoption of the Euro, as a collective defense against George Soros.) But any book of this scope will contain errors and omissions; in fact the strength of POSTWAR is its vast collection of facts and figures and statistics (although weakened by the lack of source citations.) It is in the small-scale work of collecting data that Judt succeeds. It is in the big-scale work of interpreting those data that he fails. For example, toward the end of the book there is an account of the disaster in the Balkans following the break up of Yugoslavia. Judt correctly identifies the nadir of postwar Europe: the slaughter at Srebrenica, in which 7400 Muslims were murdered under the noses of Dutch soldiers serving under UN command. He then goes on to contrast the situation when NATO took over, at which point the slaughters promptly stopped, and ten years of peace ensued (enduring to this day). Surely this is something to which you would ask: Why? The answer is simple: the UN force, as is usual with UN forces, was too small, had a weak and compromised mandate, was composed of soldiers who were inadequately equipped and commanded, and who operated under unrealistic rules of engagement. But the NATO force tolerated no nonsense, they came in with the intention of standing up to the Serbs, and had the ROE to do it. The Serb `army' (if thugs who slaughter civilians can be dignified with such a term) promptly collapsed.  Same lesson: bullies must be stood up to. Perhaps it is the fact that the force was American-led which prevented Judt from seeing this.  (At the time of writing, the UN is once again dithering in the same old way on the same old issue--this time in Lebanon and Darfur--a perfect example of why we should learn from the past instead of repeating it, as seems all but inevitable right now. What a sorry institution the UN has become!)  Judt gives some good detail of postwar political theory on the continent--something usually missing from English-language accounts, other than the obvious observation that such theory was mainly Marxist. Sartre and Camus were predictable, Foucault less so (a substantial presence in France, but more or less unknown in America). Judt appears to come from the political left himself, but nevertheless he seems not to have understood the basis of Foucault (which can be summed up, Deep Throat-like, as "follow the power.") In Foucaultian terms, the discourse of dissent (which Judt claims collapsed Communism) was something entirely dictated by the power relations existing at the time. He would have said look not at the surface, look at the constellations (a favorite Foucaultian term) of power. Any objective survey of the constellations of power existing in Europe in 1989 would center on the United States (and might still do so today, despite a united Germany, an expanded EU, and the absence of the Soviet threat.) In explaining the collapse of Communism, historical roads as diverse as euro-Marxism, macroï¿½-economics, empirical rationalism or even Great Man theory all lead to the same place: America. But according to Judt, Washington had nothing to do with it.  By the final chapters, any pretense of objectivity has been lost. 9/11 was not a watershed horror for the free world, but a passing American event that by implication the US deserved for its Middle Eastern policy. (Of all European leaders since 1945, Judt reserves his strongest denunciation not for Stalin or Tito or Ceausescu, but for Tony Blair. Why? Blair supports American policy--"blindly," of course.) In summing up what (Judt thinks) binds Europeans together, it is "...contrast with `the American' way of life.' (p. 748)  Lastly, not just the content but the style is likely to be tiresome to American readers. There is an overabundance of smug English circumlocutions and double-negatives: "It was not for nothing," "not perhaps terribly," and the like. Meaningless modifiers, such as "more than a little" and "decidedly," are used ad nauseum, so that the text sometimes reads like a student essay in which the author has tried padding it out to make the required number or words. Judt could learn from the great English historians of the past, of whom there are plenty, from Gibbon to Churchill. There is in POSTWAR none of their directness of language, that firm relentless empiricism which at its best ascends into epic prose, noble in conception and majestic in scope. It is what makes reading them such a pleasure, whatever they have to say. Reading Judt is just a chore.  In the end this book, for all its size, is just a sour little pamphlet--an insult to the achievement that it purports to explain. It is the written equivalent of those old photographs of Soviet leaders gathered atop Lenin's Tomb on May Day, in which the images of the purged party members have been carefully airbrushed out--except that in POSTWAR, it is not just a party hack but the main player who is missing. POSTWAR is not even bad history, it is non-history, just anti-American propaganda dressed up as scholarship.  It should sell well in France. 
 I actually developed my Palm application in Java with the Palm CDK and JUMP2.  As mentioned in earlier reviews, this book is directed to C/C++ programmers using either CodeWarrior and GCC.  I also found the information on Palm databases to be pretty shallow.  In most cases the examples were pretty shallow and certainly did not provide too much insight on how the records on the desktop are sync'ed to the handheld.  Even less was covered on how you might pull content via a web service or xml/http to the desktop.  Need an example of where this book falls short...  How do I create a .pdb file on my desktop 
 I don't want to say if this is a good, or bad CD.  I will just say that if you're looking for more song that sounds like Picking Up the Pieces...there are NONE.  I would recomend downloading the song for 99 cents somewhere 
 Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.  I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.          
 I rented this film immediatley after seeing the first Bride with White Hair hoping for a fluid and entrancing continuation of the story.  There was a perfect setup for a sequel and I couldn't wait to watch it unfold.  After the first half an hour I knew that director Ronnie Yu had abandoned the feel of the first film and it seemed he didn't really give a damn about how interesting the story was.  Poor dialogue, inadequate story, there was nothing satisfying or even interesting in this film.  If you enjoyed the first BWWH you'll probably still be tempted to watch this movie just make sure you rent it before buying 
 This memoir was painful.  Painful in a "oh my God, could it get any worse?".    Boring, mundane, cold, flatlined.  It feels as though the author is emotionless and it got to a point where I just felt like shaking her and saying "oh enough already".    Sincerely, just pass this one buy.  Not even worth a library visit.  
 Chiarella looks so far down his nose you'd think he was Pinocchio. Some good ideas buried pretty deeply in the bloated monologue. I learned very little I didn't already learn from more general books on writing that had a single chapter on dialogue.   The man curses some very four letter words and brags about how he did it as a kid. He says to listen to others for book ideas. He hasn't a clue about modern block-busters we want to write. I have about twenty books on writing, and no good one on dialog yet.  The author is indeed high in his ivory tower looking down on his ignorant students. He is a teacher, not an author. He has written a book of short stories (no reprints is my guess) and several short stories for various magazines. Come on, this is the lowest rung of professional writers.  Boo for Chiarella and Boo to Story Press 
 I normally like warm, sensual-type perfumes, but I wanted to try something different for a change.  I liked the fact that this is advertised as subtle and not perfumey.  Well...I have to disagree.  I think it is VERY perfumey and not subtle at all. To me it has a very sharp, high-toned scent which is almost acrid. I thought at first that maybe I had sprayed too much on, so I tried just a little spritz.  Still VERY strong and sharp. And I agree with the comparison to dead flowers and dryer sheets.  I will definitely not be ordering this again.  
 Listen to this CD, then listen to anything off "Double-Wide". Notice anything new? Didn't think so.  Yes, the Unc has a good sense of tone and his rhythms evoke the roots of folk, country and R&B simultaneously, for which something must be said. That something comprise my two stars.  In fact, he'd be wonderful if he'd just stop singing.  Indeed, he gets no reward for badgering my aural nerves with "Memphis Soul Song." This annoying detritus is a lot like the movie adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel "Beloved" in that there are so many places it could, and should, end. But NO, it drags on... and on... and ON!   And please, enough with the "Sophisticated Country Boy" routine. Kid Rock tried that, had his moments, and now where is the Kid? He's making the cover of the Onion. That's not necessarily a good career move. 
 With all respect to Mr. Hawking - this book should never been published. I'm not blaming him, but all others who are responsible it went to market.  Let me explain a little bit  Most of buyers of this book, are buying based on Hawking reputation from "Brief history of time" (which is excellent book). What we have here - pictures which doesn't have any relation with text (at least not valuable and are far to big - taking space in other words, you'll not buy book of 60 pages for 35 USD), changing from one subject to another, explaining the basic things somebody who is reading such a book should already know (spin - 2 pages) and then jumping to complicated things (M-theory - mentioned in 1 row) without explanation. Some jokes and comments I don't understand.  I bought this book 6 months age and came to approx 1/3 of book (poker between Hawking, Newton and I think Einstein). I didn't have nerves to read more ... this is first book in my life I didn't finish.  I never thought I'll write review, especially not like this and especially not for book of Mr. Hawking, but I felt cheated. There are so many other excellent books on same thematic, try them, forget this one.  But anyway, my 3 year old son was extremely happy by disintegrating this book to more then 1000 small pages ... lucky him.   
 Has true crime writing gotten so bad that this hack book gets 4 stars? Are these Corey Mitchell's friends and family writing reviews here? I'm sorry, but Mitchell cannot write his way out of a paper bag. Here's a verbatim example: "Downtown San Luis Obispo is located only seventeen miles from the Pacific Ocean and decorated with such gorgeous beaches as Shell Beach, Pismo Beach, and Avila Beach." Try to parse that. Lots of clumsy sophomoric duds to be found here. I ended up flipping through this very noncompelling book, got to the end and said "so what"? By the way, the book is billed as "a shocking account of rape, torture, and murder".  There's really no torture documented here - that's just lurid hype to lure in the gawking voyeur. I guess I am one, heh. I feel cheated by these reviews on Amazon. How misleading! Avoid 
 I'm not Catholic, but I was interested in learning about any evidence disproves the theories set forth in The DaVinci Code,so that I would understand their opposition to the book.   I thought this book would give me an objective view of the historic facts that The Davinci Code was based on, instead, it denied the theories using mostly beliefs as their supporting evidence.    I was disappointed because I had a hard time learning, from an academic perspective, why the Catholic church might have been falsely represented in this book 
 i was so excited to read this book as i adore the gorgeous syd.but this book was a big disappointment. 
 This is something that any first year business student could have written. It is a fast read but it provides no new insights 
 Being an avid Hollywood historian, I was eager to get this book about the history of Hollywood.  While the writing is fast paced, and the author has a keen interest in history, I cannot stop finding mistakes that make me question the writer's committment to research:  Fatty Arbuckle, for instance, was involved in a scandal at the St. Francis Hotel, not the Palace Hotel in San Francisco as reported here (and EVERY biography of Arbuckle mentions the St. Francis).  The Alhambra (in the Valentino part) is in Granada, not Seville, Spain.  Most historians believe William Desmond Taylor was gay, not "romancing both Mabel Normand and Mary Miles Mintner at the same time".  Not to mention numerous typos that any self-respecting editor would have caught.  This turns me off 
 Teri Hatcher is one of my favorite actresses. I think she is honest, and charming. But this book reveals too much about her insecurities and inadequacies at age 40. It has funny life stories mixed in, but the rest is just an account of how inadqeuate she feels and has always felt. Its sad. I think those thoughts would be better shared with a therapist. 
 The only good thing about this book is the seaside atmosphere. The seaside restaurants were enjoyable. The storyline was acceptable but not my favorite 
 The main disappointment with this movie was the excessive number of shots of the cars zipping through empty roads as compared to the number of points won by mowing down citizens. Actually not that many of the latter - the satire (such as it is) could have been much sharper and more extravagant here. Did the Director feel that stepping up that side of it would be too shocking?   Otherwise the movie has an agreeable facile sense of the period (bad hair styles, would-be funky music, absurd sets, inane plot, cheapo design all round). So worth a watch. But not the witty classic I had expected 
 This is without a doubt the worst reference on typography that I have ever read. It is filled with useless metaphors and examples. I really expected more from the Adobe Press 
 Does not come with the CD as stated.  Emailed the manufacturer and never got a response back 
 I guess we can thank the global population for making Rob Schneider a  leading actor by continually buying tickets to that Deuce Bigalow fiasco.  I could only sit through about thirty minutes of that before my head started to hurt and my eyes started to burn.  I guess I have sheer boredom or desperation to thank for actually watching this abysmal feature about a thief who finds a magical earring, which transforms him into a blonde teenager overnight.  This body transforming-opposite sex switcharoo has been done time and time again, but not this badly.  If the dwarf size Schneider makes you laugh because he looks like he's been on a narcotics binge for months on end, you might like this film.  I can cut the guy some slack because the script is so horrible that it would be hard for Lawrence Olivier to be convincing.    The majority of scenes intended to make you laugh are physical bits that aren't remotely funny.  Girls having pillow fights where Schneider overpowers them and sends them flying through the air with each blow (literally), the standard overweight character that dances sexy even though it's the most vile thing you've ever seen.  Schneider falling down bleachers, smashing his face against every seat, a cross dressing eight-year-old boy...  Adam Sandler has been stealing money for years because this same movie going public has made him a superstar.  He makes a cameo, talks so low you can't understand a word he's saying and wears quite possibly the worst wardrobe ever assembled by a costume designer.  Two things make this film at least worth watching if you're as mind numbingly bored and desperate as I was last night:  1)  Whoever the Foley Artist was for this film should never work again.  Pillows making contact, Schneider falling down, rear end slapping..it's all the same sound.  It's exactly like someone stood on a third story balcony and dropped a suitcase full of bowling balls onto the street below.  (2) Anna Faris...I can't decide whether I think she's really cute or if she's just a Plain Jane with large eyes...but when I'M thinking she's pretty cute, she's nice to look at.  
 My father had viewed this years ago and remembered it being excellent. We just got it and it is not. The sets are horrible. It must have been filmed with a budget of about $1,000 or less! The camera quality is horrible and the actors are pretty bad except for Hawkeye, Cora and Alice. The Indians are terrible. Uncas is a little nerd with an English aristocratic accent and Magua is pretty dumb too. All in all it is pretty bad. The Massacre at Fort William Henry consists of about 5 women! Would not recomend, unless you want to laugh at something very dumb. 
 I was expecting a lot from this book, and I certainly walked away feeling disappointed.  Jayna Davis comes off as something of a literal Michael Moore for the right here.  I say that because much like Moore used his film to ambiguously blame the 9/11 attacks on Saudi Arabia, Ms. Davis seems to be insinuating that Saddam Hussein was responsible for this attack.    First, yes, there is much more to this story than has been told to us.  John Doe number 2 is a legit question and the evidence does seem to indicate that he may have been a former Iraqi who was brought over to America by the first President Bush (along with many others).  But that does not mean that he, or anyone involved in the bombing, was funded or linked to Saddam (or Al Qaeda).    A things to take into consideration: I've read a few of the previous reviews that seem to indicate that because there are endorsements from former CIA director R. James Woolsey and Reagan DOD official Frank Gaffney, this makes the book completely legit.  Not quite.  Woolsey and Gaffney have become two of the loudest underground neoconservative voices of the last few years.  Woolsey also endorsed "A Study of Revenge" which pins the first WTC bombing on Hussein.  Clearly, he's more interested in justifying the war started by his peers than helping the American people find the truth.   Further, since these are two people who have the ears of the White House (especially the VP), why wouldn't this have been used to justify the second Gulf War if the evidence is so strong linking Saddam to this attack??  It certainly would have helped make the case, and given the American people a solid reason for taking the man out.  Considering that this adminstration has no problem playing fast and loose with the facts, I would imagine they would have run with this premise, even if they have minor doubts.    Personally, I don't believe Saddam had the ability to pull something like this off.  Throughout the 90's he was heavily contained and monitored.  I can't see him pulling off an attack like this (or the first WTC).    Still, this book raises some important questions that remain unanswered to this day.  And those questions should continue to be asked, just as many questions about 9/11 persist.  But raving endorsements from Glenn Beck, Woolsey and Gaffney actually hurt the credibility of this book rather than help it. 
 This is the longest 466 page book that I have ever read.  The the Holy Bible is a quicker read. It was the first Peter Robinson book that I've read and undoubtedly the last.  Stephen King must have been paied handsomly to sing the praises of the Alan Banks series.  I can't believe that a book of this calibur was even publised in such an overloaded genre. In the words of Simon Cowell, "this book was absolutly deadfull.&quot 
 I did not enjoy reading the book, A Gathering of Days. The entire book uses odd phrasology that detracts from the overall effect of the story. The word choices throughout the book make it very difficult to read and understand. The story is fine in and of itself but I was unable to enjoy the story because of the heavy word usage and poor sentence structures 
 This product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs. The tech support emailed that any CD or DVD copy software had to be removed. I guess that sort of makes a DVD or CD R/W drive rather pointless. I removed the copy software and still have bad results. About 1 out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it.  Maybe it doesn't like my corporate virus protection. I find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky. I rate this product as totally useless. 
 Yes, this book "tells it like it is"- but only for the WORST case scenarios.  Since circumstances and situations are different in every divorce, harsh reality is not always applicable- and I think this can feed into fears and worries that don't even exist in many cases.  When I was [...] and my parents divorced (25 years ago), I was given this book by a well-meaning counselor.  For a sensitive and imaginative child, already upset and grieving a former family life- this book not only can reaffirm many baseless fears, but give a whole new batch of them to worry about- such as boarding schools and foster homes. Another especially disturbing chapter discusses ways to find out if your parent doesn't love you- kids can see things in different ways and this chapter is VERY dangerous in my opinion! I feel that the only way that this book would be alright is for a parent to read it first, and then read with a child and explained in the context of their situation.  There have to be better, more timely books out there 
 In my opinion this book deal with the surface of a real basic concept in Jazz improvisation. Unfortunately the triadic concepte is here  explained through really weak and cheap examples: there are few good lines transcripted from guitar masters but Fewell's example are for the most terrible! 
 A friend recommended this book to me when I became pregnant.  I really cannot recommend anybody to buy this book if you want to get a realistic idea of what pregnancy is going to be.  If you follow her advice to not work out anymore and eat for two, yes, you will indeed outgrow your husbands cloths.  That was actually the end of reading for me 
 While beautiful this book was a disappointment and and the title misleading. We are sending it back.It is limited to cardboard puzzles, many of which are a "dime a dozen". The most highly valued, most  complicated and sought after puzzles,  solid wood and plywoood, are not  included 
 Though this book pretends to show all sides fairly, it's extremely biased against evolution (and poorly researched on that side too).  A quick look at the positive reviews here will show you that they are from people who are on the ID/Creation side.  It's a waste of time and paper, unless you just want to make yourself feel good about believing in ID/Creation 
 From about the second page of this book, I was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it. The characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another. Add to that the stereotypical characters (the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys, the women are all "large-assed" or fat with the exception of Ella).  And the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters' sexual proclivities was so completely dumb, not to mention kind of repulsive (I like a good sex scene as much as the next person, but Tuck's descriptions are completely banal).  Oh wait, there's more. The Spanish is ATROCIOUS. It's hard to believe that Tuck had a translator for this book. It's pretty clear that whoever copy edited it neither reads nor writes nor speaks Spanish. Half the names are grammatically incorrect. Many of the words are just plain wrong ("vita" means life in Italian, not Spanish, for starters). I felt embarrased for the author. Does she know that her book is full of errors? The one word that comes to mind when thinking about this book is: SHALLOW. I sincerely hope that readers don't mistake this book for historical fiction. The author clearly knows little about Paraguay and its people and history, and clearly doesn't care, from her superficial treatment of it. 
 Bette Midler and Woody Allen together would make one think of a movie that is very funny and pleasing. Instead here we get one that has more romance and drama than comedy as Bette and Woody play a couple who is celebrating their wedding annivesary as their children have both left for school. They also discover that they have been cheating on one another. The movie gets boring rather fast as Bette and Woody are the only ones we get to see as there are very few supporting characters. I would have expected better from these two 
 DO NOT BUY THIS TV, I BOUGHT IT IN FEBRUARY AND IT HAS A LOT OF BACKLIGHT BLEEDING ALL OVER THE SCREEN THIS IS TERRIBLE, I CALLED SONY THEY HAD TECHNICIANS COME OVER TO MY HOUSE THEY SAY THIS IS NORMAL, THEY REFUSE TO FIX OR REPLACE THE TV AFTER I SPENT $2,500 ON THIS SET IM SO DISSAPOINTED AND FEEL ROBBED! 
 Didn't agree with me.  I could not listen to one of these tracks all the way through. Had to hit the "Seek" button to get out of each one. Maybe I am not a true jazz lover.  There were lots of dissonant sounds and, to me, just plain noise added with whistles and odd instruments.  I was so disappointed I returned it to Amazon and did not even open the other two CDs in this series that I had also ordered.  Great cover photos and concepts but based on this CD I am staying away from this series. The jazz series I love is put out by Denon, also available on Amazon. Two that I love are "The most relaxing Jazz Standards in the universe"  and  "The most relaxing Romantic Jazz".   
 Sad to say... this story is totally believable (good things since it's a TRUE CRIME story). But it still shocks me that the "Englishers" are so ready to believe the Amish are incapable of commiting such crimes and that Amish are so ready to look past everything a "member" does 
 I have been very disappointed in this 5th Cape Light Novel. It is slow and boring. I am usually a VERY fast reader but it has taken me 4 weeks and I am still not finished with this one! I loved the first 4 books in this series but I think it is time  to finish the series and be done with it. James is not a very interesting character and NOT hero material. While I have been wondering at Leigh's past, there hasn't been enough mystery to capture my attention for very long. Emily and Dan's marriage plans are boring also. About the only interesting thing that has happened yet is Jessica and Sam's child issues. I have found myself skipping parts and that says a lot for this book. Overall, the first 4 books in this series deserve 5 stars and this one....well...you should quit while you're ahead. 
 I just have to note that I think this is Shakespeare's worst play.  It has an aweful ending , and I don't think this should even be performed.  Yet it somehow manages to make it on stage all the time and audiences still seem to want to see a girl forgive her lover after WATCHING him rape someone else on stage!  Still, if that's the kind of thing you look for in a comedy...  My opinion: if you want a play with some nice healthy cross-dressing, go buy As You Like It.  Thank y 
 This was a ridiculous documentary. I watched with an open mind, and after it was finished I was so irritated because he showed such a one sided biased view, it was ridiculous. Being that it is a Michael Moore movie I should have expected this but I tried to view it openly. Let me warn you now, don't waste 2 hours or 20 dollars 
 My daughter(then 5) really wanted a violin for Christmas.  We already had the FirstAct accordian which she loved.  This, however, she did not.  I can't even make music using the stick.  The heart on the front is a button you push down to make the music "beat of a prerecorded song"  It is impossible to make the song sound good even when using your hand.  The stick is practically useless (except as as weapon.)  The kids usually just had it play on its own.  Everyone got sick of the three recorded songs very quickly.  The little princess on the front moves along with the music (for the first day) She then fell off and broke.  The kids played with it for a few days, but it has been over a year and no one has asked to play with it...even when I take it out and display it.  A Big Waste of Money 
 I loved these so much at first so cute and had great sound. They seemed to act as earplugs to the world outside and I loved that they didn't fall out like other earbuds. However after a month of use the right ear stopped working and no one would take them back very frustrating. Make sure to buy these from the dealer so that they will take them back with the lifetime guarantee. 
 okay. Your first pointer: Do Not Buy. I have been plaing the guitar for 1.5 years but I will tell you I did not start out on this guitar. My neighbors have one and somtimes i'll try to tune it but it dosn't matter because they never play it. the strings never stay tuned and they are horrible quality strings. I own a Gibson Les Paul Epephone. It is my third guiar. Do not even buy your child a guitar unless they are interested. A way you can tell is, How creative are they? How often do they use thier right brain? If they are interested you have to spend atleast $115 for a nice guitar. My eleven year old self hopes that this helped you/ Thank you very much.   
 The book is well written, but is neither the most thorough treatment of the topic, nor the most authentic treatment.  Readers wanting to know what the Jewish traditions are, and why, and how to do them, will want Lamm's book on this subject.  Readers who enjoy presentation and validation of creative but non-traditional practices adapted or invented by less observant Jewish mourners will enjoy this book.  
 I've read only a few of Hillerman's previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. I've enjoyed what I've rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don't indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee' phase.   From what I gather, 'Skeleton Man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman's last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment. 'Skeleton Man' starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life'(See Nelson De Mille's 'Night Fall'), Hillerman fails here. The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called 'action'. Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story. The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman's earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee's wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived 'Superman rescues Lois' situations.  Better to stick with Hillerman's earlier novels. The 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits Hillerman, I'm afraid 
 Ashley Judd's (Normal Life, The Locusts) husband, played by Jim Caviezel (The Passion Of The Christ, Frequency) gets arrested and put on the guilty bench for a slaughter in El Salvador a bunch of years ago. So, Judd hires the always superb Morgan Freeman (Unleashed, Million Dollar Baby) to help her out on the case and to find out the truth while she tries to get her husband out of imprisonment. Judd then has threats on her life after. The opening sequence pulls you in, the thrills are a mixed bag (car crash scene for example was good) and the outcome, well, I really saw coming anyway. Ashley Judd's thrid thriller but its her second one with a murderous manipulative husband(Double Jeopardy). Twisted and Kiss The Girls had a killer running after her or playing games with her noggin. Also starring Bruce Davison (X-Men, Dahmer), Amanda Peet (The Whole Nine Yards, The Whole Ten Yards) and Tom Bower (Die Hard 2 
 I am a fan of Dan Poyter's, and I have learned a lot from this author's monumental work, "The Self-Publishing Manual". I thought this title, "Writing Nonfiction : Turning Thoughts into Books", is another one of such great works. I was so disappointed while reading this book when I realized that it was nothing but a rehash of the original book. I just could not understand how a professional author could have the audacity to publish the same book under two different titles and sell both to the same audience. I don't know if you get, I just don't. To make matters worse, this title is not as detailed as the original work. So, if you are interested in learning from this man, I suggest that you get a copy of "The Self-Publishing Manual", rather than this one. I gave this book 1 star, not because it does not contain useful information, but because it contains nothing new from the author's previous publication. It is really unfortunate. I felt cheated. 
 This wasn't such a bad novel, and I kind of enjoyed it.  Not great, but easy to read and the story chugs along briskly.  However, the ending really killed it for me.  It's too unnecessarily long.  Once the major conflict is resolved, the story is over and yet we must hear a treatise on what it means to be a faerie and the price paid and the virtue of love and heroism and blah blah blah.  I wish I'd just put the book down after the rain because I would've left with a feeling of at least entertainment.  But after reading on and realizing that there were no further complications, only pages of explanations, I just lost much of my enthusiasm for the book.  Would've been three stars if it'd just known when to end 
 I feel as though I have been victimized by a hate crime after reading Hemlock at Vespers.  The short story, THE POISONED CHALICE is purposefully and demonically insulting to the Catholic faith.  The murder weapon is the Most Blessed Blood of Christ which is blasphemy in itself.  The character "sister" Fidelma is quoted as saying, "It is, to my mind, a warning of the dangers of believing what was meant as symbolism is , in fact, a reality"  No greater insult can a Catholic imagine. Shame on you Peter Tremayne 
 GENERALLY GOOD IDEAS BUT MANY THINGS WERE REPEATED AND THIS MADE ME GET BORED BEFORE I FINISHED. I LIKE TO SEE DETAIL AND INFORMATION IN DEPTH 
 I did not choose to read this book... my great-grandmother gave it to me for christmas years ago and I knew I should read it sooner or later. So I read it.  And didn't like it. It was boring, and to me there was no point and each different part starts off like the part before last never happened. These stories don't seem to connect to each other, and I was confused and I wish that the whole story could've been about "The Red Pony" like the title. Because I actually liked the first part, but the rest was a waste of my time. The only good thing I could say about it was that I finally got that one out of the way so now I can read more appealing books 
 A book that is promising a lot, but just doesn't deliver at the end 
 Red Dirt Road was a huge disappointment to me.  I'm a relatively new Brooks & Dunn fan, and I thought Steers & Stripes and If You See Her were fantastic, both loaded with great songs.  This CD, however, had a couple of OK songs, a handful of mediocre ones, and several - Good Cowboy, for example - that I couldn't even stand to listen to all the way through, although I tried several times. Luckily I got it from the library before I bought it, and I didn't even keep it the full 2 weeks.  I can't understand the good reviews that this CD has received.  If you're new to Brooks & Dunn, don't start with this album 
 How sad it is to see what began as a fun series of books end this way. The only good thing in this book is the departure of Polly.  She was much too staid for Qwilleran who needs some fun in his life.  Years ago we did not understand why the author "bumped off" the doctor love interest, suddenly turning her into a villain.  The series began to take on a certain listlessness.  That said, I would like to see Mrs Braun find a competent and enthusiastic co-author who can restore the original concept because Koko and Yum Yum deserve to go out in a blaze of glory.  Besides I would like to know if the barn actually was destroyed by the fire, even if Qwill himself didn't bother to find out 
 There is no doubt that the author is extremely knowledgeable about financial statements, but he struggles to write a clear introduction for newcomers. I finished the book with a muddy, incomplete understanding of financial statements.  In his attempt to introduce financial statements to first-timers like me, the author gets a couple things right:  - it's short. the length is a very comforting 130 pages.    - it's illustrated. there are drawings of scales with profit/loss, etc. This is essential for visual learners like me.  However, the author fails on these points:  - cute phrases instead of genuine insight.  The author's little jokes in the text felt a little self-indulgent, and didn't help explain.  There is one exception: it was useful when the author describes the fans of the various reports - P/L vs Balance vs Cash Flow.  However, most of the rest of the joking was irrelevant and amateur.  - Not well written.  Like many technical books, the quality of writing was poor.  Many parts like first drafts - left me with lots of questions.  The illustrations often felt incomplete and didn't help explain much.   - Expert blindness.  In some ways, experts are the worst people to write books for beginners.  They are passionate about the details and history, which is not what newcomers need.    I understand why financial experts would recommend this book to newcomers: they share the passions of the author. However, this doesn't help newcomers.  I will keep shopping for the book that gives me the basic 'big picture' understanding of financial statements I need 
 The book helps me to "reorganize" all the information that I have learned before (Word & Excel). A few tables are informative but almost the 80% of the content are not helpful, such as guiding you through step by step on how to make things work. If you are an Advanced Microsoft Office user, such as you are advanced in Excel or Word, you might most probably thinking this book is useless. I skipped most of it and I am so tired of reading this book simply because I need to pay an extra affort to filter out the things I knew. Too wordy and the instructions are not clear when guiding you through. Not worth to spend your money on it 
 What a sad book! Read the book and you'll notice how she  preaches depression as the main theme of being a female.Her  answer wouldn't ya know is a psychiatrict drug,Prozaic.Bad idea! I've known many people who have been dupped into taking this  drug,both men and women,the results were heightened bipolar  disorder,paranoia and more depression.It's a sales pitch  for drugs. She wants women to be drug dependent,out of controll of their  lives,helpless.The book does not empower women,it is a depressing book,written to horrify women and get them obsessing  about their every thought and mood. The premise is,all women are more or less the same,she couldn't be further from the truth Be a weary consumer,both in advice and drugs 
 The only inventing uncovered by this book is the inventing that Frank Lambert did in weaving together what he claims are historical facts to showcase his obvious disdain for things Christian and any Christian influence on the history of the United States.  He cannot possibly objectively write about something that he does not in anyway understand and that he clearly abhores.  Frank Lambert fancies himself an historian but he is nothing more than a propagandist plying his craft on unsuspecting but predesposed readers 
 The lyrics to the title track sound like they were written by a 2nd grader. "When the sun goes down we'll be movin'/When the sun goes down we'll be groovin/When the sun goes down feelin' all right/Everything is hotter when the sun goes down."  It almost makes "Got it goin' on like Donkey Kong" seem intelligent.  
   This book was really horrible because.It was really bad.   The reason I didn't like it is because. It was really boring and   stuped. Because thay used old words like Mama, Papa and insted   of dinner thay use supper.    It was also really sad in the beginning because her father dies  her dad died in a stable accident. The stable fell on him. While   he was working on them.    The only part I liked was when she was going to try to get her   own room because. She bugged her sisters and her mom and dad. But  it really got anoing after a while.  Those are the resons I   didn't like like the book     
 Only reason I'm not giving one star is simply because Dodson had access that no other writer was previously granted.  I can only imagine what Curt Sampson would have done with all this extra information.  The only reason I made it through this book is because I'm a Hogan geek.  Anyone remotely well versed in Hogan's history will notice a factual error in just about every chapter.  And for those not well versed in Hogan's history, there are many basic golf facts that don't make sense.  I write this without the book in front of me, but one instance still stands out:  Dodson refers to a 10 birdie round of 64 - with no bogeys.  I know times have changed, but I don't recall many par 74 courses back in the day.  By itself, this can seem like an innocent mistake, maybe even a typo.  But when you pair it with the 100 other similar mistakes you lose credibility in the author.  You also get the idea that Dodson himself isn't very familiar with the game of golf itself - the type of guy who keeps score on his wrist watch and uses 'golf' as a verb.  The last half of the book I was just reading to find a decent quote or two.  There's a reason Sampson's book was so popular and this one wasn't.  
 Only three songs were on this CD. What a rip-off 
 Ms. Castillo's novel should have been incredibly interesting to me, since I am a Hispanic Literature buff and have recently become quite interested in Chicano Literature, but I found this novel tedious and poorly constructed.  The idea of reading the novel in different orders has been USED, as is obvious to any who has read Hopscotch (Rayuela) by Julio Cortázar, and it was best left alone for future use.  Castillo's use of the technique doesn't even match up to the level of a "Choose Your Own Adventure", because the three different reading leave you feeling exactly the same way, BORED.  She makes her novel rest completely on the lives of her characters, but then she doesn't really ever develop them enough for you to become interested.  I never felt like I got to know them hardly at all.  I was a bit disappointed, but I suppose this book could have some attaction to Chicana women who can identify a bit more with the characters.  Maybe being a Chicana woman would help a reader to fill in all the blanks and holes that Castillo leaves in her characterizations 
 "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"   When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live 
 This product was not designed by the 360 team, and really most products that aren't aren't very good for your 360.  This is no exception, it can and has been known to actually damage, and destroy your 360.  A statement from an 360 representative is to not but this product, it has caused numerous problems for a lot of people.  Mainly because it actually draws power from the 360, and that's not good, and leads to a lot of other problems. 
 I'm a sicko of a Yes fan. I own all their albums on vinyl, bought them again on cassette in the 80s, and bought them again on CD in the 90s. But I've got to draw the line somewhere.  How many freakin times can a band re-release the same "greatest hits" with a different cover? When I was notified by Amazon of a new Yes album, I jumped all over it thinking, "the boys are back for the first time in 7 years!" But no, it's more like "the boys have released their 7th greatest hits CD in 7 years."  PLEASE DON'T ENCOURAGE THIS SORT OF BEHAVIOUR! Don't buy this album or it'll just make them do it again, and again, and again. If we all boycott future Yes greatest hits albums, then maybe they'll be forced to actually WORK for their money. I think we'd all enjoy that for a change. WHO'S WITH ME? 
 I thought I had never met a book on statistics I didn't like (i.e., find something useful therein), until I met this book. I bought it in spite of other reviews that mentioned glaring errors that had not been fixed. I felt I knew enough about statistics to fix the errors, and I was interested primarily in the application of statistics to toxicology, for which topic few good texts exist. However, I could never have imagined the monumental scale of the corrections needed.  In this book (supposedly in its 3rd edition), in my opinion there is essentially NOTHING in the text without errors and omissions, except possibly the SAS programs given, which are possibly useful to the neophyte in SAS. Formulae are unintelligible, missing parentheses and using improper symbols and typesetting. Symbols are referenced that are never defined, etc. Apparently the author just created a montage of clips from other works without regard to antecedent explanation and had zero concern for correctness (he should be ashamed).   Finally, in my opinion, the author does not appear from his writings to be the expert in the field that one would expect from the book title. He does appear to be a toxicologist, but his knowledge of statistics appears rudimentary and confused.  I was truly disappointed by this book, because my needs remain unsatisfied. Its true value lies solely in the table of contents (so you can look up elsewhere the techniques referenced) and the SAS program snippets. Everything else is untrustworthy, incomplete and generally contaminated by errors. If the author cared the least bit about accuracy and content, he could have made his book enormously more useful in the 1st, 2nd or 3rd edition. The eternal optimist may hope for this in the 4th edition 
 I received this book as a gift, ....after reading it I disposed of it.  I found it to be disrespectful of our Savior.  Lucado suggests that the reason Jesus went to the wedding at Cana was because He wanted to "twirl the bride around the dance floor".  This is the Son of God we're talking about, not some red-blooded human ordinary male.    He uses a lot of space to write short, incomplete sentences that are supposed to grip us, I guess.  It didn't grip me 
 If you want to read a great book on personal illness by a fine writer, read Reynolds Price' "A Whole New Life."  The prose is authentic and there is not a touch of pretense in it.   Styron's lack of insight into his illness is topped only by his lack of knowledge of abnormal psychology.  His declaration that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is disturbing, because it mixes cause and effect.  His assertion is tantamount to attributing global warming to melting glaciers.  Mixing cause and effect is not something one would attribte to a writer of his distinction, as it is the essence of clear thought.  Yes, the intensity and distribution of various neuro-chemicals have been found to be compromised among those suffering depression who have been tested.  But how are they compromised?  Contrary to the author's belief that "the madness results from an aberrant biochemical process," and that "such madness is chemically induced," it is the commonly-held view today that psychology plays the decisive causitive role in mental illness, as that psychology is formulated and developed throughout life, and is influenced by situations, including loss, misuse of drugs and alcochol, and unconscious dilemmas, among others.   That an organic etiology has been surmised in many cases of schizophrenia and other psychosis, as well as in profound obsessions, certainly "rules in" brain damage, whether it is evident at birth, or the result of other physical and emotional trauma later in life; but it does not rule out psychology and the higher order mental functions we attribute to consciousness.       
 And I do mean REALLY STUPID. Like a previous reviewer, I bought this to keep me occupied on a long flight. When, within the first 20 or so pages, the author introduces two made-up gimmicks that are central to the plot, I knew I was in trouble. First up is a liquid nuclear explosive. Yeah, right. Anyone who even slept through high school physics would know that's a crock. Then there is the super oxygen carrying blood transfusion that gets the major bad guy through an execution. In a science fiction story, the spare use of such gimmicks might be ok. But here the author uses them because he just isn't bright enough to come up with a good story otherwise.     Had I been on a train trip, this book would have gone right out the train window. However, they frown on opening windows on airplanes so I just left it on the plane. I probably should have taken it off with me and tossed it in the trash to save the next passanger in my seat from having to deal with this 
 Milencolin, dropkick murphys, the offspring, pennywise, all good bands, but drowned in this sea of p.u.s.s.y a.s.s b.u.l.l.s.h.i.t, they lose all their bite, and it causes me pain to see them on the same track list as posers like underoath and fall out bo 
 I am a reviewer and I was checking out this 'sleep aid' when it struck me as strange that almost every review for this product sounds like a promotion of the product, not a review, AND note that the reviewers have only one review (click on their 'see all my reviews').  Beware of this shoddy marketing ploy.    This 'crud' alone merits my one star rating.  Amazon needs to censor these reviews 
 I thought that this short story was very confusing.  Being the age of only 14, I had to read this short story for a book report.  I had some difficulty understanding what it meant and how it all added up in the end.  I think that this is one of Edgar Alan Poe's horrible short stories.  The story had many words that were hard to understand and it didn't make sense at the end.  I reccommend this story to older teenagers and adults.  It is to complicated for young teenagers 
 sound the same, these guys call themselves producers?? Mas Flow and Mas Flow 2 were okay, the first Flow was 3-4 stars easy, but soon after listening to their beats you find out they all sound the same from other productions. ALSO doesn't help that every 90% of the reggaeton artist use Luny Tunes for their beatz. LOS BENJAMINS was just a weak album, not one good song/hit came out of it. We need to old producers como dj nelson, dj frank, playero, etc..e.tc.. 
 I've been a developer for more than 20 years, moved off to management about 4-5 years ago.  So I decided to learn .net {previous experience with Delphi and VB) by acquiring the Deluxe Learning Edition of VB .net 2003.  I found this book to be very difficult to get through because it was entirely too basic.  If anyone is serious about doing computer programming, the authors should at least assume the reader knows and understands something - this book's audience appeared to be for middle school readers, not people aspiring to be computer programmers.  Beginning Visual Web Programming in VB.NET {from Novice to Professional} is far superior and doesn't leave me feeling like a fourth grader. 
 I have found that this book was a weak and uncreative attempt to brand "BLUR" as a modern innovation of conducting business when it has simply re-spun and devalued traditional business practices into a dot com unsustainable ideal. This book preaches that there is little need for the tangible bottom line for the intangibles of business out weigh the value of the actual assets. That may be partially true; however, what actually happens when that model is embraced is uncontrollable corruption in the market. If you are a beginner in the business world and have trouble reading, you will find a few good business ideas and examples within the double spaced, trivially written text. However, as it was published in 1999 most of the ideas are now a BLUR of the past. There are better books out there. Don't waste your time 
 I returned my Banshee stereo. It sure was loud, however the music seemed to wave in and out.  You cannot charge your iPOD either.  There is no remote.  There is no battery compartment - not portable at all.  There are many other choices for less price.  Save your money and look for something else 
 I have no idea whether Mr. Spector is guilty of the serious charges against him, but he stands convicted of allowing his retrospective box to be released with some of the muddiest, dullest mastering in memory. Sound-wise, a total mess. Of course, many of the tracks are indispensable. 
 This has to be one of Betty Grable's LEAST entertaining musicals. Why didn't they release Mother Wore Tights, The Dolly Sisters, Moon Over Miami or any of the 20+ other Technicolor musicals she made for Fox between 1940 and 1953.....not THIS turkey 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.  I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good.          
 While this scanner is quite fast at running documents through, I found that it could not come close to getting any of them properly aligned. I spent more time de-skewing scans than it would have taken to do it on a flatbed scanner. It is plenty good for having 'good enough' images for record keeping, but useless if you are trying to keep higher quality digital records of paper documents 
 The very title for the book - "I Con" - despite its cleverness, should reveal the lack of any objectivity, or class for that matter, from the authors, Jeffrey S. Young & William L. Simon. I could best describe this book as a shoddy pastiche of ambiguous-sounding facts, poor research, colored by a palpable disdain for [arguably the most interesting legend of our time] Steve Jobs.  What is really distasteful is that this antipathy of the authors towards Steve Jobs, seems 'personal'; which, in a democratic sense, may be alright i guess, [but only] UNTIL facts begin to wear thin, and the research seems doctored, leaving the rants sounding hollow, unsavory and shrill. And the facts aren't well-strung together either!  From the very opening description in the book, which overdramatizes and harps on about the return of a "reformed" Steve Jobs, to Apple in 1997 (as though the most unfathomably impossible phenomenon in the history of humankind had occurred), to the careful selection of maliciously undertoned quotations, and quite often blatant slanders about Jobs, the book appears to be a collation of 'hate diaries' maintained by two wannabe authors, whose sole purpose in writing this book seems to be to fuel an anti-Steve sentiment among its readers!  If you happen to be one of those people, who finds some twisted pleasure in those idle conversations that involve scandalmongering [especially Steve Jobs], then this book should provide ample fuel for your negative energy 
 Without trying to sound overly negative this is subpar engineering and production at its finest.  First, I was expecting something that would assemble "in minutes"... guess when you dont qualify how many that years are also broken into "minutes".. this unit has roughly 60 individual pieces that require assembly not including nuts and bolts.  Finish was VERY poorly applied and rust was already visible on the carbon steel on the underside of the side burner.  Guage of steel for the cart assembly is subpar.  Amazon has been very good to deal with and is refunding my puchase and returning the grill.  There are many better systems available out there than this.  Very disappointing merchandise and misleading advertising on the manufacturers end.  I made the mistake of buying prior to any of these units being available locally because I thought I was getting a good deal 
 What started out as a somewaht interesting read quickly degenerated into an obviously hastily written attempt at demonstrating  to Mr Pickover what a great he is in his own mind.  Between self serving reminders of of many books he has published, he occasionally does present an interesting concept or two, but the frustraton in having to wade through the endless tedium made me want to shove an ice pick through my left temple.  I heartily enjoyed "A Passion for Mathematics",  I wish I hadn't bought this one 
 I got this book as a gift from my sister, so I read it out of deference to her. But let me tell you it was a mighty painful process, and not from what you think. It wasn't from the painful realities I was hit with but the blathering wimpy self-deprecating loathing that guy exudes. When you stop whining and worrying and apologizing and agonizing about women, then you've arrived my son.....no need to waste your money on this book, better to spend it on a John Ford/John Wayne movie. That'll give you yer fill of manliness..... 
 Mr. Yancey has written no book that helps Christians submit to Christ's rule on earth.  It's clear that Mr. Yancey is not interested in submitting himself to Christ's rule or helping others to submit themselves' to Christ's rule.  Maybe he's working for the anit-Christ.  The Bible is clear that we must seek first the Kigndom of Christ and His Righteousness -- before anything else.  This important Biblical principle is found all over the Bible -- in the Old Testament and the New Testament.  In fact, the New Testament is more emphatic.  Jesus Christ Himself said that if a person does not hate his father, mother, children, sisters, brothers, then he cannot be Jesus Christ's disciple.  Bible emphasizes love for Christ and loyalty to Christ above all else even to the point of hating your unbelieving family member who gets in the way of your submission and obedience to the rule of Christ.  Mr. Yancey does not seeem to respect the teachings of Jesus Christ as found in the Gospels.  The Gospels is clear and these are the words of Jesus Christ Himself.  Christians must not be disappointed by God.  Even if Christ sends a massive hurricaine and kills every living person in Houston, Texas, this year, their relatives should praise the Name of Jesus Christ and give glory to Him BECAUSE He has killed their relatives.  We have to submit to the absolute authority of Christ the King who is our God 
 Gimme a break.  Mailer should stop tooting his own horn and write some fiction that isn't so imbued with egotistical dross.  Nobody cares about Mailer's craft, and why should we when he's written longwinded stinkers like Naked and the Dead or Harlot's Ghost.  The man needs to check himself before he wrecks himself.  That ego does nothing for his writing, no matter how many awards he's won.  He should stick to what he knows like being a verbose senile buffoon and stabbing his wife 
 Whyte's historical knowledge and presentation of 4th and 5th century life creates a credible and interesting background for this story. As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one 
 This is another wooden, easily solved Krentz book.  What has happened to the author who wrote such classics as Absolutely, Positively or Trust Me?  These last few years have been nothing but one formulaic, clunky novel after another, with tiresome characters and easily-predicted plotlines.  I want the excitement and energy of her ealier novels, not some rehashed pulp with her name attached to boost sales.  I hate to say it, but I think I'm about ready to stop reading Krentz and look elsewhere for my romance jollies.  Don't waste your time with this book--go back and read some of her stuff from the nineties & see what a really well-written, exciting, and romantic novel can be like when it's done as well as Ms. Krentz can do 
 The picture and sound quality is very bad. It has not improved since the Amos & Andy shows were released on VHS. If they cannot be restored, a disclamer of the bad picture and sound quality should be published for the DVD and the price should be lowered significantly 
 The issue of how best to govern a nation is of great importance and should be explored through intellectual, logical debate.  Dahl's book does not carry the weight this topic deserves because he entirely avoids exposure of the logical constructs from which his conclusions stem.  Dahl's unstated presupposition is that democracy is a superior form of government compared with representative democracy.  This presupposition is never discussed and simply assumed true by Dahl.  This is strong evidence that Dahl hopes to persuade, not promote his ideas in this op-ed piece.  Since he offers no logical constructs regarding his specific ideas and avoids direct questioning of potential hazards of his ideas, he does not offer the non-critically thinking reader pause for review.  Instead he promotes safe, non-threatening ideas that will be easily agreed to by the reader.  Once the reader is agreeing with what is said it is nearly effortless to get the reader to agree to the next idea, even if the two ideas are completely unrelated.  In fact, the very fashion in which Dahl presented his justification for changing the constitution was one such trick.    Dahl states that during the time of the constitutional convention we were far less technologically advanced.  He tells the reader that DaVinci could have done absolutely marvelous things had modern technology been at his dispose.  This is certainly debatable if one were to stop and question what circumstances allowed DaVinci to do what he had done.  However, for most, this is an idea that will be readily agreed to and will strike imagination and hope, exactly the combination needed to persuade people of such things as Dahl desires.  Dahl never strikes his assumption that technological advances also bring about social and political advances, for which he could have at least made a case.  He never brings the topic for discussion and simply behaves as if the point had been struck.  However, societal advances are not directly conjured through technological advances and in many cases societal norms become less democratic (what Dahl would call more advanced) with technological advances.  And thus, we can see why Dahl avoided intellectual debate and instead opted for a trick.  This is an old, extremely effective sales trick which has personally been used to do things like sell movies to people that did not own a television and found movies morally wrong.  This anecdote is not just presented to expose Dahl's method, but is also presented here to strike a point:  People are gullible and will easily agree to do things to which they are morally opposed, much less unsure of or apathetic to.  This is the very reason to avoid a direct democracy and there are historical examples of such things happening, which of course, Dahl fails to acknowledge.  Furthermore, it is precisely self-serving tricksters that the founding fathers had in mind when writing the constitution--no wonder Dahl detests it so.  Dahl uses others tricks that an unsuspecting reader will miss.  For example, Dahl goes through some effort to legitimize his term "founding framers," in preference to "founding fathers."  This has absolutely no relevance to the discussion of representative government versus pure democracy.  However, what it does do is remove a name that places the creators of the constitution on a pedestal and replaces it with something less reverent.  This is not to suggest that changing the name to "founding framers," and removing some of the reverence is a bad thing.  But combined with the other tricks in this book, it is highly suspicious and comes across as name calling.    Furthermore, it is a rather surprising move on Dahl's part after he showed such deftness with persuasion (discussed in the previous paragraph) in other parts of the book.  The reason it is surprising is that the very people he would hope to convince would likely be the people that would put his book away after reading this passage.  Dahl is certainly not a dumb individual; so for whom is this book written, the like minded or the variant of Dahl?  It is most likely the latter of the two. He claims that Tocqueville predicted a "collapse of society," due to the nature of a pure democracy and gives examples of trials which modern societies have faced without collapsing.  Yet, again, he fails to address the heart of his argument and instead opts for something safe and at best tangent to his point, i.e. wars and depression which have nothing to do with the nature of democracy causing a legislative overload and collapse.  And yet, Tocqueville is highly accurate when he discusses the stifling laws and regulations that will govern a purely democratic state.  On needs to look no further than license requirements for bicycles in modern democratic countries.  Dahl claims he believes in "intrinsic equality," which he defines as inalienable political equality among all citizens.  He further claims that the intrinsic equality is what not only allows but actually promotes democracy because the majority population will respect the intrinsic equality of the minority population.  So, live and let live, allow for consideration of differences of opinion on even the most important subjects is what Dahl claims to believe in and promote.  However, talk is cheap.  Dahl later states, "...it is difficult for me to see how a significantly different proposition could be defended, particularly if we draw on crucial historical cases...," (131).  He later refers to his own judgments as, "prudent," while referring to the judgments of others as based in "hopeless ignorance."  It appears that Dahl fails to uphold the very standard he promotes as being the basis for a pure democracy.    Dahl directly states that he considers his own opinions correct and prudent and perceives views in variation from his own as invalid.  He claims that the founding fathers had personal motivations and designed our government to promote their own interests.  He claimed that people today are superior that people in the past.  And because of these things, it must seem to Dahl that the debate of a purely democratic society versus a representative democracy is moot.  That said, merit exists in some of his points and objections about our current government.  However, his methods of tricking and avoiding direct promotion of his ideas are distasteful and less effective than its compliment.  Without allowing the reader preview to arguments, one cannot accurately gauge Dahl's position and thus cannot identify where differences of opinion stem.  Since it is highly unlikely that Dahl will be charged with the tasks of creating a new constitution, it is likely that Dahl's work will only benefit his cause by creating a stir among his like-minded, which is certainly not respectful to Dahl's dissenters.      If offered the opportunity, it would be of great interest to hear what Dahl would say regarding the role of pure democracy in the fall of Athens, or to have him explain what mechanism would prevent a pure democracy from passing arbitrary or spiteful laws into action.  Or perhaps it would be good to see a working example of a successful pure democracy in business or politics (money and power); the two things that ultimately drive government action.  These are the issues that his concepts bring forth and since he wholly failed to address them, his book lacks the weight required to address how to best govern a free body of people. 
 I used Tend Skin for a few years and it was the best one that I could find but a few weeks ago I saw a nother product on Amazon called Solution 2 and ordered it instead.  I was a little worried because I was getting good results with the bumps with Tend Skin but it burned a lot and dried out my skin quite a bit.  Solution 2 is definitely a better product for me with my sensitive skin and it works just as good on the bumps 
 I only read this book because it was required by a management professor.   The book contains enough eco-trash logic to make you wince in pain.  The  authors would have you believe that business owners will succumb to the  temptation of giving up their profits for the good of the community.  Not  only do the authors repeatedly promote an organization called the NIEO,  they use words that soften their political philosphy.  They say the second  wave of business ownership is "Stockholders", the third is  "Worker Ownership" and the fourth "Communitarian".   "Communitarian"? What is that?  Sounds like you know what.  They  base their analyses on exactly zero facts, or at least questionable  conclusions.  Reading this book was torture.  A better read about business  and how it should and will operate is "Reframing Organizations"  by Bolman and Deal.  In case you haven't guessed, I'm a  "Capitalitarian" 
 This was a very creative fun book. Very funny. But I mean, how many pages can you read of e-mails? It was great the 1st two hundred pages, and then it got repetitive. Yes it is well written, and I really felt like I was reading e-mails from  real people. But,nearly 400 pages of this? No, eventually, I gave up through 220 pages or so. This would have been a really great mid-section, or parts, of the book, But the whole thing? That was too much. Read if your daring or for something different. Just want to let you know 
 And if you aren't already a fan, I can't imagine you'd be interested in this quick gloss over of Harrison's life.  Honestly, I was given this book as a present.  And I read it over two days when I was home sick.  The book is an easy read, and isn't poorly written.  It doesn't sensationalize or gossip either. Thus the second star on the rating.  But there was almost nothing in this book that I didn't already know.  It was same as watching the show "Biography".     If you need this book for your Harrison collection, then look for it in the bargain bin.  Otherwise, I'd stay away. 
 i was quite disappointed.  i had hoped for a few things i could incorporate into my own party giving. but i consider it to be a guide to working with a party planner. no recipes, no how tos.  for instance the section on music suggest that you ask the DJ for a list of the types of parties he's worked.  i'd prefer a list from david of the best jazz cds to serve at brunch 
 I bought this book in order to get some context for the situation today with Chavez.  However, the auother seems to get lost in his own head and and for large parts of the book fails to describe anything other than a load of overly sohpisticated academic speak that nobody understands.  While there are a few excellent chapters in it I felt a bit let down 
 I enjoyed Ferling's Leap In The Dark immensely.  It was a well-written, far-reaching, grand book that formed a great cohesive work.  As such, i figured this book (about a very under-reported time-period in US history) would be a slam-dunk.  Not so.  It's almost as if Ferling expended so much energy with Leap that he decided to phone this one in.  It's incohesive, jumping around with little regard to logical continuity.  Yet, even at this, it comes off as a shallow non-scholarly work that is better suited to a magazine article than a book.  I was about ready to have Ferling join McCullough & Ellis as authors i would count on to deliver quality consistently.  Alas, not quite yet.  
 About 6 years ago I saw a 20/20 feature about this generation's greatest author Thomas Pynchon, and how incredibly acclaimed and mysterious he is.  So I figured I would check out his work.  I had begun reading fairly intensely and wanted to see what all the buzz was about.  I picked Vineland because it looked intriguing, and hey, anything that features lesbian ninjas can't be bad right??  Well, unfortunately the 20/20 segment was far more intriguing than this book.  I honestly don't understand what all the buzz is about.  Maybe it's because I didn't live through the 60's, or didn't grow up in Humbolt county.  But I certainly don't "get" Pynchon at all.  The man has an incredible imagination, but the problem is that the stories he concocts lack almost everything that I treasure in literature.  The characters are quirky, but I don't care about them.  The circumstances are ridiculous, but rarely to the point beyond a half-amused chuckle.  The "plot" wanders all over the place but ultimately leads nowhere.  If there's a point or theme that the author is trying to convey, it's hidden far beneath the depth which I would care to dig.  Looking back, I can't remember the characters, or the resolution.  I just remember it being a very disjointed story.  It's sad to me that someone with Pynchon's obvious mental and literary prowess, can't use them to write something that is moving, or teaches you something.  Something that sticks with you for life.  My recomendation to people who are considering reading Pynchon: if you like Tom Robbins, go ahead and try Pynchon.  For those who want something a bit more substantive, read John Irving.    Note: It IS possible for some of us to enjoy Stephen King, as well as, the acclaimed "literary" scribes like Saramago, McEwen, Umberto Eco etc.  It just takes a little less pretension, and an open mind.    ...and for the record, the lesbian ninjas were a big disapointment.        
 what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke.  I hated it 
 In this book the author tells us so there are only 2 effective attacking procedures, which leading to success - the combined attack and double blow. This is very important and not quite understood, but if you mastery these techniques you might not be so dangerous, but much more carefully player. If you want to make this book useful to you, you have to study it very carefully and minimum twice (it is thin - only 110 pages). All subjects are devoted to tactics, but there is one chapter devoted to strategy of attack. If you are "tactics scientific" you are in good place. In this book there are few useful mating attack mechanisms, it has showed coordination of the pieces and combinations - how it has born and how arises. I like to recover it because from time to time (once a 2-3 months), because each time I read it, I discover new things - particuraly how important is coordination of the pieces, how hidden treats are dangerous and complex to recognize (and to build) - sometimes they are very deep underground, but if you know how they build [what elements] and how to recognize them early, then you should not be afraid of them. I should note: sometimes complexity of chess combinations are sometimes very frustrating too see, but in closer look (and with much practice!) you can see and understand that they are "connected [composed] simple blocks". This book contains 19 (short) chapters and has no any tasks to solve. Level of this book is not so high [it is not difficult; maybe a bit - especially for quite begginers]. Advice for begginers: when you study it carefully you might see that it is quite fine and nice. To the end of my opinion I can only say that this author is respected Soviet author... (he wrote great endings in 5 volumes 20 years ago). I think this book is too expensive if you compare price to what it contains. If you want any good book about tactics and combinations you should to consider (best im my opinion): "Art of Attack in Chess" by Vladimir Vukovic or "One Thousand and One Winning Chess Sacrifices and Combinations". IMPORTANT: Review of Paul Imseih (Sydney) [Complete waste of money, January 30, 2005] is right :-(. This book is really poor. If you have bag of money to waste you might buy it, but I think there are many books much better than this one (see a bit sooner). If you have to buy book of this author you might buy "Chess Tactics for Advanced Players" - this is really good book which is worth its money. But this "Chess middlegames - essential knowledge" with 100% certanity is not! I gave it note 2 stars, because material might be interested (but not for 15$ - maximum 3 to 5$) 
 Yes, I love Microsoft Office. It's incredibly user friendly, it has wonderful features, most of which I don't even know how to use, and it's spelling and grammar checking features are the best of it's kind. I've been fortunate enough to have been a student up to now in my life and therefore did not have to buy Microsoft for my personal use, the school would always buy one for me. And of course there are always illegitimate means... but I'm not advocating piracy here.  However, I would be the last person on earth to consider using Microsoft Office if I had to pay $350 for it. It's an insane price. consider the alternatives:  Open Office: Does everything MS Office does, some things even better. I love how you don't need to buy or install anything extra to type mathematical formulas in Open Office. The best thing about this, however, is that it's FREE!  Google Docs and Spreadsheets: This one is even better. Not only is it free like everything else from Google, you can COLLABORATE IN REAL TIME with  anybody else on the internet to write your word documents! Nothing beats that, it's just the most wonderful thing that Google has done 
 The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson    
 I give this one a single-star review, for many of the same reasons discussed in the previous 1- and 2-star reviews.  
 the first chapter was awesome... lan gearing up for a battle, there's suspense, there's a promise of action, i was excited to read more.  i'm halfway through the book now and it's been nothing since but morraine and siuan chapters... what is robert jordan's problem?  why spoil a great fantasy series with chapter after chapter of catty females, i don't understand why i still read this author 
 First of all I do think Toby Keith has talent. There are songs from his previous work that I like and prove his skill and talent as a songwriter and musician. With this album I fear that he is continuing a slide into self-parody and risks the possibility that he won't be taken seriously and he will become a caricature. One of the things I have respected about him was that early in his career he had the integrity to be himself and do the music he wanted to and not what the executives in Nashville wanted him to do. That's artistic integrity. But I fear that the niche he carved for himself might turn into a grave for his career. He found his place in country music as the rebellious macho outspoken country boy. But now that has become the formula which sells a product and he seems to be milking that formula for all the profit that its worth But he is losing his soul in the process and becoming at some level the very thing he rebelled against. Now he panders to a certain fan-base and risks encouraging every country/red-neck/hick stereotype, prejudice and clichï¿½ that can be so detrimental, divisive and harmful. The testosterone filled music which he helped popularize and is currently being played by artists such as Montgomery-Gentry will run's its course and fizzle in popularity. When that is done will anyone want to listen to Toby Keith anymore? I hope he gets back on track and instead of trying to please a certain demographic for temporary gain he looks within and writes music that has the possibility of becoming timeless. 
 As of Sunday, January 29, 2006, these goods have NOT arrived? When will they arrive? Could you follow up asap please.  regards,  T Davie 
 This book is terrible, awful, and immoral and if you love Danielle Steel books (don't bother to read this one).  My fiancee and I love to read to each other and I got angry/mad after reading this book.  I just don't believe that marriage is based on cheating.  I think Danielle Steel may have had one to many drinks while writing this book 
 Not all that useful, really.  Message is "buy mutual funds!".  In general, since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market, just buy index funds would be the best advice.  Most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks.  Passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the CEO to go over the financials and confirm your valuation.  Oh, thanks Peter, what great advice... ("Mr. Gates, your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares") 
 I was looking forward to receiving this body lotion; however was very disappointed when I opened it and smelled the fragrance.  It smells exactly like paint.  Then after a few minutes it seems to just disappear with a faint paint-like scent.  I will not buy any more Philosophy products.  The less expensive fragrances/lotions are so much better that you buy from Target, Wal-Mart, etc 
 Anyone familiar with Charlie Haden's duo or trio work might be dissapointed by American Dream. Haden has always managed to express sentiment without added sweetner but this recording is over the top on production and orchestration.  Think of a jazz version of the abysmal Elvis Costello/Bert Bacharach outing.  Some of the best contemporary American jazz musicians, Haden, Keith Jarrett, Pat Metheny, etc. have kept their distance from the easy listening and retro styles that dominate "popular" jazz radio while still creating accessable music, moody, thoughful and often beautiful.  They share that ECM avant-garde edge with European counterparts like Tomasz Stanko, Bobo Stenson, Tord Gustavsen and Keitel Bjornstad.  Unfortunately, American Dreams is a lot closer to Yanni than to The Liberation Orchestra. 
 I am in the process of returning this book right now.  I thought the book might be about a first day starting school - as in Kindergarten or Preschool.  Any age would have been fine.  I thought the character might be a little nervous not terrified.  We are talking about a grown woman - a teacher!  I know they get nervous and who can blame them.  But this is not the kind of example I want for my daughter. They use the word hate - the teacher says 'I hate this new school' - that's not the kind of language I want to hear from my daughter at the age of 4.  If the teacher "hates" school how can we encourage our daughter to be excited about going. This book maybe would have been more appropriate if we had an older child with school experience moving to a new school - its not for preschool or kindergarten kids.  The illustrations aren't cute.    I have never returned a book. Usually I just pass a book I don't care for on but I just couldn't take it. You may find it cute and clever. I gave it 1 star because I had to. My advice - if you buy it, read it yourself first and keep the handy return policy in mind. We also bought My First Day of School by P. K. Hallinan  - that one is very cute for preschool & kindergaten.  Thanks for listening 
 For several days I wore the watch in conjuntion with a belt-affixed pedomoter to establish the accuracy of the watch.  On every occasion, the watch did not count all the steps 
 Can someone seriously explain how and why Betty Hutton became a star?  Her one talent seems to be her volume.  She is entirely without subtlety, sincerity, honesty in her acting and is a mediocre singer.  She merely shouts.  The production numbers are well done and Howard Keel does well, especially since he is playing opposite a fire engine siren.  
 Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the "strongest/purest" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 "perfect" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.  Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with "the deathbed edition" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.   I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.   To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The "true" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers.. 
 Buy this if you want to purchase every book on this subject, or buy The Concierge Manual for $15 more and you won't need to look any further 
 This only worth reading if you enjoy reading about women peeing!  Having to pee, going to pee, talking about peeing, peeing in the ocean, peeing on the ground.  Or if you like to read about women endlessly drinking tea. Drinking herbal tea, pouring tea, making tea, putting milk in a pitcher for the tea--on and on and on--Or if you want to read about how old men can't perform in bed because their arms hurt, their ex-wives call, they're too prissy, they're too selfish--blah blah BLAH!    This book is just an endless recitation of menopausal problems, sex problems, relationship problems, bladder problems--Good God--give it a rest!  I used to like Nancy Thayer's books but this is just superficial junk. 
 The good first. There is a lot of good. I enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal.   My husband and I have a great marriage. He knows I have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me. He is certainly not ever wanting more sex, just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes. (In jest I'm sure.)I say that to show, that not coming from a prude, the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it's normal. I am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice. It was dealt with like, it's a fact so get used to it.  Your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look, or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night. The men give accounts of this, like, oh well, doesn't mean I don't love my wife.  In my opinion, just b/c they aren't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts, doesn't mean it's ok.   I found the book to be very very discouraging. That a bunch of married Christian men would unapologetically (key word here)see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less (we're not talking lingerie here) and think about what she's like in bed or what her nipples look like. There's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart. Or maybe they should not do this. It really threw me for a loop! I guess I didn't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are. Not that I think they don't want a lot of it. But I found it discouraging for Christian wives to think that their husbands can't go to work without picturing everyone naked.  I found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it's "normal" and women just need to get used to the idea 
 Here's the news:less than half the forces on the allied side on D Day were from the  U.S. Would you guess that from reading Ambrose's book? - nope. The vast bulk of the volume is devoted to the U.S. experience. It seems Ambrose thinks the British, Canadians etc were just there to make up the numbers.  It's just not acceptable for a historian to devote the bulk of what purports to be an account of that day to one national contingent and then call it 'D Day' . To perpetrate that is petty and appallingly parochial.  Worse: it's offensive to the memories of ALL those who fought and died for democracy. The American sacrifice was real and  doesn't need this sort of thing to keep its memory green.  Robin Neillands and John Keegan have both written much better, fairer accounts.  If Ambrose had called the book 'the American contribution to D-Day' no one could have complained. As it is, it has no claim to our serious consideration as history. 
 THE BEGINING WAS VERY AMUSING BUT AS IT GETS ON I JUST DON'T FEEL THE ROMANCE ANYMORE. THE SEX IS PRETTY MUCH CONSTANT BUT THE HEROINE'S CHARACTER WAS WAY TOO CHILDISH. SHE DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE UNTIL THE END OF THE BOOK. SHE'S NOT VERY EXCITING OR UNDERSTANDING LIKE THE OTHER FEMALE IN DARA JOY'S OTHER BOOK. THE GIRL JUST LEFT ME COLD AND SORRY FOR THE GUY. WELL, THE GUY IS VERY SWEET AND TRIED TO WOO HER FROM THE BEGINING TO THE END. AT FIRST IT WAS JUST A CHALLENGE TO HIM BUT THEN IT BECOMES A LOVE CHASE. I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY CUTE. ALTHOUGH HE'S A GREAT CHARACTER, THE ONGOING OF HIS MASCULINITY IS VERY ANNOYING IN THE HEROINE'S POINT OF VIEW. IT MAKES ME THINK SHE'S LUSTING AFTER HIM. BUT ANYWAY, I FIRST I ENJOYED THE BOOK BUT STILL IT LEFT ME UNCERTAIN OF THEIR FUTURE TOGETHER. IF IT WAS ANY OTHER HEROINE, THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE PULL IT OFF EASILY 
 It is truly disturbing to see books like this apologia for human behavior enter the reproductive arena of argument and try  to come away with something positive to say about the population disaster awaiting us.  The sad fact is that humans are rapidly overwhelming the earth's resources to the point that their numbers cannot be sustained.  Culture of Death???  The only culture of death relevant to this nightmare is that such a point of view so incredibly ignorant is now being given the publishing light of day.  Just perfect to give everyone yet another excuse to do nothing constructive, only destructive.  Reproductive rights need to be limited, as do human numbers.  A life without hope is indeed a culture of death and it is moronic, dillitante views like those in this book that only serve to perpetuate it.  If these authors lived on Easter Island, it would have sunk into the ocean due to the overburdening weight of the existing, increasing human mass.   Welcome to the end.   Thank you, religious hacks,  blinded authors, and the morass of idiots who believe that the world just needs a better management model to make things work.  Please visit Mexico, India and Africa at your earliest opportunity to promote your thoughts, and, perhaps, get a glimpse of what awaits all of us if this scourge of increasing humanity is not remedied.             
 It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters.  Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while).  There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had.  The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors.  
 This CD is not good. It's a nonstop pulsating beat with almost no lyrics. I was hoping for something similar to the DMA compilation tapes. This is not it 
 While I know that this book is considered by many to be a great classic, when I read it I literally had to force myself to finish this book over the course of a month, when normally it would have taken me a matter of days. The writing dragged on and on and on with little details and events I could have cared less about. The characters did not appeal to me, except for Claudia and ""SOILER"" she was killed off rather quickly, compared to the rest of the book. The only thing that attracted me to her was her determination and more ruthless personality than Lestat and Louis, who were, in my honest opinion, too effeminite for me to greatly like. I suppose the overall story is interesting, but it is so lost in a web of mind-numbing writing and weak characters that it was impossible for me to enjoy in any way. 
 This book, although quite interesting seems to be written mostly not to explain the subject to the reader, but to confuse the reader with lots of irrelevant details. The author seems to lack the ability to stick to his point, and drifts away from it more than once in most chapters. The structure of the book looks very appealing by the mixture of two questions. But as it turns out, the holistic/individual & explaining/understanding distinctions are not stricly seperated, or usefully connected. Some comparisions made in this book (for example, the different book of Durckheim are compared in a quite messy way) are in my opinion just their because the author wanted to show off how much he has read. Alltogether I think this book is really a waste of paper, ink and time. So I would recommend NOT to buy this book; try to look for a book by an other author when you're interesseted in this subject 
 I had high hopes for this book. I was sorely disappointed. The author kept going on and on with his theories about why the Roman Empire collapsed. Every time I thought he was about to get around to some IRISH history, he went back to Rome, or some other culture. I can understand setting the stage, but this was ridiculous. Halfway through, I gave up, skimmed the rest of the book, and decided it wasn't worth the time 
   First, I know this review looks too long, but it might help you out. So please, read on.  I read a few of the "chapters" (exercise sections) of this book and found it to be a little too conversational. Sure, we all value a charming and witty instruction book to a dry academic one, but I still think she brings nothing new to this genre of book.    It seems like she could easily have gotten all of these ideas from other writing books, seminars and articles, and frankly, most of them are better written than this one. You've probably encountered most of the ideas put forth in this book, beginning with an intro akin to:    "Oh, we all say we're going to write, but we never get around to it. Well never, fear, because [insert generic writing guide book title] is here to kick your rear in gear!"    Something like that.     There are really so many different types of books, kits, articles, memoirs, classes and manifestos on the subject of writing, exercises, inspiration and so forth. (Just do a search on Amazon for Writing Instruction or Writing for Publication.)  I really can't recommend this book, though.      Unfortunately, the author also thinks it's cute or somehow necessary to write quite a few words in ALLCAPS to add emphatic notice to the concept. Personally, I think that WRITING like THIS every few PAGES looks unprofessional and can be quite IRRITATING. This stylistic flaw alone makes me wonder whether she's a very credible source. Is font manipulation creative? Sure, to an extent, but "all-caps" serves no purpose, and it's easy to do and banal.     I think that this work misses a point about writing: it requires self-discipline as well as inspiration and talent. It's easy and sometimes fun to get caught up in books like these, but really, if you just read a varity of nonfiction, novels and periodicals for a few hours each week you can begin to understand observational skills, and you won't need these silly little exercises.  You'll be inspired by what you read, and how the articles or whatever you read remind you of your own experiences.    So, the point is, if you feel that you need to spend money on a book like this, perhaps you don't have the ability to discipline yourself into a steady routine of journaling and writing. Buying a book like this one will allow you to read some tips and eventually forget about it. After brief excitement and productivity, you'll be back to square one; with no self-discipline, you'll never apply this book to your life week-by-week as you should. It will collect dust next to your yoga books.  I offer this criticism not to sound nasty, but to make you think about what you are buying.   It's simple to buy a Men's Fitness magazine, for instance, but it won't help you unless you actually work out routinely. Same thing.   I guess the bottom line is that this book is okay for a casual read, but look it over in a bookstore first to see if you really want to pay the price of owning it.   I give it about 2.4 stars. 
 I do not understand why certain critics who are acquaintances of Mr. Lambert's have described this as an affectionate book about actress Natalie Wood. It is not a sympathetic portrait of Miss Wood' in fact, Mr. Lambert blames her for the tragic events in her life when she's not alive to defend herself. He also goes out of his way to attack her mother and her sister in what seems to be a personal vendetta while at the same time falsely glorifying rv actor Robert Wagner, who he admits is a long time friend of his. There would be no need to remember Miss Wood in a book at this time had she not drowned under suspicious circumstances that Mr. Wagner obviously wishes to conceal. It is clear that Mr. Lambert's true loyalty is to Robert Wagner, not to Natalie Wood 
 I've read only a few of Hillerman's previous Leaphorn/Chee novels. I've enjoyed what I've rtead, though they are an acquired taste, and I don't indulge in them very often. I tend to enjoy the earlier, more active years of Joe Leaphorn more interesting than his ' semi-retired unofficial advisor to Jim Chee' phase.   From what I gather, 'Skeleton Man' continues a recent trend of disappointment with Hillerman's last few novels. Even without having read the books immediately prior to this one, I can understand that sentiment. 'Skeleton Man' starts off with a rather risky premise, tying the story in with the real life collision over the Grand Canyon in 1956. While an author can occasionally pull off a good story with a strong connection to 'real life'(See Nelson De Mille's 'Night Fall'), Hillerman fails here. The story is bogged down with bland and unlikable supporting characters, flimsy motivation, and very little that could really be called 'action'. Chee ends up joining Leaphorn in the background for much of the story. The spiritual and ritualistic aspects of Hillerman's earlier books are, for the most part, glossed over here. Even what should have been a major plot development (Chee's wedding) is overshadowed by Chee have to rescue Manuelito, in the manner of far too many contrived 'Superman rescues Lois' situations.  Better to stick with Hillerman's earlier novels. The 'aging athlete past his prime' analogy suits Hillerman, I'm afraid 
 I'm not sure why all the other reviews seem to be so positive of the designs when my opinion is the complete opposite. I felt it important that I include my viewpoint. I requested this book from the library just so I could look it over first. The front cover looked cute, but it turns out I should have returned it immediately. Most of the designs (all clothing items) look to me like they should be draped over a table or be a lampshade. Other items would be fine if they were scaled down to about 1/4th the size they are presented in. The models look like they've shrunk under the enormous designs. One outfit looks like a giant doily took over the model's entire back. Basically what I'm saying is, I would never wear the items in this book. They look fun to crochet, but they're just not practical.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not normally one to give a negative review, so I feel kind of bad about this. I can see the positive in most things, but in this case I felt even the slightly so-so designs were tainted by being around the others 
 Very left anti-capitalism book. Contains no cogent arguments. Facts are skewed or are outright lies. Example: Page 56 states "The huge budget deficits during the Reagan years in the 1980s were due to tax cuts..." When , in fact, data from 'Budget of the United States Government: Historical Tables' show large increases in Government revenue during the years after the tax cuts. The increased deficits being due to large house/senate spending. Of course, in this book, Bill Clinton can do no wrong. Over all, this book is a very hard left leaning and biased work. I wish I could get my money back 
 As a Landscape Architect I found the book helpful and very simple to use and browse through.  It is a good resource.  It would be helpful to have some construction sections or details illustrating construction techniques.  Also having a resource guide in the back for manufacturers and supplies would be useful 
 I read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the "educated" aspect, Bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents).  I started into "In a Sunburned Country" with similar expectations, and especially since I have always longed and planned to visit Australia.  To state that I was disappointed is a severe understatement.  After reading this book I now have little to no desire to visit the "land down under;" my only hope is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson's book so that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!)  My best estimate is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about Australia.  During and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  I have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as I did with this one.  Bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a "story" relayed second-hand from one of the Australians he "met."  Such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books.  The only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  These, at least, provided for some interesting reading.  After comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of Bryson's books ("I'm A Stranger Here Myself") after she read "A Walk in the Woods," it would appear that "In a Sunburned Country" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has churned out.  Perhaps he isn't a "one hit wonder," but I for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out.  So, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided in "A Walk in the Woods," look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed.  
 This book is a total bore. Only a couple of pages that holds your attention. More talk about the scenery and walking naked through the woods. Don't waste your time 
 Haught succeeds in thoroughly confusing most readers not at a graduate level in theology. He randomly assembles quotes from prominent thinkers, but when all thrown together with his own beliefs and 'evidence' readers can expect to be frustrated. His arguments come off as depending more on his own beliefs than any true evidence. On and on and on he blabbers, often without any obvious purpose. Finally, 190 painful pages later he wraps up with a conclusion that essentially leaves us back where we stood upon starting chapter 2. I recommend waiting for the Hollywood movie version 
 I must disagree with the people who have given this book five stars. Like many of them, I believe Ben Hogan was - and is - the greatest technician the game has ever seen. This book is, however, a disappointment.   The book can be broadly divided into two sections. The first is an account of John Schlee's Maximum Golf school. It covers Tom Bertrand's work with Schlee,  Schlee's relationship with Hogan, and his use of Hogan's techniques in his teaching. The second section is a breakdown of Hogan's swing fundamentals, including points that he hit upon AFTER publishing his 'Five Lessons' book.  The first section of this book provided an opportunity for an in-depth look at John Schlee and Hogan. It can hardly be coincidence that Hogan, a very singular character, chose Schlee - an equally singular character - as one of the few to whom he confided the secrets of his life's work. A thorough examination of these two men, their characters, and the parallels between them, would have been fascinating. It may also have shed some light on the nature of the relationship between golf and character. (I can't think of another sport with such potential appeal to character traits like obsession, perfectionism, even masochism.) While this is, at the end of the day, an instruction book, I would have loved to have seen the authors try to shed some light on Hogan & Schlee's characters through their golf - their approach to the game, their methods, techniques, goals and systems. It would have greatly enriched the book. It could have even added some depth of understanding of the techniques themselves. Perhaps most importantly, such an attempt may have given dignity to, and acknowledged the memory of, John Schlee. He deserved a better hand than Life dealt him in his last years. This book does not do him justice.  The instructional section of the book is at best, adequate. Much is made by the authors of their "tracking Hogan's secret" chronologically - which is nothing more or less than a quick run through Hogan's writing and interviews as to what he revealed and when. This section is not illuminating for anyone with even a passing knowledge of Hogan. Lastly, the detail of the swing moves and fundamentals themselves are set out briefly, with photos as visual aids. While adequate, they lack the flavour, clarity and depth that Hogan, Herbert Warren Wind and (illustrator) Anthony Ravelli employed with such skill and care in Hogan's 'Five Lessons.'  In short, this book strikes me as a magazine article that has been padded out with the intention of cashing in on Hogan's mystique and the obsessive need that golfers have to tinker with their swings. It serves as a pedestrian, adequate piece of instruction, but it's a missed opportunity. It is poorly written and it lacks ambition. It could have, and should have, been so very much more 
 I agree with the reviewer who called it a "bogus treatise." I read this book after personally witnessing a remote viewing experiment (documented on my website). I did not read the whole book, only chapters 1-7 and 16 (I wasn't interested in debunking Uri Geller). Chapter 3 begins with a Robert Browning quote "...you'll find what you desire", I assume targeted at "believers" in the paranormal. But it equally applies to the authors. In their "replication" of Targ's remote viewing experiments the authors selected as the viewers a few students and a housewife who "believed themselves to be psychic to some degree." Of course, they did not believe in the existence of the phenomena they were testing -- otherwise they might have allowed themselves to make the assumption that it might require someone who practices. If you were testing "exceptional athletic abilities" would you select a subject who played softball once a year and "believed he was athletic to some degree" or would you select a professional athlete?  For remote viewing, you could select members of the Hawaii Remote Viewers' Guild, for example.  Their intent was not to study the phenomena using an open-minded scientific approach, but to "debunk" it - in the typical sarcastic style 
 In a nutshell: Don't waste your money on this version.  The original version of this translation dates to just after the turn of the century, but the introduction and further editing by Anatol Rapaport (a biologist and a musician, not a political scientist or historian), make this a clumsy read at best and downright misleading at worst.  Rapaport, for being an editor of Clausewitz, was not a believer in the trinitarian system (primordial violence, non-rational actions, and rationality)- probably not a good choice for a work which owes as much as it does to the first and second Trinities (army, people, and government).  If this is the only one you can get, then live with it.  The first chance you get, get the much clearer, much more straightforward Paret/Howard translation, which is the one that's actually taught at most service schools as well as in universities in their courses that use it 
 I am troubled by the deep levels of victim consciousness in this book.  How sad that Adrienne Rich, given the gift of three children, could remember little of the experience "except anxiety, physical weariness, anger, self blame, boredom and divisions within myself."  I feel pity not only for Rich but for the millions of women who suffer similar experiences and see no options other than checking out with depression or acting out through rage, both of which are counterproductive and generally treated with pharmaceutical drugs.  Clearly it's time for more empowering alternatives, starting with nutrition.  As a Clinical Nutritionist, I have seen many depressed and/or angry women dramatically improve their physical and mental health by giving up junk foods and so-called "health foods"in favor of  traditional foods rich in protein and fat. In other words, we must assert our right to eat the life-giving whole food gifts from Mother Nature, not the fractionated, packaged and dead food-like products built by Father Technology.  Although nutrition is but the first step, it will take well-fed women to tap into victor consciousness and to find creative ways to overcome the crippling obstacles, long-standing abuses and  self-destructive patterns that continue to incapacitate so many gifted women.        
 From a first-time macroeconomic student's point of view, this book sucked. The glossary was very poor making it troublesome to look up unfamiliar terms. Each chapter makes frequent reference to charts and graphs that are located several pages away, causing you to have to shuffle back and forth between pages, trying to decipher difficult new concepts. This book also assumes some prior knowledge of economic concepts, and moves very quickly through progressively more complex material. Thumbs down from a new student's perspective 
 A friend assured me that Pillars of Creation was the only stinker in this series to date. He was wrong. This is - by far - the worst book I've read up to this point.  A trilogy's first book isn't always the best. You lay out the rules, and set up the conflict. That's the way it goes. But the fact of the matter is that setting up the rules - and the conflict - didn't need to stretch on for 600+ paperback pages. Man, what a tedious book this was; if Richard wasn't reiterating his frustration in monologue, he was beating the same old dead horse with various characters.  I have a bachelor's degree in philosophy, and hadn't really taken issue with Mr. Goodkind's thinking until this book. Zedd's ramblings regarding contradiction and faith are ridiculously juvenile, and Goodkind did a startlingly wonderful job of making a wise character turn in to a stupid fool.  Here's to hoping Phantom isn't this burdensome.   
 The book has scientific value, but distorts findings to make  conclusions.   If you are searching to fulfill yourself spiritually, this is not a book for you.  You can make peace with your God, whichever religion, by simply listening to your soul...However, if you love pseudo-fiction sci-fi, eat this book up - its a buffet 
 i dont know why people like broken social scene, they are boring boring boring. i listned to this entire album and it was difficult. i wanted to turn it off really bad, but i had to go through it all to prove to myself that it is not good for anyone. for real though people, there is tons of music outthere that is not boring. you should check it out 
 I can't believe they would ruin perfectly good toilet paper on this. What's the world coming to 
 I agree with the other customers of this guide that there is no detail except for in a few spots at all. I mean what do you do after you defeat all of the  the elite 4? And when you walk up to a trainer his pokemon could stink or they might whip yours. So whatever you do DON'T by this guide. Please 
 I was very disappointed by this book. Not only was it painful to read, because it dragged on and was full of academic nonsense, the authors views were also unconvincing and based on old research.  This book is outdated and not relevant to the way Japan is today. The authors use a lot of research and examples from the 80s and even the 70s. They make the claim that Japanese firms experienced a lot of success in the late 70s and 80s because of their superior ability to "create knowledge." They seem to be in complete denial that Japan's economic bubble had anything to do with this "success" that they are talking about.  Also, the book was written over 10 years ago, before the financial crisis and before people realized that a lot of this so-called success was just cooked in the books by accountants.   They do give some reasonable examples of knowledge creating firms that are successful, but that's all they are, just a few examples and not an accurate representation of the whole picture of Japanese Management. Also, most of the examples are of Japanese manufacturing firms. What about the service sector? Suspiciously they did not use examples of companies from Japan's service sector, which are extremely inefficient and not the text book perfect examples of successful "knowledge creating" firms.   The theories and models in this book are a bunch of overly abstract vague pretentious academic nonsense. The real life examples are so nebulously related to the theories and models that most successful (or unsuccessful) companies can be used as examples.   If you want to read a bunch of nonsense based on old research with the names of Harvard professors and some philosophy thrown in to make the nonsense seem legit and intelligent, then by all means, read this book. But if you are like me and want to learn about Japanese management, don't waste your time or money on this book.  
 I have to agree with the many who did not like this book. I got it from the library and tried to read it, but couldn't get past the self-indulgent writing style. It almost seems like someone was too lazy to edit this book or make it readable for the reader. Any writer can put down stream-of-consciousness thoughts, but it takes hard work and effort to edit and revise with the reader in mind. A writer should want the reader to enjoy the process of reading a book. A book is written to express oneself, but also for the reader. Without the reader, the book is nothing.  
 I join the other reviewer who complained about the book having no code at all.  What a misleading title. The reason i came here to read the reviews is that i saw it on sale for just $10, and after going thru the pages found that it's not much use for a professional developer's day job 
 There are two particular problems here: First, music this minimalist needs lyrics that are incisive or clever or at least interesting in some way. These lyrics are consistently banal and in many cases inane. Second, McCartney's singing voice appears to be tired or ravaged by age or overuse. His lowest pitches (and none are THAT low) sound strained, and his higher pitches, which are mostly taken falsetto, sound thin and weak. His intonation is generally faulty; he is often painfully out of tune. Oddly enough, his singing seems to deteriorate as the record wears on, almost as if it had been recorded sequentially in one session, as I doubt it was.   There are chord relations in the first three songs (although only briefly in the first) that I never expected to find in a McCartney song. Possibly someone finally pointed out to McCartney that John Lennon's and George Harrison's Beatles songs were generally much more harmonically adventurous than his and he is seeking belatedly to even the score or possibly he is letting himself be influenced by David Bowie or by people who were themselves influenced by David Bowie. The opening of each stanza of "This Never Happened Before" ("I'm very sure/this never happened to me before") derives directly from Burt Bacharach, and McCartney unfortunately lacks the compositional technique to develop Bacharach's motive--or else he's too lazy to try. "A Certain Softness" is more or less reminiscent of Thomas Dolby's reading of "I Scare Myself" or perhaps of Brian Ferry going thirties-Latin. An otherwise pleasant-enough melody is destroyed by singing so out of tune on the critical last line of each verse that it is nearly impossible to tell what pitches were intended. "Follow Me" surrounds with filler some bits taken from George Harrison songs.  The best things about this record are Joby Talbot's tasteful, unobtrusive string arrangements and the remarkable clarity with which it has been recorded. There ought to be a law against letting McCartney touch a fipple flute, however. He murders the instrument on "English Tea" just as he once murdered it on "Fool on the Hill". The liner notes tend to be very specific--fussy, let's say--about instruments played, and although I think a "A Fine Line" one of the better songs, I'm a little saddened to learn the piano that McCartney is beating up here--banging out chords on--is an expensive, refined, and delicate Bosendorfer. Speaking of beatings, the booklet-back lengthy paragraph admonishing us not to make copies of this record (which I notice below is being blithly ignored) includes this sentence: "By [sic] carrying out any of these actions it [sic] has the same effect as stealing music." I don't know who is responsible for mangling the English language in this way, but I shouldn't be surprised to discover it to be the author of the lyrics on this disc; I find a stylistic consistency 
 I recieved this book after 3 weeks and I had actually buy the same book from the stores. Now I have 2 books of same kind. Very bad experience 
 Colbert loves the Lord, and that is plain.  His spiritual advice can be characterized by Philippians 4:13, and that is good advice.  However, his medical advice, in this book, is suspect.  The main point of the book, medically, is to understand insulin.  Although Colbert does describe this through several pages, the pages are very short and small, and we are not left with sufficient information to understand how his theory works, and on the surface, at least, it appears contradictory.  This review can not be long enough to explain my point, but let me point out some fairly obvious problems in other things he says.  On page 28 he says men should eat 4 ounces of meat at each meal.  His sample diets don't show this.  Further, in his other book, What Would Jesus Eat, on page 200 he says, "I do not recommend over 4 ounces of meat a day".  On page 29 of this book he says that men are to eat 4 ounces of "protein" at each meal.  He uses this term very loosely.  A slice of bread has protein, but probably not 4 ounces.  A piece of chocolate has protein, but probably not 4 ounces (unless it is a very large piece of chocolate).  By examining his sample diet we might guess that he really meant "4 ounces of certain high protein foods".  The samples show things such as fish, meat, poultry, cottage cheese, etc.  Some days you would eat meat at least twice, which he has warned against in other books.  In this book he recommends the use of various oils.  In What Would Jesus Eat he recommends only olive oil, and virgin or extra-virgin olive oil at that.  What's more, in What Would Jesus Eat he points out that the failure rate for diets is about 100%.  In that book he argues that only a changed lifestyle can sustain weight loss.  Which is the truth?  Since What Would Jesus Eat is a later book perhaps that reflects his latest thinking.  It is also a much better, more enjoyable book.  I recommend that book over this if you want to stick with Colbert, but better yet, look around for other authors and get a second opinion 
 I purchased this book because of the several glowing reviews of it on Amazon.  Now that I have a copy (which I will be returning shortly) I can only guess that those reviews were written by friends of the author. This book is little more but a long and rambling antidotal collection of PC repair stories roughly organized into general failing areas.  No symptom analysis, no error code explanations, no organized flowcharts of logical procedures, no tables of settings and types.  Just paragraph after paragraph of "if you notice this, try that".  In my mind this should be called something like the "Jeff Foxworthy you might be a redneck PC repair tech manual". However, if you are new to PC repair and have no idea where to start looking for the resolution of a problem, this MIGHT be just the book you need - because you can sit and thumb through it and look like you are doing something useful while you await the arrival of the guy who knows what he's doing.  You might even stumble on an antidote that actually applies to the problem you are currently experiencing 
 If you like whiteboy rap with terrible flow, this cd is for you. I loved "steal my sunshine" but the rest completely sucks. They arent even good rappers and thats the genre most prevailent here. Just buy the single 
 Samuel Jackson, Juliette Binoche...I thought it's gonna be a wonderful movie. To my greatest disappointment this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life.  A married mother with three children has an affair with a journalist and yet she's the one to fight for someone rights or to be compassionate about someone. What a non-sense!  Hope the greedy amateurs who created this movie WON some money with this crap movie by LOSING their chance to ever film again! Never ever I will watch a movie with Samuel L. Jackson or Juliette Binoche, again. I'm surprised how did they agree to star in this kind of "movie" that wastes your precious time 
 I never reveived this book.  The Nancy Drew came in the mail, but that is it.  Who do I need to contact????? 
 The Irish culture according to an an Englishman's perspective. Truth? Maybe some of it. Stereotypes? Yes 
 Perhaps the worst tribute DVD I have ever seen. Jump cut editing will give you ADD (we're talking literally two-second sound bytes!), the grabs are pointless with very few comedians talking about Pryor getting more than one sentence in before they jump to the next trendy talking head. None of them say anything funny or enlightening either, which is surprising for something that is supposed to be a comedy/tribute DVD.  A handful of Pryor clips from an existing concert (just one) and two short clips from the Richard Pryor show. The sycophantic background laughter at EVERYTHING their interviewees say (and I mean EVERYTHING, it's pathetic) is really grating.  And there's too many terrible comics on here - Margaret Cho, Cedric the Entertainer, George Wallace, Jamie Foxx and a bunch of sub-Martin Lawrence jarheads.  Spend your money on one of his live concert DVDs.  This is rubbish made by people who think they have a sense of humour.  It's a beer coaster. 
 I love technical material from an expert source.  But the writer has to be able to graphically communicate the information and show knowledge of more than just the topic of material.    For example, Carl Sagan (I miss him terribly) wrote some of the world's best books, arguing the real world against silly, false beliefs of deities, ghosts, and aliens. There are others too - including:  Shermer who have followed this style.   However, Sagan had such an amazing intelligence of such varied topics that he could have been an expert in just about anything: geology, religion, history, energy, military protocol - just to name a few.  Thus, his writing spoke to the lay reader.  Sagan shared his superior knowledge by teaching things that made a difference.  So, when he landed upon the specific topic of his books, he had the reader educated, impressed, and thoughtful of reality.   Shermer is missing the mark with his works.  He simply doesn't pull the reader in enough to solidify his full basis of discussion and arguments.  He knows his topic but drives it home, technically, so often that all other factors of thoughtful prose and emotion are unavailable to the reader. Therefore, the works end up like a textbook for an adult education, community center, philosophy class.   I bought this book after browsing the bookstore shelves searching for something to awaken my critical thought processes.  A few times each year, I attempt to purchase such topics as WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE WEIRD THINGS for the sake of educating myself further in the aspect of religious phooey.   While browsing, I read the cover, added a couple pages from the middle, and settled on the first chapter.   I was sold - primarily by the title.  My scans of the pages inside didn't really lock me into the purchase but I enjoyed the possibilities of the title and the subsequent chapter titles.  Thus, I bought it.  I was terrible excited about the read.  I wanted it to be good, if not great!  I gave the book several reads, intense sessions of focus and intrigue. Unfortunately, all of my attempts led to the same conclusion.  Shermer bored me.  I found myself drifting in thought.  Sure, I landed on a few interesting points but like a flash of light, as soon as I read further, hoping for something worthy of my time, I found nothing but drifting prologue discussion.  Boring!  It appears that Shermer is  indeed knowledgeable of the battle between belief and non-belief.  He has completed his research and does share it with the reader.  However, Shermer dictates the material to a point of it reading more like a manual than an intriguing work.    WHY PEOPLE BELEIVE WEIRD THINGS is written by a man who seems to be writing what Ticky-Tacky suburbanites want to read.  His work is flashy in titles and starts out with a credible amount of teasing validation but soon wanders off into a (let's show the world how much I know about this) non thought provoking work.    Unfortunately, I was desperately disappointed in this book and though I certainly tried it several times, I ended up failing to connect with it.  Recently, I fell upon another bounce of bad, literary luck. While again browsing for a new read, I landed upon the book WHY DARWIN MATTERS. Excellent title, and the chapters were interesting.  I flipped through and thought "Maybe there's something here."  I bought it.    Upon returning home and breaking the book open, I found myself locked into the first chapter.  Then, I suddenly found the material becoming uneventful and simply to mushy, with repetitive information that can be found in so many other sources.    Immediately I started to make a connection between how this book seemed so similar in style to WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE WEIRD THINGS.  I dug up the copy and sure enough...both are written by Shermer.  Needless to say, I didn't finish that book either.  No more Shermer for me.    
 After playing Doom 3 (the PC video game), I had high hopes for this movie. Oh well. The movie was disappointing. Were their monsters? Yup. Blood and guts? Yup. Swearing? Yup. Guns and special effects? Yup. But after playing the PC video game, the movie lacked a lot on storyline. And it didn't make me jump as much as the game. The movie is dark, but that's okay, since it was patterned after the video game, which is also dark (although the game was much more "playable"...with darkness...than the movie was "watchable"). The game was scarier too. This says a lot about the game creators (very well done), and the movie directors (poor effort). I'm not sure why Hollywood couldn't hack it. It might be okay as a rental (especially if you haven't played the game), but don't buy it. Honestly, the movie turned-out to be just another alien movie.  However, the game tells a very different story.. 
 About a year ago I submitted a review of this much-discussed volume, and promised to enlarge upon the subject after giving the regimen and medicaments a fair chance. Several kind souls have expressed their  appreciation for the original review, and asked for any new information I  might have about my person.  In the interest of science, and ridding myself  of the joys of arthritis, I have consumed cubic miles of chondroitin and  glucosamine sulfates; I have grazed upon greens; I have eschewed almost  every eatable, drinkable and smokable damned or even tut-tutted by the  authors - for a while, anyway. I still have arthritis. It does not have me.  If any improvement came about through this Spartan experience it could only  be detected by the most powerful instruments in the known universe. I shall  not, in future, invest in any more of the pills; I have just celebrated my  freedom with a beefsteak, which we discussed over a capital Hermitage, and  topped off with about an acre of gooseberry pie. As I write this, I am  savouring a good cigar. I speak only for myself in this regard, for I note  other reviews and comments diametrically opposed. Well, everyone to their  own taste, as the old woman said when she kissed the cow. Probably I, a  skeptic from the cradle, lack the faith necessary to derive benefits;  perhaps my metabolism is not in tune with the free radicals, or whatever  they are, that do the work.  Pity, as I said before, that a true scientific  test was not conducted by the authors. As presented, 'The Arthritis Cure'  and its offspring give off a decided odour of snake-oil. Anecdotes are  entertaining. Data are convincing 
 Ted Dekker is a total "hit or miss" with me. I began my foray into his work with Thr3e and literally could not finish the book. But, assured by a friend I trusted, I gave him another shot and picked up Black. I was not disappointed. The day I finished Black, I got Red and the day I finished Red, I began White. I absolutely loved The Circle Trilogy, so you can imagine my eagerness when I discovered Showdown, which is roughly a continuation of the Trilogy, centering around the mysterious Books of History which bring written words into real life.  Showdown begins with promise, builds weakly, and putters to a pathetic end. Is there any action in Showdown? Plenty, I suppose. Actually, Showdown is a fairly gory and violent story. I would not recommend it to anyone under the age of maybe 15. If it were to be made into a movie as written, it would be rated "R", "PG-13" at the least.  The story is about a tiny, isolated town in Colorado. It literally has one grocery store, one church, one beauty shop, and once had a movie theater. The town of Paradise (such an awfully cliche' name, all things considered) has a population of about 400, but we only really get the feeling that it's populated by about twenty. The remaining population are only briefly referenced a few times, which skews the feel of the story, in my opinion.  The opening scene is pretty good, actually. Johnny Drake, a boy of about fourteen, is sitting with his old (very old) friend Cecil as a stranger decked out in what can only be described as a gunslinger's getup from a Clint Eastwood spaghetti western, strides into town on foot. Marsuvees Black is an outlaw prophet come to Paradise to bring the sleeping residents a message of "grace and hope" and to shake things up a little.  In the first few pages, Black murders 80 year old Cecil by scaring him into a heart attack and Johnny Drake is the only witness. From this point forward, young Johnny is the only person in Paradise who is able to resist the charms and deceptions Black brings to the town.  Beginning at the Episcopal church that night, Black calls a town meeting where he wows the people with a sleight-of-hand show that really gets everyone's attention. Who doesn't like to be entertained at church, after all? He openly challenges the pastor, Father Stanley Yordon, who leaves almost immediately the following day for a conference with the Bishop in Denver and does not return for several days. I was fully expecting Stanley to return and do something of consequence, but in all fairness to the story, he was absolutely useless as a character except that Dekker needed a church and a church needs a pastor. Well, and there's the affair with Johnny's mother, Sally. And their child. I won't spoil that should anyone reading this actually decide to read Showdown. Still, it really didn't add to the story.  After getting to very briefly (and shallowly) know the characters in Paradise, we move to a mysterious monastery where a group of orphans are attending a special school. In reality, they are the unknowing participants in a spiritual experiment organized by the headmaster, David Abraham (yes, just like Abraham in the Bible). It turns out that Marsuvees Black is one of the monks "teaching" the 37 or so students at the school. The students are taught primarily through writing. Everything centers around writing and for good reason: the mysterious blank Books of History we first hear about in The Circle Trilogy have appeared here. If you were perplexed by Dekker's ending in White, you will now solve the mystery of who Billy is. Billy is a thirteen or fourteen year old "orphaned" student at the seminary who is an exceptional thinker and writer.  In fact, his only real challenger is Samuel Abraham, the son of the headmaster.  We learn that there are forbidden tunnels under the monastery and that Billy has been tempted by Black to enter them where he discovers the blank Books of History. (The Books of History have he ability to create history based on whatever is written in them, so long as the writer has "the faith of a child", which, given the age of the children, was a bit unconvincing to me.  Whoever has seen a preteen who was filled with nothing more than angst and sarcasm?) Billy also discovers the giant worms (which are never really explained) that live in the tunnels and excrete a hallucinogenic sludge that seems to help blind him to the evil lurking about. In time, Billy begins to coerce his friends to visit the forbidden tunnels, which finally leads to a "debate" (one of the many "showdowns" of the book and just about the weakest "debate" I've ever read), resulting in a drastic change in the way the monastery operates. A majority of the students follow Billy down into the dungeons and are conscripted into helping him write his story. A story about an evil prophet who visits a sleepy little town called Paradise, Colorado...  I won't belabor on with more details, except to point out that the story is just incredibly weak. The characters are extremely shallow and the circumstances are just too unbelievable, even as a supernatural fantasy/thriller. Dekker does a poor job creating characters you care about, which is surprising because he did such a good job of that very thing in The Circle Trilogy. Several characters are brutalized, some are murdered, and I found I just didn't care. I felt I was just reading words on a page (actually at the half way point of the book, I was seriously wondering whether I would even bother finishing it. It did get better after that point, but only just.)  One big problem I had was how unusually remote the town was.  It just didn't make sense when the phones went out and the power failed that SOMEBODY didn't notice.  Don't these folks have families?  If you live in a remote area, aren't there like REGULAR deliveries or some sort of near DAILY contact made?  What about law enforcement?  Heck, what about the MAIL?!  The central message of Showdown is actually very good and full of meaning to Christians. "Grace and Hope without Love is powerless." In the end, sacrificial love is what saves the day. But his way of telling the story--of illustrating the power of love--had no power. Young Samuel's selfless act in the end meant absolutely nothing because he had nothing invested and therefore, nothing risked; no real reason to give his life to save the people of Paradise (or his "dear friend" Johnny), and without that very important connection, it had virtually no meaning for me and therefore no power. Words on a page.  I felt I had been beat over the head with allegory instead of told a fascinating tale about characters I cared about and those wonderful blank books. I didn't even hate the villains! How can you not at least hate the villains?! Lack of good character development really hampered the story. Dekker does a passable job with dialog, although he has the fourteen year olds sounding like eight year olds at times, and like proper Victorian ladies at other times. Who winks anymore? If I see a fourteen year old kid winking at another kid, I'm calling the cops.  I also found his use of everyday language in the narration to be annoying.  It almost read like a fourteen year old had written it. Hmmm...  The biggest problem I had with the story is the way the extreme conflicts were resolved.  Far too trite and fatalistic, in my opinion.  There's just no tension without risk, and NO risk where fate is concerned.  Well, they were "fantastic" in a sense and would look cool on a movie screen (anybody see a pattern here?), but they just didn't make much sense. Dekker seems to draw out the story with a few "key" revelations that don't make sense, either.  Yes, the revelations themselves made sense, I guess, but why his characters kept them hidden until "everyone was ready" did not. It became clear that he needed to push the plot and stretch the story.  Big mistake, in my opinion.  It subtracted credibility from his characters and from him as an author.  As I said, I absolutely LOVED The Circle Trilogy (Black, Red, and White), but I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time reading Showdown. On a scale of one to five, I rate it a solid two. (Hey, at least I finished it! I couldn't finish Thr3e!)  It's obvious Ted Dekker is a good writer from The Circle Trilogy.  Why he didn't put those same skills to use in Showdown is the biggest mystery of all 
 I've been looking forward to this album for quite some time, and man, what a bummer that this is what I've been waiting for.  After several listens, I still can't find even one song worth putting on a mix cd.  Come on, guys, you can do better than this 
 This is my first book by this author, and I honestly feel like I might like the story after-the-fact, if the author didn't ruin all the punchlines in the book. The fact that he felt the need to explain away every twist in the plot made me feel like I was being beat over the head with a "Did you get it?" stick. I also thought he was over-doing the fairytale theme, with the swirly chapter pages and obligatory detail that had zero quirks 
 Vanishing Voices does a good job of showing how larger languages are destroying smaller ones, and the methods of language death.  This is all pretty much common knowledge.  However, the authors fail in their attempt to give a reason as to WHY language death is something with which we should be concerned.  The only argument they put forth is in a ecological/enviromental analogy, which says that biological diversity is good and stable, therefore, linguistic diversity must.  However, they only go part way in their analogy and reject natural selection for languages.  They also show that linguistic diversity corresponds to environmental diversity, but state this has nothing to do with the inexcessiblity of the areas.  The violin-playing and loaded words are hard to stomach if you are looking for good social science.  I would not suggest the book unless you are an ecological activist wanting to try to link your cause with "saving cultures" or with yet another critique of the West 
 Firstly, I am not a Britney basher.  In this review, I am not attacking the person, namely Britney Spears (like a lot of reviewers whose remarks should be removed).  I own all her full cds - the imports becasue they have extra songs/mixes.  I own nearly all her singles and remixes including the Pepsi song.  Ok now for the review.  It is not the fact that this song is similar to Toxic that is bad.  It is the lyrics that bring this down hard!  The first time I listened to this it was grating.  The second time I turned it off around where she sang "give me a guitar so I can look like a star"  or something like that.  As for the music, it is cheesy pop rock that may have worked for something else but together with these dismal lyrics made for an experiment gone terribly wrong.  While I will admit that her interpretation of "I Love Rock n' Roll" was a bad idea, at least it was listenable.  This "Do Something" song is not even that.  So Britney I did Do Something, unfortunately it was not good....I turned off the cd!  If it was a single,   I would have broken it!  What?!! "No helpful votes"?!!!  Come on!  I like Britney Spears and own everything by her except this.  WORST SONG EVER!!!!  
 I bought this book with the hope of understanding what my wife might be going through, so that she need not travel this road alone. I am a doctoral candidate in a medical facility and have had several publications in scientific journals as well as peer-reviewed numerous others. Reviewing material objectively is something I have done extensively. This book describes thought processes of people having mid-life issues and addresses only one solution as being viable; go YOUR own way, do YOUR own thing, YOU are right, YOU are the most important thing in the world. If this is all there is for Vickers-Willis to offer, no wonder her marriage failed! There is no room in any marriage for just the I and the ME; it is a partnership between the spouses and children. If the husband just did what he wants to, it would be considered selfish and self-centered, but Vickers-Willis seems to send the message (several illustrations) in her book that it would be "self-preservation" for women to do it. The second half of life can be as profound, meaningful and rich (as the author suggests it can) as the first or maybe even more, if husbands and wives are encouraged to find some common-ground to compromise on, that way the family continuity and memories are maintained, and just as importantly, each person's self-esteem. Walking away, and convincing yourself YOU are always right is just TOO easy; where are the other options? Put yourself in the other person's shoes! Sorry, this book is incomplete at best because it hasn't presented the picture of the forest, only several trees within it. How can one solve a problem without getting a big picture? The situation may have been defused but the problem was far from being solved. The 1 star is only for the effort put into the book.  
 it blows my mind that there are so many ecstatic reviews for this movie. It is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. bar none. i felt physically ill at the end of it. i guess there are parts of it that could have been interesting in the hands of a good writer and/or director but unfortunately Miranda july is neither. she cannot write her way out of a paper bag. some people mentioned the sexual content w/children. those parts were for lack of a better word "icky" yes. i'm no prude though and its not as if I object to a filmmaker exploring those topics, its just that they were extremely poorly written and acted in my mind. every part of the movie seemed stiff, stilted and artificial to me. let me put a caveat here. i don't mind slow movies, small movies, introspective movies, offbeat movies or anything along those lines(see "eternal sunshine of the spotless mind" a simply brilliant movie). this movie was simply execrable in every phase, writing , directing, acting). It occurs to me though what the dividing line might be between those who love this movie and those who hate it. ( there are very few between it seems ) In the movie and in real life Miranda July is a "performance artist". in the movie she has a crummy "installation" which is not recognized by an art curator ( who pays for this grievous oversight in the form of sexual humiliation ). A person who thinks this kindergarten level installation is some kind of overlooked masterpiece that deserves attention will like this movie. one who thinks of it as pretentious and artificial will not. count me amongst the latter. despite all the plaudits and huzzas for this film take my word for it. the emperor has no clothes 
 Information you already know, mixed with the same retro style as a dozen other books you can buy more cheaply. YAWN 
 What the ----.  "A tale of revenge"?  Why does everyone in their review say that?  B/c it's written on the box cover??  This is an interesting and compelling movie, but w/ a very odd, abrupt ending that leaves you hitting the "REWIND" button and saying, "what a minute, is it OVER??  Did I miss something??"  Afte watching this, I scoured the internet, Wikipeida, and Amazon...still no reviewer seems able to say what was meant by the ending of this film.  My takeaway on it -- she is going to hang, and die (go to heaven);  he is going to stay on Earth..but maybe when they meet again (heaven), they can get married.  ??  ????  How come no one else can come up w/ a definitive meaning to the end of this film?  Subtlety is great, but not if it's so damn ambiguous that NOBODY in the universe seems to be able to define or explain what this film was all about.  It was NOT about revenge.  Maybe it was about love and obsession and sadness and the silliness of despair.   Sorry, can't really recommend this one! 
 Were it not for Eminem's diatribes of the hood and a handful of curious Detroiter's (former and current), I can't imagine what interest this book would hold for anyone.  I know the area Clemens speaks of and it is nothing short of amazing that he has so little to write about that is interesting.  I suspect that the author was an "academic-in-waiting" from his earliest years and that the sounds and heat of the street were a little too dangerous for his sensitive soul.  I will give him credit for being a decent writer, though.  Furthermore, claims by a number of reviewers that Mr. Clemens is racist are pure politically correct nonsense.  It is more likely the case that the author is guilty of being white and a bit naive 
 I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories.  This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing.  There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult.  I felt like I was in the "fog of war", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end.  Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?  
 I had quite high hopes for this little kit given the phenomenal Dragonology. However, it is genuinely disappointing. The kit includes a nice plastic talisman with crystal, a package of dragon powder, a dragon rune decoder and a small 2 inch x 2 inch book of spells. For the suggested retail of $8.99, it's pretty overpriced, and the items are small enough that one wonders why they weren't incorporated into the Dragonology books in the first place. Surely with three books, filled with secret compartments, one could have found space for these 
 The extendable arm breaks very easily.  I had two of them and they both broke within the first month.  The company does have a 3 month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and I have been waiting over a month for my replacement.  Very poor product.  Do not buy 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 I was excited to find a book filled with fun, fresh summer ideas but one look inside and I was so disappointed. The premise of the book is fresh, easy meals that appeal in those lazy summer days and nights yet the book is filled with not terribly interesting, not terribly difficult but very fussy meals. Who needs that in the summer? and who needs this book -- certainly not me 
 I had to find out who is tormenting me over the cable radio they play at the gym.  It's this band.  Please make it stop.  If your favorite band is featured on "The OC" it's time to start thinking for yourself. 
 If your looking for practical advise on renovating, this isn't it. It's full of antedotal stories of renovations gone wrong and right, but isn't a guide to renovating...more like a book of short stories. By the end of it you'll know more about the writer and his family and friends than you will about renovating. A waste of time 
 The book tells us little about Shakespeare himself. Rather, it is a chronicle of Elizabethan times in England. We learn more about his contemporaries, e.g. Johnson, than we do about Shakespeare. There is even more information in the book that touches on the physical layout of the Globe Theater than the playwrite. The book is, however, a fairly concise, yet informative listing of his plays 
 I bought this book to learn about switching power supplies. The types are not dicussed. The formulas given to calculate inductor values generate results that contradict each other and don't make sense. Reads like a poorly written application note 
 I love the title--it's worthy of one of the funniest, most intelligent people I have ever met only one time (that would be Kinky--I had the priviledge of meeting him at a book signing in NYC).  I love Kinky Friedman.  Were I a female, I would probably consider compromising my virture for a vigorous roll in the hay with him but paradoxically, I really hated this book. It's not the worst book I ever read but it's one of those books where you read for 15 pages and suddenly become aware that some significant event has occurred but you were so bored you didn't even notice.  Out of my loyalty to the Kinkster, of whom I have been a fan since the Jewboy days, I read the book to the end but once I closed the book, I felt like I had to shower to remove the overpowering odor of the mildewy plot.   Speaking of the Jewboys, I wish Kinky's sidekick Jewford would write a book. That boy's funny. 
 That should have been the title of the book. I was really disappointed. There was very little about Grace O'Mally, and more about what she did on her vacation.  I really didn't care why she changed her name or where she stayed or that she got sick and couldn't go row-boating. I just wanted to know about women's roles at sea, which she did cover a bit, but she could have done in a 100 page paperback instead 
 Wow. This book is well-researched and has much worth-while information. But, oh, my. I've never read a book (and I've read many) with such frustrating invasions of the author's personal--for lack of a better word--wit. Here are two examples that I read yesterday. These were within the same paragraph:   [their lifestyles were similiar, including overeating] "thus, like whales in a pod . . .,"   [The kings sanity would come and go over the years but for now he became sane] "like a kidney stone, this too passed."  Over and over and over again, these inane "witticisms," trite and overused expressions, and etc. kick me out of the biography, which could be stirring and should be powerful.   very frustrating 
 Maybe something got lost in translation but I think the wording and the sentences uttered by Ka and others seemed as if they were written by 5th graders.  I couldn't imagine people talking like this.  I forced myself to finish the book but the wording just "hurt my ears".  I read it based on the New York Times basically saying it was a great book.  This was not a great book, but maybe the translation was just bad??  Also, I am not sure if the author meant it or not but I got the impression from the writing and story that Turkish people aren't that bright.  It seemed to me he was putting down the muslim religion.  Anyway, that was minor, the writing was just bad, bad, bad. If you want to read stories that flow and wording that is like music to your ears (even though translated) read works by Naguib Mahfouz, especially The Cairo Trilogy. Now that is good stuff! 
 The box says you can turn on the motor, toss it like a paper airplane and it will fly, fly, fly while you steer it with a radio controller.  The plane is made of styrofoam with some "reinforcing tape" (read cheap thin shipping tape).  What it does: Nose dives, explode into pieces while the motor keeps running.  If you want to spend an hour putting it together, then have a disappointing experience watching your project explode, this is THE toy for you 
 As a general practitioner, I don't recommend this book for professionals who want to improve in advanced knowledge in physiology. It is a STARTER book on the theme, for medical students only, not for practicising doctors.  I've got frustrated 
 The title intrigued.  The book . . . not really a book but a group of essays, one of which provided the title . . . disappointed.  Spending ten pages of fine print on the exact definition of a word left me a bit angry -- angry that I do not have the courage to toss a book that I have paid for and started to read 
 I was disappointed in this book. I expected a well thought out, easy to understand description. The author starts out defining some terms, but omits others, and then describes things using undefined terms. By his initial definitions, one thinks "Good, this author doesn't assume I understand all the terms he will be using." Yet in the rest of the text he clearly considers that the reader knows a fair amount about boats and the terms used to describe them. Some drawings are missing important labels, and some explainations referring to drawings are missing important details, with a result that one is sometimes left perplexed. The book struck me as a quick gloss over of boat design with too much detail for someone in need of the grand overview. I don't think it had detail for someone actually interested in learning more about boat design. Someone interested in the quick basics would do better with other general sailing texts where simple principles of boat design are covered. Not sure what a better, more detailed text would be 
 Nicole Kidman gives an absolutely lifeless performance as the interpreter of the title in this curiously flat Sidney Pollack film. THE INTERPRETER is unique as it is the only film ever shot on location inside the United Nations building in New York.   Kidman plays Sylvia Broome, a minority White expatriate from a politically torn racially-mixed African nation. Members of her family have died due to the violence in her native land, and other friends and relatives who have remained behind are backing one or another contender for the Presidency of the fictional country. Kidman becomes the centerpiece of a massive international investigation after she ovehears discussion of an assassination plot against the despotic President, who is scheduled to address the United Nations. Sean Penn plays the govenment agent who is assigned to simultaneously protect Kidman, foil the plot, and find out what she really knows and where she really stands.  THE INTERPRETER has all the elements to make up a grand espionage drama, but Pollack and the all-star cast fail to ignite this film. THE INTERPRETER should have worked but it doesn't, leaving it the sort of film that cries out for a remake the day shooting wraps. The story plods along at an elephantine pace; the willowy Kidman is too morally ambiguous to gain the audience's sympathy; Sean Penn is convincing but cranky. No one seems to speak over a murmur even at the most dramatic moments. The contrivance of a fictional country is far too quaint for the world-is-the-size-of-a-grape 21st century. In the end, the requisite suspense simply never builds, leaving THE INTERPRETER an intelligent, well-made, well-acted, and supremely boring film.  
 Any sword that is only $15 is in fact very dangerous. These swords are called wallhangers because they are only designed to by hung on a wall, not swung. The reason is that underneath the handle is a very small piece of metal that connects to the blade itself. (Called the Tang) In a real martial arts sword, the tang is normally a thick piece of metal that is almost the thickness of the sword itself. If you swing a wallhanger too often or too hard it can break at the tang, and fly off and hurt someone.  If you want to learn more about how dangerous these wallhangers are do a google search on the words: anatomy of a wallhanger  Any sword designed for real martial arts practice- like Iaido, starts at $250 not $15, and should be bought at a reputable Iaido store. (sorry I am not allowed to recommend web sites here).  So be smart, either hang this sword back on the wall, or throw it out before your baby brother/sister hurts someone 
 This is a soap opera that either wants to be literature, or was marketed as literature. It's a romance novel. Many people over a period of many years fall in love, get married, have affairs, grow up, grow old, and have children of their own. Though the characters are scientists, their crushes and affairs are no different from any others' (the book jacket says it's about "inner lives of smart people"). Regrets are a large part of their lives, though only one or two characters are well-drawn enough to be interesting and induce sympathy, and they have a terrible habit of not taking action when they can and want to. Large editing problems render this clearly a first novel, though I give it two stars for the apparent effort put into it 
 While I agree with the author that hormone balance is essential to good health and well being, I have to take exception to the "estrogen dominance" theory. The author is clearly a disciple of Dr. John Lee and his bogus theory of estrogen dominance. I was a victim of this rubbish until my problem was diagnosed as estrogen deficiency. As any woman going through menopause will tell you, there is no such animal as "estrogen dominance" and the perpetuation of this nonsense is the cause of much misery. A much better book on female hormone replacement is "Natural Hormone Balance" by Uzzi Reiss 
 I received the router and tried to install it. I got up to the point where the router was to verify the connection and I lost my internet connection. I then found out that it deleted my IP address. Called Belkin tech support with a sad result. Bottom line is that I lost My IP address 3 times. Had to go to my server to restore it each time. Belkin tech support needs to be recycled. Talked to 12 repres. with no success. Will return this junk in a new box 
 Ms Moore undoubtedly knows how to write a clever turn of phrase.  But she seems far too consciously self conscious and wears her jaded view of life like a personal crown of thorns.  Some of the stories were passably entertaining, but strangely forgettable.  Most of them, however were numbingly cynical and self absorbed.  I tried to read this book (based on wildly enthusiastic reviews at the time) back when it was published in 1998.  I never finished it.  This year I ran into it on my bookshelf again, and wondered if I'd read it; and if so, why didn't I remember it?  There was a bookmark still in it...about three or four stories in.  So...why couldn't I remember anything about it?  I started reading it again...and nothing came to mind.  I had absolutely no recollection of any of the stories I'd apparently read in 1998.  I made it to the 10th story this time, and once again...I put the book back on the shelf.  This time I enclosed a note to not bother with it again.  I sincerely hope that most people do not view life as presented in this book, and I ardently hope most people aren't as flawed and unbalanced as Ms Moore seems to view them. While there are moments of humor, I fail to see goose genocide as amusing. That is just one example of what I saw as cynicism run amok. I attempted to re-read this book only two weeks ago.  I just went and got it back down to write this review...and to my surprise...once AGAIN..I'd already forgotten most of every story.  What a waste.     
 What was to be the perfect bookcase for the space came in a box that was battered and torn.  It looked as if it had been dropped from a plane!  The entire bottom shelf was cracked in half and all the hardware bent out of shape.  I would really like to own this bookcase, but I want it delivered in usable condition 
 Generally harmless, except for one very offensive song about siblings that hate each other and hate their parents.  The song is probably funny to ultra-sophisticated, cynical adults.  But the song is totally inappropriate for a four year old.  I wouldn't bring this CD into your house 
 There is so much wrong with this book its hard to put it in a short review.  Let me keep it objective and give just a few of the many, many inaccuracies that fill its pages.  First, this pompous tome refers to the movie "When Worlds Collide" as being based on the pulp fiction of the 1930's, when as everyone else knows it was based on the acclaimed novel of the same name by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer (the book is not even mentioned in the description of this classic film).  Another example of a clear disconnect with the material it claims as subject is the entry which describes the milieu of the film "Silent Running" as being in the "throes of a post-apocalyptic nightmare"  ruled by an authoritarian government.  This movie never makes reference to any such thing.  In fact the society is described by some of the characters as being idyllic.  But for me the last straw was the entry describing one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made,"The Thing from Another World".  It states that the movie is set in Antarctica, when actually it is (again, as the rest of us know) set in the Arctic (North Pole).  The entry then goes on to tell us that the researchers "thaw" the flying saucer when they accidentally blow it up, and that the Thing is found in the saucer (after it was thawed, of course), not in the ice.  My advice is that if you have not bought this book, don't!  If you have, throw it away.  It is worse than no good.  This book gives the term Encyclopedia a bad name. 
 This book should have been called Northern California Camping rather than California Camping.  I started reading reviews about places up north, and it gives plenty of descriptions and commentary.  They're much longer than the ones in Los Angeles.  I don't think he's camped down here.  Just compiled a list of campsites here. Also, his rating scale is very questionable. One campground I know to be a virtual parking lot, he gave a 9 out of 10 rating for. I should have bought a different book. This book will be helpful if I decide to take a camping trip up north.  otherwise, thumbs down :( 
 I have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more. The language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words. These books can cause you embaesment, since I read where ever I have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it. Please we would all like to see more of these 
 they may have some good info, but i was flipping through this in my local bookstore, and most of what they have is a whole lotta ads... and within the ads a lot of scams and MLM schemes.  buyer beware. : 
 I purchased this Boombox over a year and a half ago.  What I do like about is that it was hard to find a boombox with a remote and Mp3 playback.  I agree that it could have been better.  It would be nice to be able to rewind from the first to the last.  You cannot rewind/fast forward in the song in Mp3 format but you can do it with a regular audio cd. sometimes I like to hear a certain portion of a song again, but I will have to play the entire song again. I no longer have the remote and there are some things that I cannot do anymore.  
 Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
 We were greatly disappointed in this travel guide since the information was out-of-date.  We spent a great deal of time locating a highly rated and recommended restaurant only to find that it had closed years ago.  Other recommended restaurants also did not meet the expectations according to the review criteria.  We tossed the book aside and relied on recommendations of the locals 
 I've read all but three of the DS9 novels so far (12 total, I think) and I can say that without a doubt, this is by far the WORST novel I've read in the entire series. For those who ever tried to defend Trek novels as actually having literary merit, David Mack decided to make a shallow mockery of us.   Do you remember in third grade how teachers tried to tell you that you should use as many adjectives as possible in your stories? This guy took that lesson way too far. Every word must have it's own melodramatic adjective. Unimaginative phrases like "a wind as cold as death" are littered all over this book. I found myself having to skip over entire paragraphs of melodramatic descriptions that weren't even relevent to the story. In one instance, he goes so far as to compare a Klingon ship to a Christmas tree... And I don't even want to begin to go into the horrors of his descriptions of the celestial temple. Where did this guy learn to write?  To his credit, he writes action scenes fairly well. It's only when he gets into one of his 'descriptive moods' that we find ourselves wondering if this guy just sits at his desk with a list of adjectives and then tries to throw them into his sentences after they've been written.  Read the book if you want to keep reading the DS9 series, but don't read for entertainment value. You will be sorely disappointed. 
 I was intrigued by the title, so I purchased the book "Study is Hard Work."  Unfortunately, the book did not live up to my expectations.  There were not enough methods on HOW to accomplish what you need to  succeed.  There were certainly parts of it that were useful, but the  majority contained no "Aha" moments or insightful clues as to how  to get the most out of a subject.  If it were reorganized or contained more  diagrams or descriptions of how to study for each particular subject, it  would be better.  -L 
 I was excited to read Jedi Trial because it is the first of the Clone Wars novel to feature Anakin as a central character. I was sorely disappointed upon reading the book, however. It doesn't have the feel of other great Star Wars books and the authors are pretty poor writers in my opinion. The book is lacking much of a plot development and the dialogue and characters are both very wooden and lacking substance.  While the book claims to be about Anakin, I found that I was let down by the abysmal portrayal of him through the book and it was fairly obvious that the authors weren't too familiar with the Star Wars saga and shouldn't have been invited into its wonderful expanded universe 
 This series is the worse batch of nonsensical brutality I have ever come across. The writing is poor and the theme (such as it is) is unbelievable. A complete waste of time and money. I did not pass the books along, I deposited them in the garbage can.  Advice to the author: Go back to writing school 
 This documentary is poorly produced, has terrible sound quality and stereotypical "life affirming" stories.  There was nothing in here to support Wal-Mart, their business practices or their philosophy 
 This book is not so much about intercultural relationships or movies. It is about pets, pet-obsession, abscesses, tumors, infections and revolting habits of said pets. Not two pages go on without at least a mention of the annoying creatures. The characters are all pretty stereotypical and their behavior is repetitive and predictable. A couple of interesting situations are stretched out incredibly thin. And the pets take on the scene again. Priceless: the "Dali" Lama typo. A big disappointment 
 Altho the 747 was a mouthful... it left a bad taste in my mouth.  I needed a light read... too bad the oxygen masks did not operate... maybe some literary talent could have been breathed into this book.  
 There are quite a few unforgivable mistakes...They highlight one of the most important formulas on a page and the formula is WRONG... The answers at the end of the book are so wrong that will confuse you. The authers should proofread the book much more carefully 
 I'm a huge James Patterson fan, and I purchased this book without reading any reviews.  Oh, what a mistake that was!  The writing was choppy, the sentence structure hard to follow, and the story line bland.  This definitely does NOT compare to his later works 
 This book is really one of the worst books on economics I've ever read. First, the conceptual approach of comparing economic systems is a joke - how useful is a dyadic system if ALL cases to be explored end up in one of the categories? Second, the book lacks any reference to the ongoing discussion about "new comparative economics" or neoinstitutionalism - both tools that could be very helpful to compare economic systems. The author either does not know these discourses or chose to ignore them. Third, the "analytical" results presented in this book are nothing more than the usual general prejudices about economic systems. The "overviews" over certain countries are a collection of platitudes which are really breathtaking in their oversimplification. Fourth, the style of writing is bad. Fifth, I have no idea why this mediocre book is so expensive 
 How can you know that you are really, really famous? One strong hint would be that people are willing--even happy--to pay good money for a reprint of your old emails. On that criterion, and based on the cheerful other reviews, Larry Niven is really, really famous.  Don't get me wrong; on my shelves are 22 books with Niven's name on the spine. But this one is a shoddy collection of castoffs, cobbled together not (I hope) by Niven himself, but by some marketing droid desperate to have some more Niven "product" to sell. It contains four actual stories totalling 100pp; the rest is trivial filler, including the above-mentioned printout of emails.  Those might be of interest to a PhD candidate in English writing a thesis on"Collaborative Methods In Science Fiction of the 1990s" -- but they are really for the wanna-be SF writer who wants to fantasize that he or she is among the lucky handful who actually get to collaborate with Larry Niven. In fact the emails are no more interesting than email between you and your co-workers. There's no writerly advice from Larry to his pals, no "here's the golden secret of good plotting." You could read a megabyte of such email and be not one adverb closer to publication of your work.  The rest of the trivia includes brief, uninteresting excerpts from novels; old, short, and dated essays; a report on a trip to an SF Con; a brief intro to someone else's book; and fragments of the "canon" (i.e. notes) on the milieu of the Man-Kzin Wars.  This stuff is just sweepings from the writer's office floor. They show you nothing of Niven's imagination or plotting skills. Their content would have near-zero interest but for the fact that they were not swept up from your office floor, but from Larry Niven's.  The editing is shoddy as well. There's no publication information at all (no citations for published items, no dates for unpublished ones). There's just no way to tell what has been published before, nor where. For example, half of the 100pp of actual fiction is a story, "Procrustes," but there's no hint that it was previously published as part of Crashlander (Ballantine, 1994). The lack of this data makes the book irritating to read (ok, when WAS this Intercon he reports on?), and useless as scholarly source material.  This book is for the library of an obsessive Niven completist collector. Ordinary readers will do well to save their $7 
 After a couple of articles written about the same period of Tarantino's carreer (which was very short so far when this book was published) I got a strogn sense of de-ja-vu. It's basically the same questions and answers all over again, and the book only slowly goes forward to the next film or project.  I guess a book like this would be much more interesting if the filmmaker had done a lot more films and the book could do with only 1 or 2 interviews per period. This one was written too soon, alas 
 I read up to chapter twenty (about 300 pages) and stopped reading the book, realizing I had more important things to read.  My major complaints are (1) that there is too much discussion of the Mozart family finances, which I'm sure would be fascinating to economists and accountants, however tedious to someone concerned about music; and (2) too much retroactive Freudian analysis of the subject, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  Think about this:  Solomon uses an obsolete, and now debunked, system of psychoanalysis to describe a subject that cannot be interviewed.  The best discussion of music is concerning the Salzburg serenade style in chapter eight.  Other than that brief section (pp. 125-133), I was not impressed.  Short of reading Mozart's letters and making your own analysis, I recommend Stanley Sadie's "Mozart: The Early Years, 1756-1781" for starters.    
 The very concept of this book is deeply offensive to anyone who values freedom of speech and thought, or good writing.  Don't these people realize that they are engaging in intentional brainwashing?  You can't change reality by changing the words; you have to change it by changing the reality.  Resist these intellectual totalitarians at every opportunity!  Use (and treasure) precise, vigorous language, eschew emasculated, politically correct twaddle 
 This cd sucks! Nobody can sing! Andrea McCardle is a horrible annie. Reid Shelton is the worst Daddy Warbucks Ever. Bert Healy sucks too. I Hate This Cd. Please Don't buy this, I'ts Horrible! It's A Humiliation To The Musical Annie! I'm 16, and I Grew Up with Aileen Quinn as Annie. Alicia Morton is The Best Annie. If you want a good Annie Cd, Buy The Television soundtrack to Annie. Everybody on this cd Sucks 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 The Panasonic is very compact, very stylish SEXY as my wife called it, but the photos are very disappointing: they are way to noisy! Even if set on the lowest ASA setting at 80ASA it is just barely acceptable and they do get progressively worse anything above 100ASA.  The colours are good, and it does take very good videos, but still photos are just plain bad when compared to other cameras in Photoshop CS2. Of course it is easy to understand why: the native resolution of the images. If one investigates such things, will notice that the Panasonic is only 72 dpi, same as Sony's, Canon improves this to 180, and Nikon is at 300 dpi. It is not just about megapixels folks, but how those megapixels are recorded and at what resolution. Obviously a camera with 72 dpi will have more noise than one at 180 or 300 dpi.   So before you buy any digital camera or thinking about upgrading to a newer model, do yourself a favour. Try 4 or 5 cameras in the same megapixel range at a good camera store by taking photos of the same subject in the same light condition. Set the camera for the lowest ASA and the highest picture quality in JPG format, take the photos, pop the SD card  into the computer, compare the images in Photoshop. Enlarge to full pixel size (100%), and and look at the meta data at the same time and you will see for yourself. That is what I did, since I was not very happy with the images my Panasonic produced! I had this camera for 11 months and 20 days exactly, and today I traded it in on a Nikon P5000 after evaluating over a dozen models including the Leica D-lux3 10MP camera, and driving the sales persons crazy with all the testing and spending 4 hours at the store, but it was very educational for them too 
 I've been a Vampire Chronicle lover since I read The Vampire Lestat and have followed closely every single new Vampire Chronicles. I don't usually buy hardcover, but in my eagerness to read, I even bought the hardcover version, as soon as it's release; However, I must say that I'm really disappointed in the two latest chronicles, Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle.  I am no language professor or writer. I don't read to analyze/dissect the novel or anything like that. I read just for pleasure. I don't care if there's inconsistencies or some other small problems or strangeness in the novel. I only look to be able to share and enjoy the adventures with the heroes; to be drawn into the story. However, I feel alienated from the heroes. They seemed so aloof. There seemed to be no real passion in the story. I don't understand what's missing. I so terribly want to enjoy and like the books 
 I picture Chomsky in a sunless, cluttered apartment full of scattered yellowing newspapers, surrounded only by walls of his own clippings.  Yes, his recent writing is the result of too little exposure to the real world.  Not everything is a conspiracy theory, and not all facts or events paint an overall trend or picture.  The world is too random for all similar events to be related.  But when you surround yourself with your own highlighted facts of history and dwell on them day after day trying to sell your thoughts, the result is going to be nonsense.  I respect Chomsky's right to say what he thinks, and as a liberal I often find myself agreeing with him (but for vastly different reasons).  What I do not respect are those readers who take his words as gospel, when they are simply the rantings and ravings of someone who has lost touch with how the real world works.  Throwing together a bunch of events across history does not make for a lucid view of how we got to the present and what to do about the current problems.  To me, he is no different from those who have assembled enough disjointed evidence as to convince themselves that 9-11 was perpetrated by the U.S. government.  I am not excusing the actions of any U.S. administration, past or present.  All that I am saying is that the actions of the U.S. 10, 20, even 50 years ago bear little relation to each other or to the present.  And where they do, it is not worth arguing that it is the result of some long-term phenomenon of evil U.S. power.  The world is comprised of random actors interacting constantly, and to say that the U.S. should be able to control or foresee the future is nonsense.  All the U.S. can do is preserve and fight for its own interests, which is all that any state does.   Chomsky's anti-capitalist, anti-globalization, anti-aggression stance is based on an ill-conceived vision of a utopia, one far distanced from the real world in which we live.  In Chomsky's world, it is possible for everyone to get along in a state of equality, and no interests ever conflict.  In the real world, interests do conflict, and equality is impossible without sacrificing absolute welfare.  While I often disagree with the chosen approach to resolving those conflicts, I at least accept that the conflict needed resolution and that doing so presented difficulties beyond the ability of a human mind to conceive.  Sometimes we get it right, sometimes we don't.  But it is only a fool who would take all of the failures and weave together a story of evil intentions.  That Chavez would brandish Chomsky's book while ranting and raving about good and evil on the floor of the U.N. shows just what company Chomsky's theories find for him.  Chomsky's theories could use less lofty language and more grounding on planet earth.  It is no wonder that half of the evidence provided cannot be backed up with verifiable sources 
 I was very disheartened after beginning to read this book.  I was learning bridge and got more and more confused the more I read this book.  I do play bridge now but not because of any help from this book.  I looked for help in others books.  This is not a book for someone who is looking to learn bridge 
 First of all, I have to give this collection at least 2 stars because it is RATT after all and there are some great tunes here. But in general, the Essentials series sucks. They try to put the big over-played radio tunes and leave out killer album cuts and fan favourites. They only have two tracks from Dancing Unvercover, my favourite Ratt release. The material from Detonator is the slow ballad crap and not the really high energy stuff. What a disappointment. Do yourself a favor and buy Dancing Undercover. If you still don't like Ratt after listening to that album, you never will 
 This is a strangely disappointing book.  I guess I expected some clear connection with Adolf Hitler, some bit of evidence or conjecture that would make the man more of a creature like us.  Instead, Mailer has seized on the old rumors about his family, his father, incest, and has drawn a picture that suggests the damage Hitler may (must) have suffered as a child.  It is in short Mailer's imagination we are dealing with here, and his alone.  There is nothing here for the historian, and perhaps that was my mistake.  I was thinking historical fiction when I began reading it.  There is virtually nothing of history present in the work.  And worse, we learn nothing new about Hitler.  A disappointment 
 This was my first time reading a Jodi Picoult book and I really don't think I will attempt another one.  The Plain Truth was painfully long, boring and repetitive.  Every character was annoying and unbelievable - especially Ellie and Katie ( the main two). I kept waiting for a great twist with the ghost of Hannah but it never came.  Just some added supernatural of no revelance thrown in.  The beginning is the only part of the book I found interesting....It went downhill ( extremely slowly) after that.     
 The McQueen car went first. Motor sounds worked but no voice and rear wheel activation. This, after about two weeks of play.  Then the King car stopped working. Same thing, no voice or rear wheel activation. The cars that came with the Shake 'N Go race track are holding up but go through the batterys. The cars have a tough plastic shell and alot of thought has gone into the details. One gets the impression of a quality toy when handeling it and they look good just sitting still. But, that is not what we get them for. 
 I had the TomTom Go 510 for about 5 days before I decided to return it.  Overall, the user interface is great, and very easy to understand and configure.  The setup was easy, and I also thought that the windshield suction-cup mount worked well, which I know a lot of other people complained about.  The items that led me to return the unit are as follows: 1) Bluetooth hands free- the clarity on this wasn't bad on my end, but the anyone I talked to on the other end of the phone couldn't hear me well.  I had the external mic on my visor, so it was probably no more than 2 feet from my mouth.  Unless I was holding it in front of my mouth, the connection wasn't clear.  I also had problems where my Motorola RAZR V3 would simply disconnect from the TomTom for no reason, or send a call straight to voicemail rather than letting it ring through the TomTom. 2) The Point of Interest database is lacking.  I had read this in other articles, but didn't believe it could be that bad.  I was wrong! Basically, when it comes to restaurants, it only contains fast food, and aside from that, anything retail related is lacking.    If you are just looking for navigation where you aren't relying on POIs and don't need hands free calling, this unit would work fine...but then again, without those features you could get something much cheaper that would get the job done!  Overall, this product is not worth the money 
 I must admit that this book really mystifies me.  There is no doubt that Ms. Bank is a talented writer, and there are many observations and characterizations that are vivid and humorous and ring true.  But overall, the novel just left me cold.  In thinking about it, I've come up with several issues.  First of all, who really cares about Sophie?  She just seems to have some missing pieces, and it's not really clear why.  She doesn't really seem to be able to engage in satisfactory work, relationships, friendships, and I can't figure out whether she lacks intelligence, sensitivity, and/or judgement.  But as a result, I really don't care much about what happens to her. Second, and more important, what the heck does happen to her?  The novel moves around in a way that makes me almost think it was written as a series of short stories.  You read all about her relationship, for example, with Neal, and then the next chapter arrives and we don't even know what happened.  Maybe I need more closure than Ms. Bank is prepared to offer and it's my problem.  But repeatedly, all of a sudden Sophie appears in a new job,or with a new boyfriend, or with new friends and I'm wondering - did I miss something?  Is this an abridged version or what? So that by the end, I have to ask - what's the point?  Has the main character grown, matured, been on a journey that has led somewhere, or what?  I was left feeling none of these, and thus pretty unsatisfied.  I just have to ask - why was the story of Sophie worth telling?  I have to answer - I don't think it was 
 How did this artist ever get this published? The artwork in this book is so amateurish I did not even want to read what he/she had to say. I don't want my pieces to look like theirs. It looked like junior high artwork. The proportions of animals were totally incorrect, color wasn't eye catching, pieces looked like crayon drawings. This must be self published. I returned the book I didn't even care that I lost my shipping costs, I would never look at it or read it again 
 Having several books on French style and French Country style, many showcasing homes in France, this book is a huge disappointment.  Few of the rooms are stylish, but rather, well just junky.  I was looking forward to another look at French style in France, not just the interpretation of such in America.  This is a coffee table book for those who have little design sense 
 Is this a book to help out women who suffer from being misinformed about menopause or an advertisement for progesterone cream?  Didn't help me at all, if anyone wants to buy it, it's yours but I don't recommend it 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
 Well, I am not financed by any right wing think tank (but if there's a think tank out there that wants to finance me--right or left--, give me a call!), but forty years ago Ehrlich was predicting massive global starvation in the 1990's.  Well, I went throught the 90's and I don't really recall that.  If you're looking for a scary but fictional story, read Steven King...or Paul Ehrlich I guess.  But let's not pretend that this has anything to do with reality.  
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 This book made me want to run to the bathroom with my hands covering my mouth. The plot is absurd, and epitomizes mediocre literature. Certainly wasn't a page turner, more of a page-flusher 
 Unless you think it's funny to watch a grown man scream at little children for an entire movie, I wouldn't recommend this 
 I have always enjoyed Rita Mae Brown's work. That being said, and yes, this  story line does wear abit thin, but the worst, unforgivable sin is that she read the story herself.  It was awful.  Several times she will start a sentence, only to stop and restart after a few words.  There was no feeling of character in her voice. Yoy can hear her swallow and clear her throat, so I guess it's the production values that are the biggest offender 
 As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher "Finnegans Wake" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.  I first tried reading "Finnegans Wake" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.  However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Dumas, "Les Miserables" by Hugo, "War and Peace" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, "Notes From the Underground," "Crime and Punishment,"  and "The Brothers Karamazov." These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.   In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.   Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. "Growth of the Soil", by Knut Hamsun, and "The Master and Margarita," by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over "Finnegans Wake" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as "Finnegans Wake" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece 
 Jay McInerney's collected magazine articles on wine, while entertaining, suffer from dilettantism and namedropping. With so many serious wine regions and vintners in the world today, persons with both a global, and a broad temporal perspective on wine are extremely rare. While McInerney never claims to have such encyclopedic knowledge, neither does he refrain from making sweeping conclusions that are, I think, often erroneous. He is at his best in these pieces uncovering some oft-forgotten region or maker, but these moments are routinely spoiled by his obsession with a very small handful of personalities and with luxury goods that have no relationship whatever to wine. As another reviewer has noted, there must be a dozen or more genuflections to Helen Turley-- one would think that she was the alpha and omega of California winemaking. The loving detail with which he describes the clothes of French or Italian vintners is just silly and irrelevant. My other pet peeves with the book are the nonsensical obsession with high end wines (really, do we need McInerney to tell us that some 60-year old first growth Bordeaux was nice? wouldn't the ink be better spent on wines that are actually affordable and delicious, as so many are these days?), and the shameful disregard of the many meritorious California sparkling wines. At the end of the book, one is left with the impression that wine, for McInerney, is just another status symbol, and not an integral part of dining 
 Children love to follow instructions, step by step, and this book has an over abundance of unnecessary and inefficient steps that can make a simple recipe that would normally take 20 minutes to prep, drag on for hours. Any adult, who cooks like this doesn't cook often, cooks professionally or spends most of their waking hours in a kitchen.  For example, who in a modern home kitchen cuts a stick of butter, melts it in a pan then pours it into a (plastic, microwave safe) mixing bowl? Great, now there's a pan, a knife and a cutting board to wash! It is a children's cookbook, so why not cut down on time spent with knives, stovetop flames and inevitable messes by just melting the uncut butter in the plastic mixing bowl with the microwave?    Nice pictures, large font, recipes are great, but (in my opinion) obviously written by someone working in a fully staffed professional kitchen, not a home.  
 This book is by far the worst proofed book I've ever read in my life. I can't believe I'm writing this as a review, because I can normally overlook a few typos. However, the typos in this book make for an almost impossible read. I can't believe I paid money for it 
 Purists will argue that once an author has died then his output has finished. Others will argue that there's no compelling reason not play in someone else's imaginary universe if there are good new stories to be told. Certainly there's a thriving market for new Sherlock Holmes stories. I myself don't mind a continuation novel or pastiche if it's well written and captures the flavour of the original.  This book fails on both counts for me. Ultimately this is just a mystery with robots in it. Without Asimov's name to spruik it I doubt most of us would bother picking it up. Tiedemann is not a bad author but this is dry, technical stuff for the most part. His characters aren't badly drawn and there's some mildly interesting discussion of new aspects of the Three Laws but there's long, dense passages of technobabble that simply beg to be skimmed.  Some will like the dense, convoluted conspiracy, I found it tedious.   Bottom line is I'm not inspired to read the other two books in the series, which about sums up my indifference to this one 
  Yes, this is the great PBBB 1st album (actually, the 2nd, see below), but it's not the CD you should be buying.  This domestic CD was released in 1990 and has never been remastered.    The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 2nd album "East West") is the one to get.  It was remastered by Bob Irwin in 2001.  Ditto for "Pigboy Crabshaw" & "In My Own Dream"; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered (and sounds incredible) and the domestic CD's are not.  Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery.  Don't waste your money on these inferior versions: Get the imports!  Also: Don't miss the "Original Lost Elektra Sessions" CD, which was the real first PBBB album, recorded before this one.  There is some fabulous music on that CD, and the liner notes by Paul Rothchild are worth the price alone 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be. They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body. Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first. A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects. Some don't make it out the other side. I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone. Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones. I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too. Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 First I liked this press - good coffee, reasonable price.  But in 3 weeks operation, the press itself has already broken. The plastic holder for mesh filter has broken... May be this pres is good for ones a year usage, but not for everyday... 
 When I first picked up this book, I was hoping for more of an objective look, via interviews, at what kind of person the far-right "white power" movement attracts, and also why they are attracted to the movement.  Unfortunately, while Ezekiel does provide some of that insight, it is too often tainted by his own opinions.  He goes to great lengths to disparage these people and the movement.  While I don't condone the movement at all, I was hoping for more of an objective look at it.  Various techniques used by Ezekiel include responding to the arguments and comments of the interviewee within the context of the book.  For instance, they will make some remark about Jews always feeling sorry for themselves.  Rather than respond in the interview, Ezekiel will add his rebuttal into the book itself, after the interview, thereby denying the chance for the person to respond.  Also, using the same example, Ezekiel will criticize a member for their stereotypical remarks, and then include a line in the book to the effect of, "I don't think Jews feel sorry for themselves.  I think we actually are very empathetic."  In both his use of the word, "we", and attributing empathy to all Jewish people, he is doing exactly what the interviewee did---namely, attributing one characteristic to an entire group of people.  But because it's a compliment and Ezekiel is Jewish, he feels that it's alright that he speak for an entire people.  I felt some of the book was worthwhile, especially his look at the background of the people that he interviewed, allowing for a better look at what may be the draw for these people to the movement.  But due to the various flaws I mentioned above, I don't feel that the book wasn't so much a portrait of the racist mind, but a subjective look at people who I couldn't help but feel Ezekiel set up in order to arrive at his preconceived notions 
 I bought this great piece of crap about a year ago.  When I first used it, I followed the directions as indicated on the box.  Worked fair the first time, I mean I could have just used my dads power washer but no, I am a pioneer and want to try new things.  So then I used it about 6 months later to detail a neighbors car and it left SCUM EVERYWHERE!  This wasn't your ordinary scum, this stuff was hard to get off the car.  I spent a solid day scrubing the car to get this SCUM off the car.  So I swore I wouldn't use it after all that happend.  So today I decided to wash my car because I'm moving to Arizona in a day.  I used the power washer with a new bottle of Mr. Clean soap. I mean hey...what would go wrong....MORE OF THAT SCUM, so here I am now spending my day rubbing the scum off at least the windows instead of packing up the car...anyway you all know my feelings on this product.  Mr. Clean makes quality products but screwed up somewhere with this one 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 Don't believe the hype.  This book is not a masterpiece, but if you are able to stick through the piles of metaphorical images that are at moments beautiful but most often don't quite make sense together and make it to the end of this novel you'll be pleased to find some actual action and true emotion in Justine.  It took me a very long time to read through the first half of this book.  The narrator is irritatingly affected and the writing drags with a myriad of descriptions that are uneffective at creating a cohesive picture.  But what kept me going were Durrell's secondary characters.  He has a nack for capturing and creating quirkiness that borders on bizarre and his stories of the more minor men and women in Justine are striking, emotional, and entertaining.  I am glad that I was able to make it to the end of the novel (there is a hospital scene that made it all worth while), but I do regret that I recommended this novel to my bookgroup and I do not plan to complete the quartet 
 Even though I have never heard of this author, I bought the book because it looked interesting enough.  However, this book was not worth the discounted price that I paid for it.  Clearly the author is working on the side of the racist crackpots out there and is not looking at the reality of the border situation.  He seems to have spent some time with the fringe border vigilante-militia types and has obviously sided with them.  We need a serious book about the border situation as is today and unfortunately this one isn't it 
 I have never saw the original Nikita merely because its hard to find. I settled with the American remake as a last resort insted. It can't be that bad its got a few legendary actors in it like Gabriel Byrne, Harvey Keitel & Anne Bancroft in it. Not to mention my childhood dream woman Bridget Fonda. Damn is she sexy. But boy was I so wrong.  Anyways, the film is very violent for all the wrong reasons. Has swearing for all the wrong reasons. Even a drug addict like Fonda wouldn't mouth off everytime she opens her mouth. Thats not the girl I fell for. The pace is every sloppy. Its hard to believe how many holes in the screenplay there are for such a simple story. What is the major problem is its lack of plot. You just sit there after her missions not knowing what will happen. Its unpredicable in a bad way. There are no twists off any kind. I found the ending quite stupid. It seemed like an easy way out because the movie was almost at its 2 hour point. After the credits I felt dissapointed.  As for the actors. The beautiful Bridget Fonda puts in a good one in my book. Her blank stares are quite annoying but her sexy angry look works so well for this movie. Gabriel Byrne one of favourites puts in a kind but strict performance as he gradually becomes a father/kinda love interest figure to Fonda. Who wouldn't fall in love with her? The two work well together I'll give you that. R.I.P Anne Bancroft, forever Mrs. Robinson to me, is also scrict but very understanding to Fonda.Its also good to see her in films now that she passed away around 6 years ago I think. Finally Harvey Keitel, good in his early career is very dull at this point but since his playing a character who is dull and coldhearted, lets nothing get in his way, has no attachments and is plain evil works for this movie I guess. You see how generous I am to the actors. I could be mean to them for being in a so-so movie but I like them too much to say bad things about them. Oh did I mention I think Bridget Fonda is sexy 
 King certainly lends a high-profile to this collection of latter-day noir writing and tough-guy procedurals, but I believe he created something a little too far outside the readership's expected genre for this series. The setting and characters are recognizable (now trite?) staples of his beloved Maine coast, and he works at bringing their "down east" mannerisms to life with language that rings of "Bert & I" lobstermen. I wasn't particularly caught up in the aged newspapermen's tale of their quest to identify a mysterious dead man found on the local beach. And the ending ... well, um ... the ending is definitely an open-ender. King cleverly covers himself by adding a disclaimer of sorts that the story won't appeal to many readers. Yep. You got that right, Stephen. No gunplay, no boozers, no saucy dames, no double-crosses, no slangy patter, no real satisfaction for me. I suggest Hard Crime afficionados skip this entry and look to some of the heavy-hitters from the past 
 Sappy, wordless music performed by an orchestra does NOT a classical piece make.  Paul McCartney has no idea of what constitutes serious "classical" music.  He doesn't understand orchestration or use of time or timbre.   I always get a kick out of pop stars who have never studied music, nor can they   read, write or understand musical composition, but still believe that they're qualified to write serious music.  Even with the Beatles, it was the more musically astute George Martin who arranged the strings on Eleanor Rigby and others.  Paul couldn't tell the difference between a French horn and a tuba.  Standing Stone sounds like bad elevator music -- good for a soundtrack to a movie, sort of like "The Family Way" music that Paul put together in the 60's.  The melodies are trite and the orchestration lacks depth.  If one does not understand how composition works, one's music can only have so musical depth.  Come to think of it, even Paul's silly love songs lack any real deep meaning.  This is pretentious crap and should have been titled Standing STONED.  
 I am a bright student and have a GPA of 3.86. This book is completely useless for class. I reread the chapters and it simply does not make sense.  I found the internet to contain more useful information.  This book should not be used in any Introduction to Philosophy classes. It is much too complex. If you are attending classes at WIU, I would skip the purchase of this book and rely on the internet for your assignments 
 The English-Speaking world has badly needed a wide-ranging history of Christianity that focuses on the lives of ordinary Christians. Unfortunately, this need still goes unmet.  The contributors to the first two volumes of this series (the only ones I've looked at so far) often have mastered an impressive amount of factual material about earliest Christianity, mined from a variety of literary and non-literary sources. Unfortunately, they interpret this mass of data through the distorting lens of a couple of highly questionable theories - theories which they accept without examination, or even question. The result is that little of what they say about the topic is reliable or useful.  The older of these unquestioned theories is the famous 'Bauer Hypothesis', developed by the German historian Walter Bauer way back in the early 19th century.  Bauer argued that originally there were a multiplicity of competing "Christianities" - no one more correct or authentic than any other - and that it wasn't until after several centuries of struggle that what we know as "orthodox Christianity" finally triumphed, and then attempted to destroy all trace of its vanquished rivals.  This theory has become almost unquestioned "orthodoxy" (forgive the pun) in most academic circles, but few scholars have bothered to make a serious examination of its assumptions to see if they fits the facts.  Some scholars have, however, and one of them is the current Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who wrote an essay called "Does It Make Sense to Speak of pre-Nicene Orthodoxy" as his contribution to 'The Making of Orthodoxy: Essays in Honor of Henry Chadwick'. He seriously undermines Bauer's assumptions and makes a convincing case for a profound and intentional unity in faith and practice in earliest Christianity. I recommend you check it out.  The second theory governing this series is much more recent, but no more scrutinized. This is "Foucauldianism" - developed by late 20th century French deconstructionists, particularly Michel Foucault. It was Foucault's belief that all discourse (religious, political, philosophic, whatever) has one purpose - to help one person/group to exercise power and control over another.  Applying this attitude to Christianity, for example, has obvious results.  One will look at any theological statement about the Trinity, Christ, salvation or ascetical practice and wonder, "Who is trying to control and manipulate whom by teaching this."  For most of the contributing scholars, this plays out in perceived issues of class and gender. The Church fathers, who have been revered for centuries as teachers of Christian truth, are now seen as 'The Elite' who created "discourses" to maintain their power and exercise "discipline" on the masses. The masses, for their part, may have pretended to go along, but (these historians assure us) they were always creating "subversive interpretations" of the Elite's discourses, in an effort to undermine power structures and liberate themselves. As you can tell, this sort of rhetoric gets awefully tiresome after a while.  It is obvious to me that it will be impossible to make a fair or useful evaluation of orthodox Christian faith and life when all the evidence is selected and distorted so as to fit agendas such as these. I'm still waiting for that good social history of early Christianity.      
 This game looked so crazy I couldn't resist it.  I mean Disney and Squaresoft trying to merge Final Fantasy and a load of Disney cartoons must have seemed like a cool idea in Japan since they love cartoons so much, but in the USA it's just insane.  On top of that you have voice talents from Mandy Moore to Lance Bass, and as production values go you knew you had to be in for one of most ridiculous games in history.   Hardcore fans were bothered that this looked like a kids' game but aren't games supposed to be aimed at children and teens anyway?  I was ultimately disappointed with Kingdom Hearts.  The world and characters of Kingdom Hearts is not really about a Final Fantasy Disney crossover it's just a place for the kids you control to have out their little melodrama.  It's like the idea of Disney meets Final Fantasy just takes a back seat.  Once you get past all the hype Kingdom Hearts is boring and frustrating.  A nagging issue is the tiny areas in this game.  "Planet Alice in Wonderland" consists of four small rooms of course you will spend a great deal of time in them fighting off monsters.  The combat is a blend of chaotic button mashing and watching your party members act like total fools until they die.  The worst of it is respawning monsters, you can't take a step without having to fight and re-fight hoards of shadow munchkins that you had just defeated.  Because of this you'll spend the majority of your money on healing items.  Bosses are a nightmare since they are hard to survive and take forever to kill (30 minutes is normal.)  Since combat is so simple it really makes the drawn out battles beyond boring.  After beating 2 bosses I was done with this game.  I know that Kingdom Hearts 2, Mushashi Samurai Legend, and Final Fantasy 13 all have the same combat woes.  I wish Squaresoft would learn that respawning enemies and bosses with 9 million hit points are a thing of the past 
 Using the Color Wonder Finger Paints is basically like dipping your hand in Vaseline.  It's greasy, hard to wash off, and stains.  I would never buy this again nor for anyone else.  I strongly urge against purchasing this product.  Crayola, shame on you 
 I generally like David Sedaris; in fact he's one of my favorites. But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me 
 The last Star Wars novel I read that was based on a video game was the excellent "Republic Commando: Hard Contact" by Karen Traviss.  I had hopes that "The Ruins of Dantooine" could be nearly as good as the Traviss novel, but it wasn't to be.  "The Ruins of Dantooine" felt somewhat like a video game and it just wasn't very good.  The story was fairly simple and quest orientated and wasn't nearly as engaging as it could have been.    The Empire learns that a Rebel Holocron has been left on the planet Dantooine.  The holocron contains a full list of all of the Rebel Alliance spies within the Empire.  If it falls into the hands of the Empire it could effectively crush the ability of the Rebellion to operate.  Everything would be compromised.  The Empire sends one of their spies to recover the holocron.  The Alliance sends Finn Darktrin to locate the holocron before the Empire finds it.  An Empire biologist, Dusque Mistflier, somehow gets mixed up into the search for the holocron and assists Finn as Dusque becomes more and more disillusioned with the realities of the Empire.    This book just wasn't very interesting.  The story itself is quite basic and followed a video game structure with missions and a boss battle.  While the chance to explore Dantooine, and a post Prequel Trilogy Naboo was potentially interesting, the overall experience was weak and lacking.  The one good thing here is that there is no need to have played the game to understand the story, but I can only hope that the game was better than this book.  It was a nice effort, but the only reason to read this book is to read every Star Wars book published.  That's about it.    -Joe Sherr 
 Well after purchasing Neaderthin I do have to admit that at least my wallet lost weight.  I digested this Neaderthal treatise over several hours and was left with severe intellectual hunger pangs.  Save your money, anyone who wants my edition can have it for postage (you pay the postage, first come, first serve).  Good grief, what a  waste of time and money!  Well at least learn from my mistake and save yourselves. Don't bother with it, the premise is foolish and the proof merely anecdotal tripe supported by bootstraped deductions.  Be sensible, consume something sensible...perhaps Covert Bailey, among the dozens of worthy authors currently available 
 Had hoped for much more... it's the type of book that sets up the conflict for 200 pages, massages it for 60 more, and then resolves it in only 10!!  VERY unsatisfying ending 
 repetative, dull, poorly written, and really dumb. As other reviewers note, it is tough to find anything in here that you don't already know...probably even if you have never owned a cat. And if you think that you will learn Cat Speak, whatever that is, don't hold your breath, the entire section is less than a chapter, and the chapters aren't much. . My sister gave this to me, thinking that it would help us with our two cats. Use it for litter. 
 I am a Type B and Dr. D'Adamo tells me to eat more dairy.  I have never been able to digest any dairy products of any kind and he's telling me to eat them.  I have IBS and if I even dare to eat dairy then I am sick all day long.  What he says, I should be a Type AB then.  I agree with other reviewers, don't eat fast foods, soda or junk foods and eat healthy nutritious meals with exercise and you'll lose weight 
 The author, Crank, isn't a cop!  It's obvious from his writing that he doesn't understand police culture at all.  While there are some interesting observations made in this book, they are the observations of an academic who has studied cops---and who doesn't understand what we go through on a daily basis.  I wouldn't waste my money on this one.  Just my honest opinion 
 Unfortunately, Letters from the Hive is full of missteps, primarily because the author trips over his own ego. The factual information is sound, but the parts that read as a travelogue are peppered with too many examples of Buchmann's attempts to amaze us with his own daring. Since most of those instances involve culinary adventures (eating bee grubs) rather than those that involve physical prowess, it's not time for Indiana Jones to move over just yet. The whole thing reads more as a love letter to himself than the bees he proports love. Does anyone really care that he is a "Bona fide Tucson chile head and proud of it?" What does that have to do with bees? If you really want to read about bees and not the "Bee Guy," try Holley Bishop's book.  It is much stronger 
 Being a Saudi Arabian woman, I was totally amazed by the false information in this book. I don't think the author should write a book about a country when she lived there for few months. She missinterpreted so many things that happen regularly in our culture. She should know that women in Saudi Arabia choose to cover up. They are not forced to do so. The same thing goes to Catholic nuns, who choose to cover up for the sake of God. I think she should have talked to more educated Saudi women who could explain things better. She may have lived in a village where the majority were uneducated (that was in 1970's) and women were less fortunate. I'm currently working as an IT consultant in a huge company, my mother is a college professor and my father is really supportive and is proud of both of us. Nothing is stopping us from reaching our goals. I think people should look at a broader picture. I could have judged Americans by the acts of the KKK few decades ago. However, I lived in the US for two years with my husband, who is an engineer, and I had a chance to make good American friends. I cannot say all Americans are racists!! In concolusion, the book is a total waste of money. I do not recommend that anyone should buy it 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 I'm sorry, but this book did not hold my attention.  I am a nursing student and a total medical junky, but found this book unable to stimulate me intellectually.  Maybe I am just too pickey (highly likely).  It is not a poorly written book by any means, but I am a person who thrives on books which stimulate my critical thinking abilities, and, frankly, this just didn't cut it.  Couldn't rouse myself to finish the book...sorry 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 We are currently using this book in my digital logic class and it is confusing.  All my class mates agree that this book is terrible and we get little out of it.  His explainations leave you saying ???What??? and there are no solutions to the odd numbered problems, a basic requirement for a text.  We are learning soley from the lectures and other students who have some experience with boolean algebra and truth tables.  The other reviewers that like his book must be friends of the author. If your college has chosen this text... Pray you have a good instructor!!! 
 Since I got RSI myself, I've read a number of books on the subject, and of all I've read, this book was at the bottom of the barrel. I'm not saying it is completely without merits, but most of the good advice are available in  all other books I've read. I do, however, fail to see advice about  meditation and guided imagery as relevant to RSI 
 I enjoyed this once, as a student, then I grew up. Some books, the magic lasts forever. This doesn't 
 Plot falls together nicely, but one can easily figure the culprit with a little concentration.  If one can get over the musical theme which is played incessantly over and over and over... one might be inclined to rate the film higher.  I couldn't and won't.   
 I'm getting a little concerned about this review system because people are clearly misusing it and reports of abuse have gone ignored.  I am no fan of Bill O'Reilly and this novel is not the greatest, but there is no excuse for intentionally misstating the content of a book or using this space as a soapbox for irrelevant opinions...especially if, from the looks of some of these reviews, a reviewer have not actually read this book.  We need to set our opinions and agendas about the author aside and review the book on its own merits.    RE: a previous reviewer's statement that "under aged kids are being molested in this book by sicko [...]".  The character in question was a villain who briefly appeared -- a young ghetto dealer who was having sex with a 15-year-old when the hero/vice cop apprehended him.  In fact, O'Reilly is so busy preaching and pontificating in this scene that he forgets he is supposed to be telling a story: "Obviously, he preferred oral sex to oral hygiene."    That's the main problem with the novel.  He doesn't understand how a story is told, and it doesn't appear that his editor exercised too much control over easily correctable gaffes.  He interrupts an arrest scene with a comment in parentheses: "Homicide detectives are required to wear suits on duty".  You get the picture.  The details are not horribly original, but nothing is stolen outright that I can pinpoint.  And some scenes and subplots were actually funny.  I have a feeling it could have been a good novel with a decent amount of editing and advice.     There is nothing gratuitous, [...], or intentionally [...] in this book.  It is just mediocre -- but I did stick with it to the very end.  If you like media-related mysteries or O'Reilly, check it out of the library like I did.  Fulfilling my curiosity about what kind of story someone with his background would tell was worth a few hours of my time.     
 If you're new to the postmodernism question, then this book isn't for you. Better to start someplace else. And if you been looking at postmodernism for a while now, you've probably already read other, more extensive works by the authors of this volume, so you don't need to read this book either. So basically, there's no good reason to read this book.  And if you were going to read it, you would have a hard time because of the way its laid out design-wise. Being postmodern and all, Zondervan tried to design the inside of this book as "with-it" as they could. Unfortunately, while I enjoy postmodern book covers, when that same style is applied to the insides of a book it can make for some very tedious reading. Much of the text is printed as a light shade of gray using an italic font, which, as any graphic designer reading this review will tell you, is a big no-no. It just makes for hard reading.  Oh, and future editions of this work should edit out Fredica Mathewes-Green's attemps at humorous commentary throughout Horton's piece.  Cheers 
 I pre-ordered this on December 10. It was going to be a gift. I recevied an email this morning stating my order needed to be revised. I checked it out and it stated that the set would not be available until after Christmas. So I canceled my order. I found out from a friend that he had ordered it yesterday and received it today. Anyway, I ordered it from A&E TV. Also, NOBODY at Amazon could explain to me what happened 
 I enjoyed The Illuminator, however, like some other reviewers had problems with it. While not a middle ages expert, even my novice eye was attracted to absurd name choices. My MAIN concern is this book parallels Anya Seton's Katherine so much that I TRULY felt uncomfortable. While John of Gaunt and Julian of Norich are real historical figures their "voice" in The Illuminator too closely paralled Seton's. About a fourth of the way through the book, I desperately checked the Acknowlegements section for credit to Seton and Katherine- none was given! It almost seems as if a copy of Katherine was at the elbow of this author. Basically, the illuminator IS Katherine, but told from a different point of view. As one reviewer noted, names seem either ubsurd or "ripped off" i.e Rebekka (Ivanhoe) and Kathryn (Katherine). Perhaps someone should check into this....again, I did enjoy the book, but since I had just read Katherine before The Illuminator I was consistently distracted by the TOO many similarities. 
 Why is this? Why are Arabic instruction books sooooo atrocious? There is sufficient demand for Arabic now and sufficient research in language education to come up with something better. What a sad testament that Al Kitaab is actually the standard in university-level Arabic instruction! It makes me want to rip my hair out. Somebody, anybody, PLEASE publish a decent Arabic instruction text. And, for all you publishers out there doing colloquial Arabic: EGYPTIAN!!  A third of all Arabs are Egyptian and it's the only dialect universally understood by other Arabs. So please quit with all the Lebanese, Saudi, Iraqi, Jordnaian colluquial courses until there is a decent Egyptian course available 
 This book is basically hardcore porn in writing. There is no plot or story line just sex on every page. It is trashy and depicts sex in the most untasteful manner. 
 If it would be possible to give this product 0 or even below zero stars, I would. I tried to shorten my beard with the trimmer today and the only thing it did was to pluck out some hair and stop when more there were more than 4 hairs to cut at once. I did not even try the battery powered second option, because those are usually worse than the ones with an outlet. Anyway, I would never buy this product, because even $19 is too much for this 
 Since the main tenet of the Priory of Scion as proposed in "Holy Blood Holy Grail" and novelized in "The Da Vinci Code" has been effectively discredited, I was intent on sticking to real proto-Christian scholarship like that of Bart Ehrman and Ahmed Osman, but since the authors indicated that they had a true Sang Real/Royal Blood descendant as a source implying an actual interview, I gave this book a chance. There is little detail from the interviews with "Michael" in which he was to "verify some of [the authors] allegations". He apparently did not provide the authors with any documentary evidence to support his claims. Instead the authors mostly tell us what other alternative authors got correct and incorrect, which only really amounts to more presumption and conjecture. I tried to find some means to correspond with the authors but they are as unavailable to us as their source. You can learn what these and other authors say about Rex Deus through Wikipedia.com. 
 Nothing in here we didn't already know. For example: the government offers free information. Join a travel club to get discounts. It wasn't even aimed at seniors. One of the worst books ever. Save your money 
 Are you kidding me? Thomas the Train is fun for kids but no fun for adults. These are the most grossly overpriced kids toys around! I recommend Veggie Tales products or anything made by the Japanese toy company "Maisto. 
 After watching Blue Collar Comedy Tour (The Movie) many times, I was disappointed with the book.  I'm a huge fan of bill Engvall's Here's Your Sign segment on the movie, but the book just wasn't the same.  It's funnier on TV when you can hear Bill Engvall's voice, and the audience reaction.  The jokes in the book just weren't that funny, partially because they weren't delivered live.  I did enjoy the segments with personal stories, as opposed to Here's Your Sign jokes.  The personal jokes were very funny, and I laughed a lot.  This book is one you'll kind of have to flip through...reading it straight through gets boring 
 I agree with one of the other reviewers who found this biographer cold and unsympathetic. I'd go further and say this is the worst type of academic writing; a lot of facts and documentation are brought out, but the writer simply isn't talented enough to give it vitality. Instead of attempting some sort of personel interpretation of Zelda's life, Milford gives us overlong plot summaries of Zelda's fiction. No analysis! Just the facts! She treats the deaths of both the Fitzgeralds with the compassion of a coroner. People with Nancy Milford's limited abilities shouldn't be writing biograpies. The reader is given a depressing work on a talented artist, and  wounded soul, that passes on no understanding, no sympathy, and no appreciation. How horribly bleak. 
 i have not read the book bought have seen the video sick sick si 
 This CD was devoid of any of Govi's usual emotional imprint or soaring guitar work. Frankly, it was just a bunch of New Age background noise that one would hear on elevators. Some of the Craig Chaquico-style stuff was interesting, but better left to Craig. Try 7th Heaven, Mosaico or Guitar Odyssey instead 
 Allright, listen:  I will break it down for you country simple.  There is very little actual literature in the world and most of that is not recognized as such.  Why?  Because most of the people who set themselves up as arbiters of literary art have no discernment and bad intellectual character and so are easily bamboozled by writing that reflects to them their own dishonesty and narcissism.  Cobroc McGonigle, or whatever his name is, is one of the writers who will be ballyhooed to the skies by the taste frauds who cannot tell what makes good writing and what makes bad writing.  They just can't tell the difference.  And so they are suckered by pretentious, narcissistic phrase-making and word molesting.  Like for example inventing new words like "candleflame"  And churning out lots of copy.  With pretentious and asinine titles like "All the Pretty Horses."  This is the kind of title a teenager with no talent for writing should have come up with in the process of getting an F in high school creative writing.  Basically, the same people who cannot see through William Fakener will be unable to see through Comrod McDougal, only more so.  William Fakener may as well have been reincarnated as Copran McViegle.  He wrote the exact same type of tripe, complete with pretentious, meaningless titles like "Intruder in the Dust."  You intrude in any dust lately?  Oh, I forgot, I'm just not with it enough to swing with the hip literary fast set.  You know, the fast set that is composed of (not "comprised" of , that is a pretentious mis-usage) middle-aged women with vague but rather humble pretentions to art appreciation who join and promulgate book clubs.  They know they're too dumb to "get" why this stuff is so great.  What they don't know is they are actually smart enough to see that the emperor has no clothes.  
 If you think that two girly retards acting dumb and getting fired everyday is funny hit "no".  If you think that this sucks hit "yes".  Thus says The Metal Master 92.. 
 This study guide is rife with errors. Even if someone were to give you the book at no cost, you should still not read it. It does more harm than good 
 Painfully bad.  I want my money back.  Listen to Bob's albums, but stay far away from this movie.  So many great actors, but the story is nonsense.  The characters are just a random assortment of stereotypes.  Unnatural dialogue.  Poorly lit.  Poorly directed.  Poorly edited.  And Bob couldn't act his way out of a paper bag.  Stone-faced, frail, semi-catatonic; completely devoid of charisma.  It's his vanity project, but he comes off looking ridiculous.  Even his musical performances are only so-so.  The movie was shot entirely inside a Hollywood studio (except for a few 2nd unit shots of downtown LA), making it look fake and crowded.  A case in point: Jeff Bridges and John Goodman.  Amazing together in The Big Lebowski.  Both appear here as flat, irritating, one-dimensional characters.    It's a bummer, man 
 This man is another example of our over-affluent society's attempt to distract itself from existential angst via the myth that we should all be happy and feel good. Deepak Chopra has grown very rich catering to the alienation of misguided Marin County yuppies. Sleep is important, as is taking care of our bodies and minds, but do we need a smarmy swami to tell us this? Basic common sense (drink a lot of water...) is sugar-coated in pseudo-spiritual jargon, insulting the intelligence of anyone other than self-help-junkies and cult-bait. Can't sleep? Use the 17 bucks to buy a real book, and read it in bed. Or buy a vibrator 
 This book was written in 1981 and, unfortunately, it hasn't aged well.  It is loaded with unfulfilled sky-is-falling, doom-and-gloom predictions that look pretty silly in retrospect. I have great respect for Foster's other books, but this one is in desperate need of a rewrite -- with a lot less agitprop and a lot more spirituality 
 While the author obviously has done an enormous amount of research on the Prinsendam fire and subsequent sinking, he has totally ignored any and all statements and accounts of the Prinsendam's crew members. I am sure that there would have been many that would like to put the record straight after 25 years. The author is relying too much on press articles and passenger interviews while the official inquiry results of the Dutch Shipping Inspectorate are barely mentioned  The book is also full of inaccuracies as to emergency operations on board a passenger ship.  For those readers interested in the disaster and rescue efforts as seen through the eyes of the rescue organizations involved, this book will be very entertaining.   
 This book is all about Melanie Thernstrom, and not much about Bibi Lee.    It's incredibly verbose, disjointed, and boring.  You could cut it down to a quarter of the size and probably not lose any essential facts.  But it would still be incredibly boring.    While I sympathize with Melanie's loss of her friend, I find it amazing that she spent so much time on her own feelings, responses, actions, etc. during this time, and very little (and that little so chopped and flashback that your opinion of Bibi was not at all admiring) on her friend.    Actually, by the first 60 pages, I had concluded that Bibi was  rude and a spoiled brat, and Melanie was a neurotic cry baby.  After that, I flipped through just to see if the boyfriend was guilty, and what the verdict was at the trial.  I notice it's listed as something like $.21 used.  Don't waste your money 
 I got my hands on this 'pocket-'book by chance about 14 years ago and what a disappointment it was then! There is no Sanskrit, yoga is translated as !discipline!.. Did Ms. Miller have a clue about what she was doing other than make some money? Now that I have read translations by Sri Yogananda and Prabhupada, I have the ability to comment on it further. The Bhagavad Gita is not a simple set of words to be translated, this is a philosophy of life in sutra form-absolutely condensed so it could be passed down by guru to disciple by word of mouth. The guru transfers the knowledge not only by recitation but by showing actual practise.  So, Ms. Miller has no qualification to translate other than knowledge of a language which can be picked up by a 10 year old. Even a 10 year old would do a better job at translating 'yoga' 
 I bought this book expecting to share some fascinating stories and experiences, instead each chapter began a buildup and then suddenly you were left standing there alone wondering what happened where did the story go. Very aggravating, then oh yes, this is by the way, where we were, toodle oo on the next tale, or a portion of it anyway 
 I got this as a gift, so I don't know anything about it except what my son has said 
 This towel holder is functional but flimsy. The stainless steel is too thin at the base and the actual weighted part of the base is plastic. As long as no one's using the holder it looks OK but as soon as you try to yank a towel off the roll the base moves around and you get that "cheap feeling. 
 This is awful. About as punk as Kylie Minogue. The only band that can save epiatph records is Death by Stereo. And they arent even on this disc. Go to hell Gueruwitz and epitaph record 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 Our son is 7 years old and wants to learn how to play the drums.  I thought this would be a great book (I did look inside the book through Amazon's viewer) and it looked great.  The problem is the CD, it's horrible.  The whole point in having a CD along with the book is so the kid can hear what his lesson is suppose to sound like.  The stuff on the CD isn't even drums, it's a whole variety of other instruments!  In addition to this set we also got Carmen Appice's Realistic Rock for Kids, which also comes with a CD, and we love that one.  Carmine actually narrates the book and takes the kids lesson by lesson like he was sitting right there with them.  He is also playing the lessons ON THE DRUMS so the kids can hear what they are suppose to sound like.  I recommend checking that one out instead of wasting your money on this one 
 If people understood the principles of reinforcement and punishment, there should be no surprise that people can be taught new behaviors in a short amount of time.  The more important thing is how to change these innapropriate behaviors on a large scale 
 I suppose it only made sense, after reading the previous two books, for Baxter to have wound up here. I mean, after Exultant, what was really left? I was hoping he would have tied things together, and continued the story. Instead, we fast forward from "now" to 500,000 years from now (whereas Exultant was 25,000 years from today, and coalescent was -1,500 years from today). Like the other two books, we have two plot threads. The nearer takes place in the near term future, in a somewhat contrived description of a pre-global-warming-apocalypse earth, with Yet Another Damn Poole taking the lead role (a bit like his Reid Malenfant in the Manifold series, which I grew to detest).  The other thread is what most irritated me. While I appreciated his grand tour of the possibilities of human evolution, I was put off by his wide-eyed speculation and what-if's. Many of the things he describes are fundamentally plausible, in the way that drag racing possibilities can be speculated on paper. But they ring hollow. Sure, you can described silicon-based life, but is it plausible? And the humans-made-dolphins (again, from Manifold) show up again, being equally silly this time around.  But, that's not really the worst of the book. Towards the end, the book lapses into navel-gazing, much in the way Hideaki Anno's Neon Genesis Evangelion does in the later part of the series. Sadly, it's just as hard to wrap your head around. The philosophical meandering doesn't make much sense, and seems to have very little to do with the previous books, or indeed the rest of the Xeelee Sequence. Certainly it's a departure from Ring, which was frankly an impressive epic set in the same sequence. But, really, what choice did he have by setting the environment half a million years from now?  The "contemporary" thread (set in the 2050's) is... "interesting," but also seems to borrow from the Malenfant stick figure he has developed elsewhere (and indeed the Peter character from Coalescent re-appears in this book with a different name, but the same physical description, neuroses, and agenda), as well as the notions in John Brunner's The Sheep Look Up. Sure, it made sense in Brunner's take on things, but we've _read_ that already. There's no sense in an educated engineer getting all misty eyed about global warming in a book set half a million years in the future.  So, sadly, the last book (although a fourth book, with short stories from the rest of the Coalescent books, has just been published) finishes the series by wobbling between "why am I reading this" and "this is just entirely silly."  Exultant is worth a read, but could probably be thrown into the Xeelee Sequence and read alongside Ring. Coalescent and Transcendant, I could do without 
 Blues...is a collection of short poetry & prose selections, mainly dealing with issues that personally effect the author and her blackness. It's loaded with stereotypes about non-blacks, while being heavy with  hatred & condemnation about people who stereotype blacks. Hypocrisy.  While some opinions are based in reality, others are just plain wrong  subjective conclusions. Aside from the subject matter, the flow of the  poems and prose are hit & miss. Some do have a great rhythm & flow,  while others just come off as a ripoff of Rabelasian lists and Celineian  thought fragments. Instead of getting this non-black reader to understand  her situation & sympathize with it, I instead found myself saying  "Did you ever think you have so many problems with white people  because you have so much hatred and annimosity towards them?" There's  definately some "pot calling the kettle black" shenannigans going  on here 
 Ni se molesten en comprar esta basura, no sirve, nada que ver, El problema es el siguiente aunque ya sabemos que el quiere cantar pop en vez de salsa no es la primera vez que lo hace y a tenido mucho exito con los otros cds anteriores pero este desde que comienza la lirica de las canciones como que no riman, el ritmo tampoco ayuda, el disco anterior si que era un disco tenia salsa y pop como este. El anterior le da 20 patas a este,al parecer el cambio los arreglistas si me gusta como una o dos canciones es mucho ( boricua siempre sere y sobre tu piel) tanta espera para nada.......... 
 This is a poorly written finance text. It is not organized and unclear in some sections. I have a degree in Finance, and I would never recommend this book to anyone 
 If he would have done any research at all, he would have found that no one ever "ordered" the library at Alexandria to be sacked. It caught fire during a naval battle quite by accident. Its unfortunatly true because nothing or at least very little made it out.  No narative I have ever read or heard of has ever claims otherwise. Ceasar was not the type to either sack or torch a library 
 Wow! Four Tet sounds much like Tortoise, except not nearly as good. If anyone thinks Four Tet has some shred of decency, go pick up any Tortoise album and be amazed by the difference 
 This is the first review I have ever written.  I decided to write the review, because this is the first book I have ever purchased that I cannot finish.  If you took the facts from the book, you could only fill up a pamphlet at best.  If you want to read one big editorial about the author's political views, then this book is for you.  The author would like you to believe that everyone in the book is pure evil.  Maybe the book got better after page 125, but I will never know.  Terribl 
 I enjoy most of Card's work for their thoughtfulness and characters.  Neither come through here and I cannot recommend this book for Card's readers only for fans of action.  The book is a quick read and unsatisfying in the end.  After all, a story is supposed to have a problem and a solution.  Card seems to have gone for the literary anti-solution ("Wait and see" his characters say to each other) but with nothing else to attract readers of literature rather than stories.  The heroes go after one straw villain after another discovering again and again that they have not found the true villain.  It is strongly hinted that a certain character has encouraged all the mayhem either for his own benefit or possibly in order to shake up the status quo and get rid of the extremists of both sides, but although the characters will obviously figure out which is true it doesn't seem to occur to them that the end doesn't justify the means either the evil goal or the 'good' one.  The book seemed like an inflated pastry which collapsed when the heat leaked out and upon further examintion was full of noxioius ingredients.  
 I was raised in Virginia and never understood the details of the Battle of Yorktown. Now I see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together. Immediately after finishing this book I returned to Yorktown with an entirely different understanding. I could relive the battle as if I had been there during the war. It was fascinating! I never learned this from history books.  Male Age 60 
 I gagged my way through The Notebook but thought I would give Nicholas Sparks another try.  I read about 1/3 of the book and decided it was a waste of my time.  
 Once I read the description on the author, about how she's a screenwriter, it all makes sense.  I mean this in the sense that the text is not lyrical.  It's just there to serve the purpose of conveying the plot, nothing else.  There's no poetry to the writing.  Like many have said already, the characters lack depth, the plot is not much more than a soap opera, the recipes are added to the writing almost as an afterthought (they're just dropped in), and the ending is so forced and abrupt and ODD, that the book just left me feeling like I wasted my time reading it.  I did find the smattering of information about the Mexican revolution interesting.  Maybe I'm too much of a realist and enjoy nonfiction too much, but this story just was not for me 
 This review is more about the "SuperBit" transfer of the movie to DVD than the movie itself.  The movie itself is great and I highly recommend it.  However, the transfer on to this 2002 "SuperBit" version is very lacking in several areas.  The SUPERBIT idea is a good one that is poorly executed on this transfer.  The original intent was to maximize video and audio quality by limiting or even eliminating extra features (like trailers, documentaries, featurettes, and "Making-Of" snippets) to reserve space such that the movie can be presented in the highest quality.  They have failed to do that here.  The video and audio quality are not what they could be.  First, the movie is encoded onto a DVD-9 RSDL disc.  This means the DVD is capable of storing 9.5 GB of data.  However, not even 6 GB is used. As a result, the video and audio quality is not what it could be.  "Panic Room" is a 112 minute movie.  Any movie that is 2 hours long or less should be able to easily fit on a DVD-9 disc at maximum encoding rate, provided no extra features are placed on the disc. The maximum video encoding rate to fit a 2 hour (or less) movie onto a DVD-9 disc is 9.8 Mbps.  However, this SuperBit version averages only 6.5 Mbps.  This SuperBit version offers audio encoding in 3 types: Dolby 2.0 Surround 192kbps, Dolby Digital 5.1, and DTS 5.1.  At first glance this is great news, until you discover that the DTS encoding isn't as high quality as it could be.  The DD 2.0 Surround is presented at a bitrate of 192bkps as expected.  So is the DD 5.1 at the expected 384kbps rate.  DTS 5.1 can go as high as 1536 kbps, but on this disc is presented at only 768 kbps.  This is unsatisfactory given the fact that one-third of the available disc space of the DVD-9 isn't even used.  The DTS encoding rate should be at least 1024 kbps for a movie like this.  This would represent a 33% increase in filespace for the audio portion, but a much larger increase in audio quality to the human ear.  The filespace increase would be only about 256 MB, which is very reasonable when you have over 3 GB of space not even being used.   If they had encoded "Panic Room" on this SuperBit disc at an average video bitrate of 9.5 Mbps, and removed the trailers and features, they would have had enough space to present all three audio encodings above, especially the DTS 5.1 encoding at the 1024 kbps rate I stated.    Such an encoding process would have used 9.4 GB of the 9.5 GB of available space.  A much better way to fill up the DVD-9 disc and adhere to the spirit of the SuperBit ideal.  The result would have been a movie encoded to DVD-9 at a much higher video and audio quality than what was presented on this disc.  I notice that they will be offering a repackaged SuperBit version in October 2006.  Hopefully that version will fix the flaws I just mentioned and present the movie in the highest encoding rate both video-wise and audio-wise.  It might even offer the better DD-EX 6.1 and DTS-ES 6.1 audio encodings for that extra rear center channel that many A/V receivers can process now.  Another thing I am noticing is that many times, for popular movies, they are released them in 2-disc editions.  The first disc contains only the movie and the second disc is all the extra stuff.  If the movie contains both DD and DTS encodings on the first disc, with a very high video bitrate of 9.0 Mbps or greater, it is already in the SuperBit mold. 
 I usually love JAK books but this book was the dullest book I have ever read. It took me a month to read it when I usually read her books it a 3-5 hour session. I think the reason I did not like it was there was in my opinion too much detail about the dream levels and the heroines family/friends were not likeable. I also think the book missed her trademark sense of humor 
 In this instance the author peppers the book with snide asides about Christianity and Catholicism,politics,the Communists were "never a threat," and, of course, Ronald Reagan made bad deals for his Screen Actors Guild.  If they were so bad, why was he elected president of the SAG twice? Overall the book is well written, but there are enough errors I am aware of to make me wonder about the validity of the purported facts outside of my limited knowledge of Jimmy Stewart.  Politics is fine except when it is unsubstantiated conjecture 
  I was excited to see a new book from everyone's favorite biker, so I had to have it. The fun stopped there. This book is pointless, except to fill the pockets of Barger.    It's a poorly camoflauged retelling of his autobiography for the first half of the book. The last half is just dumb. It involves every half-baked idea presented in the biker movies from the 1960s and 1970s and ties them into this dumb book. I almost expected to have a bit a biker werewolves by the end.    Advice: save the cost of this book and apply it towards the purchase of a motorcycle of your own. But, avoid this one 
 THIS MAY BE A GOOD SOUNDTRACK, BUT WHAT THE HELL..I'VE SEEN THIS FILM A HUNDRED TIMES, AND I NEVER FROGOT THAT SONG WHEN HE WAS RIDING IN THE HELECOPTOR ON THE WAY TO VIETNAM.I COULDNT REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE SONG AND FORGOT WHO THE ARTIST WAS.SO I SEARCHED ON THE CRAPPY INTERNET.... FOR OVER AN HOUR MY POOR TUSH HURTS, AND I FOUND NOTHING, AND IT'S A CLASSIC SONG!!!!! SO I THOUGHT TO MYSELF MY BROTHER MIGHT KNOW, SO I SAID TO HIM, REMEMBER FORREST GUMP WHEN HE WAS IN THE HELECOPTOR AND THE SONG WENT "THERE MUST BE SOME WAY OUTTA HERE" AND IMMEDIATELY HE SAID JIMI HENDRIX, ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER.... SHAME SHAME WHOEVER PUT TOGETHER THIS SOUNDTRACK NEEDS TO BE SMACKED UPSIDE THE HEAD.. WHO WOULD FORGET JIMI, AND THAT BEAUTIFUL CLASSIC SONG. NOW I KNOW, NO WONDER I COULDNT FIND IT. IT AINT EVEN ON HERE! AFTER ALL THOSE CLIPS I LISTENED TO. WASTE OF TIME, PLUS WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT TO JIMI FANS. 
 I found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written, but also insidiously demeaning to women. Rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships, the author focused on the weakness and instability of women. In addition, his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage. I found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes. My fiancee and I have read Chapman's Five Love Languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise 
 My Gawd!...Morrel apparently has lost his touch, that must be why he hasn't written much in the last 15 years compared to the Ludlums or Follets. The story itself was FANTASTIC, incredible, fast at a break neck speed. I read it in 2 days and I have never read a book that fast. But two things turned me off and they are, in order, as follows: 1. The hero (Chase Malone) in every face to face confrontation withg the Bad Guy(s), gets his ass whipped, repeatedly. Yet on each oppurtunity he is able to dispatch the good guys (C.I.A.) with one smack each. 2. The ENDING STUNK! All the reviews I've read mention something about a 'surprize ending'. The only thing surprising about it , was that IT STUNK.    I guess I'll just go in the closet and dust off the old paperback copies of Brotherhood of the Rose, League of Night and Fog and Fraterity of the Stone...or are they in the basement?...Wait, no...I better check the garage.... 
 There are some good pointers that will be familiar to those who have studied strategy, but the authors' attempt to dress up existing knowledge using the "hardball" metaphor is just a gimmick.    The authors laud "hardball players" such as Dell, WalMart, and Toyota.  These are the companies that pursue competitive advantage "with a single-minded focus."  As if on cue, the "softball players" are trotted out -- those companies that "aren't intensely serious about winning."  Wouldn't it be nice if it were this simple?  The truth is that many businesses play hardball but lose anyway.  Think about it.  The "hardball" sports analogy implies that the goal is to defeat one's competitors and, by doing so, win the game.  As somebody who has built a successful business, experience tells me that this is not accurate.  Truly innovative businesses learn how to change the game, or play their own game, and thereby deliver superior value and results.  Defeating your competitor might be a by-product of success, but it is not the main objective.  After all, Toyota didn't have to defeat BMW to become the powerhouse of the auto industry.  This book is too simplistic to be useful to anybody who already has a rudimentary grasp of corporate strategy 
 This book is small in size (4inches by 6 inches), small in length (133 pages), and small in content. If you are looking for a book of glycemic values of foods, this is a poor choice. There are only 53 pages of food values and they are mostly generic, such as coca cola, apple, raisin bread, rather than specific cokes, apple varieties, or whose raisin bread. The list is woefully incomplete and what values are included, are hard to locate. Foods are listed by type (Beverages, fruit, soups, etc.) rather than alphabetically arranged. Most of the book is about what the GI value means and how to shop for lower GI foods. It's more of a rough pocket guide than a book 
 Most of these aren't even in the actual movie.  And to answer another person's question about that song that goes, "Boom...here comes the...boom" - I didn't check it on the DVD, but as I remember from the movie, it's POD's song "Boom" from their CD called "Satellite. 
 I've got a small bit of hardwood space in my apartment, and I figured this would suit my mopping needs.  It hasn't.  Even after sweeping the area multiple times prior to using the WetJet, I've found that it doesn't really pick any dirt up.  What I wind up with is a polished floor with a lot of small piles of dirt everywhere.  I'm even using the "special" hardwood floor solution- it isn't making a difference.  I don't recommend this product for anything other than polishing a floor (and there are probably better solutions for that as well) 
 The entire first half is devoted to physical beauty as it was viewed in the 50's 
 There are a lot of negative reviews already, but if mine will deter just one person from reading this book, then adding my 2 cents is worth it. Yes, there are passages of beautiful description and some intriguing characters, but these are lost amid the hundreds of pages of worthless material. One gets the impression that Tartt was trying to write a portrait of Southern childhood that would rival To Kill a Mockingbird, and that might explain the "show-offy" verbosity of her prose. I started to suspect that she collected her favorite bits from writing exercises, journals, and abandoned short stories and threw them together hoping we'd be so impressed by her language we wouldn't notice the appalling lack of plot.  No, you do not find out who killed Robin, and I'm fine with open endings when they have a purpose, but this strikes me as sheer laziness 
 I read the first 20 pages of this snorer and couldn't continue. NOTHING happens! Why would I consider reading on? What's the first rule of writing a compelling novel? GRAB THE READER ON THE FIRST PAGE! This book never did. I'm not sure how people can rave about the great writing - it just isn't there 
 Although not a blockbuster in terms of new, new-age material, I found this book enjoyable in spurts.  I do like the material on the mind-body connection.  Otherwise, the Yoga exercises described are pretty much cut and dried.  Would I buy this book if I knew its' contents? No.  It takes a lot for me to purchase a book that I cannot find at my local library or one that I 'must have'.  Unless you're a newcomer to the world of alternative health, this book is rehashed and remarketed material 
 I am watching the ST Voyager "Marathon" on Spike TV now, and it's the 'best' of this show.  I am glad I am not wasting my money on this, how incredibly ridiculous Paramount can get for charging devoted Trek fans $[...]+???  This isn't even the classic series....at least for that, I can somewhat buy into.  When Voyager first aired, I thought the premise was interesting and the story had promise.  After watching half a season, I got turned off.    The plot is overdone, and the characters are not compelling, (well except the Doctor and Seven of Nine and Kes--see below).  The cliche and anti-climax of always not finding their way home is annoying.  Their meeting "new alien races" got boring:  for instance, their first culture other than the Ocampa are the Klingon-like Kazon.  Then, at the don't forget, there's always the BORG (when the series is in trouble--bring in the BORG!!); and the new even more powerful alien race with a catchy new phrase: 'The weak shall perish!' WOW. It was fascinating to see how many times the crew of Voyager can get abducted, boarded, nearly destroyed.  Pathetic and weakest Trek crew; I understand that they were in an "uncharted and dangerous quadrant", but if this is a representation of the human race...laughable.  I thought humans had 'superior technology' as each new race they encounter in the Delta quadrant seems to imply.  It amazes me how often other more advanced races run shod this weak crew....  Stereotype:   Chakotay:  Is he Indian because of that cool tattoo on his right forehead? Geez, what if he took it off?  He looks like a Spanish guy to me....oh wait, HE is Spanish! Be'lana Torres:  Ugh.  Enough with the human/Klingon crap.   Janeway:  She's all right, but annoying. Tom Parris:  I wanted him dead in every scene and episode. He's a Riker wanna be and I cared about him as much as I like my eczema.  He gets to be an officer before loyal Ensign Kim does? No way.  Also, I didn't care/believe in one bit the romance between Be'lana and Tom.  I wanted both jettisoned out the airlock every episode. Ensign Kim:  one of the few Asian characters in Trek and he has to be "I know math, and engineering guy?" he never grew or changed in the whole show. Neelix:  Go away.  Though, I do like his race and beliefs, and how he found out the "truth" behind God and religion. Tuvoc:  Ugh.  Another annoyance. There's only ONE Vulcan.  At least, however, he tries to be different in some ways.  He's less annoying than the other characters.  However, how can the Maquee not know that he's a spy?  I doubt Vulcans make good spies...  The characters I like: The Doctor:  Every storyline with him is unique and he tries to interact with the crew and learns to be social.  It's amazing that a hologram can invent things like the mobile emitter, and nanites to cure Borg technology implants etc.  I find him the most unique character among this show and the most interesting, exciting and funny. Kes: Was interesting because of her telepathic powers and her ability not to annoy me as Troy did in TNG.  She was more helpful and less Cheerleader-ish. Jennifer Lien did a fantastic acting job on her, too bad her character had to die.  She made Neelix's character more likeable. Seven:  Ok, I guess, but, at least her character tries to adapt to the human crew; while the producers did nothing with Judzia Dax.  And, eye candy isn't bad either. Still, this Borg/human relationship does get tiring. The theme song was good.   Oh well, glad they ended the Trek franchise.  Nothing exciting, or original anymore.  I wonder if they will ever write about Enterprise C 
 I am a serious poker player and am well read in finance (CFA), so i assumed the book would be a natural fit for my interests.  However, I have to agree with the other reviewers who said "the book is confused" and the author's "editor did not reign him in properly".  It feels like the author is just rambling on without a specific point or idea.  It covers too many topics (off the top of my head: hand values, poker history, put-call parity, utility curves, psychology, horse races, society and wealth, then he adds some personal stories).  All those topics may have been feasible if they were weaved together better.  Unfortunately, he covers some topics superficially and some in painstaking detail.  Some areas are written for an audience unfamiliar with poker/finance, then other areas dive into advanced nuances.  The book is just not edited well enough to be a satisfying read 
 I am in my last year of school and preparing to embark on a career in banking. Out of all the finance and economics (I'm a double major) textbooks I have used this is the absolute worst bar none. While the text has a very large amount of information that same information is simply thrown at you with no real presentation.  One other thing that bothers me (possible the most) is the fact that I get severe headaches when I read this text. I have never read a book before with text this small. To me this says something since I am a voracious reader and frequently am reading 3-4 novels while also studying for my classes 
 If you want to understand and pass a subject, you have to read the original book (here Introduction to Statistical Quality Control by Montgomery) and try to understand the examples and the concepts in the book. In addition you have to do several exercies in this book to reinforce this understanding.   Studying some outlines, highlights and notes prepared by other people won't help you much.  
 I give this book two stars from an econometrician's point of view.  This book focuses on linear models related to ANOVA and hence may have a good audience in disciplines such as statistics, biostatistics, etc, but it has ABSOLUTELY nothing useful for people interested in econometrics or financial statistics.  For example, the book doesn't even mention heteroskedasticity at all, and there's absolutely no time series coverage.  In econometrics we also do weighted regressions a lot, and this book doesn't have anything.  I wish the book title had been more descriptive.  Linear models are many stripes and used in many different disciplines.  By using such a catch-call title, the book is misleading.  So, if you want to do linear models in economics or finance, do NOT buy this book 
 My first Finder book was a library audio book read by Scott Brick. I thought the corporate world of electronic sales made a nice backdrop for a thriller and initially I found the story fresh and entertaining.  I later found the story to be too unrealistic with too many unlikable characters.   Finder does an excellent job illustrating the villain Kurt Semko (I kept seeing country star Trace Adkins with a haircut) and moving the story along at a nice clip, but the protagonist kept coming across like a wise-cracking schmuck which supressed the entertainment value for this reader 
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 This product was dificult to get a heart rate reading on unless you are walking, would not give a heart rate even at low running speeds. I used this product 4 times and both heart monitor buttons fell off 
 24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.   My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.   Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into. 
 We did not have all the mounting screws-- hardware in the delivered box.I had to call the manufacture who responded right away and mailed us missing parts but they were not correct and complete.Very frustrating!!!!! 
 This book is a boring and useless effort in self-promotion and basic prostitution.  Wish I could get a refund.  
 You'll get no congratulations here on your book: This is just another paranoid attempt to slam the U.S. government, for the deaths of some dopey rockers on dope. Wake up" there should be no big mystery as to why these people died. They all lived lives of excess filled with drugs and alcohol, a bunch of fallen stars who burned out way before their time, except for lennon and topac who were shot to death, the others died the way they lived   FAST"    You see there's no big mystery to their deaths after all, just a few star struck americans who refuse to see their rock and roll idols, for what they really were 
 This was a very disappointing book.  The idea behind it was interesting and I enjoy reading about that period in history, but the character interactions were all poorly done.  The brother/priest who comes to hear Huitzitzitl's confession is wraught with historical innacuracies.  There is no way he would have acted the way Limon has him act.  He also seems to me to be a very incompetent priest.  I kept reading this book, hoping it would get better, but it never did and in the end I was left with a feeling of discontent and that I had wasted my time.  Save yourself the trouble.  For a good novel of this era try Captain from Castile by Samuel Shellabarger.  You can probably find it on alibris or some used book website 
 Judy Wardell wrote one of the very best, and first, non-diet books for achieving desired weight loss - "Thin Within". Then she got married. I can only blame her husband for converting an imaginative, insightful writer into a Bible-beating fundamentalist who quotes scripture in every paragraph 
 If you want to read the purple prose of a man who is deeply ashamed of being latino and gay--in fact, so ashamed of the latter that he paints a picture of gays and lesbians as a talentless lot of artificial people doomed by moral pestilence-- then this is the book for you. If you're white and heterosexual and you're looking for a brown-skinned person to make you feel like you're culturally superior, why this book will be downright therapeutic 
 This is the sixth book in the Left Behind series. It is also the first one in the series I did not finish in one sitting. It did not flow as well as the others, so as to lend itself to a complete reading in one evening. The book also spends a lot of time re-telling what we read in previous books. I felt this time like I read half a novel.  The book starts in the thirty-eighth month into the tribulation. But most of the characters seem a little too self serving in this book. Allowing their own desires to guide their actions. Whether that desire be derived from rage, revenge, self pity, or even guilt. Rayford spends most of his time focusing on Hattie or his desire to kill the Anti-Christ. Though I do like the description of the handgun that Rayford procures. And when the time comes for the assassination, there are a few characters to chose from.   The book ends in an old time cliff hanger where you are left guessing who it is that assassinated the Anti-Christ. Stay tuned for the next volume. I have read this far, so I will finish the series. Though most people my find this book suspensful, I did not 
 Regarding the intent of the American Idol competition, Simon Cowell has put it nicely and correctly on numerous occasions.  He constantly reminds, "This is a singing competition.  Not a dancing competition.  Not a beauty pageant.  Not an acting contest!"  Pretty correct if you ask me.  Along comes DREAM GIRLS and it seems high time that the Academy Awards heeded Cowell's astute advice in the reverse.  Someone at the Oscars needs to wake up and realize that the Academy Awards is not a singing competition.  Instead it's all about the acting and, arguably, DREAM GIRLS offers the definitive case in point.  To put it bluntly, Jennifer Hudson's acting performance was, for lack of a better description, hilarious.  The girl can't act and yet she toted away one of the preeminent Oscars of the year.  But don't take my word for it.  Virtually every serious movie critic, when considering DREAM GIRLS, noted what I have already stated.  They all agreed that Hudson's performance was amateurish at best and that she would, nonetheless, win because of her singing.  Think about it.  The movie was nominated for more awards than any other film and came away virtually empty-handed.  Now why is that?  Quite simply it's because the movie fell flat and considerably short of the movies that ultimately won.  Most honest critics, as well, were quick to note that, had things gone the way they should have, Eddie Murphy would have won and not Hudson.  Some have even been so bold as to note that Murphy's singing is nearly as good as Hudson's.  I heartily agree.  But, then, the Academy Awards continue their downhill slide toward being totally hilarious in their own right.  Anymore, movies seem to win more on the basis of PR and marketing campaigns than on actual merit.  And, as DREAM GIRLS and Hudson illustrate, sometimes it seems the Academy likes to promote a controversy as much as an actual success.  Watch this one if you want a good laugh.  Other than that don't waste the time or the money.  THE HORSEMAN 
 Terrible.  With so many good, REAL stories out there, how could there ever be a market for a 'fable'?  I should have read the fine print.  This is not a true story, but instead, a made-up mess.  Yuck 
 not what i was expecting at all - i should have returned it - not the seller's fault of course - just not what i thought it was  
 If you are an academic involved with the field of social movements, you need to read this book, simply because so much of the current debate in the field is about it. If you are not such a person, don't bother. Dynamics of Contention is immensely disappointing. Within the field of social movement studies, the authors are supposed to be the equivalent of Olympic-level divers--but what they deliver is a spectacular bellyflop. I give the book two stars because the core ideas lying behind it are good. The authors want to break down the artificial academic barriers separating various fields that all deal with "contentious politics"--social movements, revolutions, ethnic conflict, etc. They also want to move beyond their own structurally oriented work, so central to the academic field of social movements, to try to incorporate the ideas of their cultural constructionist critics, plus introduce more of a focus on social relations. Instead of trying to create an invariant model, they want to search for patterns that recurr in widely different types of social conflicts, with different outcomes. Finally, their methodology of comparing unlike cases to find the common patterns is intriguing. Unfortunately, they never really develop a solid intellectual framework for all this. They identify some common patterns, but never explain the dynamics underlying them or why they are so common. They are rather inept in their attempts to bring culture into the picture, engaging in very thin description. In their attempt to create a more relational approach, they completely abandonn all the valuable structurally oriented work they've done. Finally, despite their attempt to focus on relationships and dynamic social actors, human agency--as in so much academic work on social movements--falls out of the picture. Although the authors obviously put a lot of work into this book, it just does not come together 
 Once again I have to disagree with every other reviewer.   Greek Homosexuality is a strange book. It is also infuriating. I was never able to read an entire chapter of it. I threw it several times in the garbage can and then went out again to retrieve it because I thought I should know more about Greek gays. But the fact is that the more I read the less I understood what Greek homosexuality was. My own take is that the writing of Greek Homosexuality is an extreme case of a rampant scholarly disease called "not seeing the forest because of the trees".   If you want to buy this book because you are anxious to know whether homosexuality was widespread in ancient Greece and whether it was really accepted as a normal form of sexual behavior, let me tell you that the author has no definite answer to these two crucial questions. These are the kind of general questions he eludes or is honest enough to leave unanswered because the evidence is unconclusive. I spoke of honesty, but I sometimes put down the fuziness of all this to a wrong understanding of what it means to be objective. To be objective doesn't mean to just align dozens and dozens of pottery fragments and ancient author quotes and other scholarly references and then leave the reader to decide what this all means.   As I have just said, Greek Homosexuality is replete with hundreds of details about homosexuality in art, in law, in philosophy, in language. But the trouble is that it is almost  completely devoid of enlightening syntheses. Therefore every time I read a few pages in this book, I ended up knowing less about homosexuals in ancient Greece than when I took it up. This sounds incredible, yet it is true. I have tried to read the whole book several times, but simply wasn't able to. I keep getting lost in thickets of disconnected details while the myriad qualifications with which they are hedged about and the dry and technical language get the better of all my intellectual machettes.   Therefore my conclusion is: Greek Homosexuality is un-rea-da-ble! But I will gladly admit that the numerous black and white photographs of male nudes depicted in Greek art are gorgeous and give the reader a fleeting sense of understanding the whole mess of details in the rest of the book.   Touto biblion ouk esti kalon...   
 I bought this just to try something new.  I love peach and mango flavors, and this sounded very good.  I do think it's a good drink, but whether or not I am able to think better because of it is up for debate.  I doubt I'll buy these again if only because they are quite pricey.  12 small cans (the liquid volume is only a smidgeon over one cup) for over twenty dollars?  It's close enough to $2 a can to make it not cost effective to get vitamins and minerals this way.  The taste is good, but I have had lots of other healthy drinks that taste just as good for less than a third of the cost.  But now I know, this drink is not for me.  If you like good-tasting nutritious drinks that cost a LOT of money, this one's for you!  
 I read this novel the instant it came out.  Everyone was starving for more Star Wars.  Most of us mistakenly thought the sequel to the movie was going to be based on this book, but happily, it wasn't.  Its been many years since I read this book but I distinctly remember feeling it was all wrong.  The stakes in this story are very small.  HOWEVER, in spite of not liking the book, I still have it on my bookshelf twenty years later, because the cover art is AWESOME!  It was the coolest star wars illustration around at the time, and still is a classic.  there have been several covers for this novel, but the one I had featured a silhouette of Darth against a foggy forest, with Luke and Leia cowering in the foreground by a glowing red crystal.  Save yourself the money, and just do a google search and look at the cover.  Its very cool 
 Even an incredible performance by newcomer Taylor Dooley can't hold up this weakly directed movie. The script is cheesy, the moral is too obvious, and is obviously aimed at young children. Strangly, it's become a succes in the childrens world. You start wondering who it's aimed at when you find out that the planet is called "Planet Drool. 
 My initital impressions of 'American Gods' were nearly uniformly positive.  Although I had not read any reviews previous, I was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel.  But like a doomed traveler in Fred Pohl's 'Gateway', the book never achieved "turn-a-round".  The central storyline is further and further pushed off, and often seems to occur on the sidelines.  Gaiman's prose is engaging and easy to slip into, but I felt empty in the end, without significant payoff or a true sense of journey.  Those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by Tim Powers.  "Last Call" in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to "Gods 
 although the usual elements are there--defender of the faithful searching the heart of darkness (his own) at a crucial point in life (middle age); the good-as-gold woman who gets away; the woman who doesn't--sprinkled with stories cops tell each other. But it drags, as if written to a formula not fully developed. Wambaugh writes well, part Hemingway, part Joseph Conrad. But this adventure story for men misses in all but the gastronomical department 
 Up until this album I have like every Sugar Ray album.  Even though they went from bad asses to more contemporary rock, the self-titled and 14:59 were still good.  In fact I think they showed the most talent on 14:59 and the Self-Titled was a good feel good album.  Now to this album, "the new one".  You know your careers over when you've been a rock band forever and then include a rap/rock song on your album.  What the hell was going on?  Did Sugar Ray really even write that Bartender song?  Were they offered a barrel of cash to write crappy songs? I don't know, I just hope the next CD has some meaning to it.  Go back to any other style you want to or don't, just stop getting pussified...please!!!  Anyone who reads this, DON'T buy this CD 
 I haven't actually read the book, but the title says it all...the author doesn't understand economics!  Wealth is made by the ingenuity of the people who seek to produce better goods and services that would satisfy consumer demand.  Ingenuity is sadly lacking in China, now, or ever. Look at any Chinese invention, and see its real development only when the Europeans got hold of it, from razor blades to paper money.  Not convinced, look at patent production in China. It is eclipsed by most US states or European nations.  Sorry, no sale 
 The musical is charming, but this recording of the musical is awful.  In fact, it is the worst recording of anything I have ever heard.  It sounds like one microphone was used to record the CD live on stage, so that the singers sound louder or softer depending on where they were standing on stage.  Not only does this lead to awful sounding duets, but even soloists sound at times like they are 100 feet from the microphone.  Avoid this recording like the plague 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.   Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie.  This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch 
 Ok so I have always thought Courteney Cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it. It really is the most boring show Ive seen in a long time. If you thought she was bad in scream...and friends..dont watch this...there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it. Hopefully this show will be scraped 
 The most interesting thing about this book is that the author feels no pressure to legitimize his assertion that there is something special about 30 seconds. Because his background is in the field of television entertainment, (never to be confused with communications), he finds significance in the length of television commercials, which frequently run 30 seconds. That this is done for financial reasons, not attention-span reasons, has evaded him completely. HTGYPAI3SOL is just another in the endless chain of How To books penned by individuals struggling with delusions of expertise, whose only skill is self-promotion, that package the obvious and resell it to the gullible. Readers who find anything in this slim and overpriced tome even remotely surprising or counter-intuitive are advised to probe deeper into the self-help section of the bookstore for volumes on Shoe-Tying For Beginners, The ABCs Of Writing Your Name, and Gravity - It's Not Just A Good Idea, It's The Law.  
 I've barely had this unit 6 months and now all of a sudden it doesn't recognize any new disks for recording ! 
 What a disappointment!  Based on reviews, I couldn't wait to get this book.  Don't let the 48 pages fool you...half of the pages are pictures, and the half with writing on them are double-spaced with wide margins.  Took me all of 20 minutes to read (and only that long because of all the page turning).  Nothing wrong with being concise....except that the philosophy here is overly simplified.  Quindlen goes to great lengths to equate "Pefection" with "Conformity" and condemning it as inauthentic.  I do believe that women tend to set unrealistic expectations for themselves (i.e., wanting to be the perfect mother, perfect daughter, perfect wife, perfect businesswoman); therefore, it creates warm, fuzzy feelings to hear someone criticize perfection as being "boring".  Unfortunately, to claim that "[well-behaved women] don't make good lawyers....or businesswomen" just doesn't follow.  This is not deep reading.  20 minutes?  Don't waste your time.    
 I thought this book was very well researched, however, I was disappointed to see that 30 pages are notes and bibliography in a book that is 310 pages in length.  This book could also use another good edit for several 'snags' that I encountered.  Otherwise it is a good read 
 OK, I get it. I understand that Art Brut are tongue-in-cheek, and that it's the classic stance of hating rock&roll and loving it at the same time. OH the ambivalence of it all. My main quip is with vocals. Rarely do I enjoy snotty brit twang, and this album did not get a pass. Eddie Argos's vocals are so grating, I hardly got past the first two songs. The music itself is nothing original (much like the lyrics), but is catchy and fun, at times. Basically, the state of Rock & Roll is easy to bash, poke fun at, and criticize. So if you're going to do it, at least have some lyrics that are indeed funny, insightful or otherwise, and not just noting what is already known. As a music and R&R fan, I have to say that this album's worth is overrated and hyped by critics and fans, while Art Brut is laughing at us (rightfully so). If that's what salts your corn, dive in 
 I am a man who loves his classic rock, but I don't shun modern music.  However though, I just hate bands like these who add Absolutly nothing to to the music scene other than giving people urges to gouge their ears out.  This is just terrible.  Laffy Taffy is the worst song of the year.    We need some good music to come out.  I can't say that much, other than this stuff will be on it's way.  Read the other reviews as well, they all know what they are talking about, but I am just adding the back up, for the sake of power in numbers 
 I was very disappointed with this book. Considering the fact that there is so much FREE information on the internet about how to create scavenger and treasure hunts I assumed that buying a book would offer some additional and valuable infor ation that could not be found esewhere. I was wrong. Please do not waste your time or money on this book. It was very upsetting for me to see that this is the same info that could be part of a typed-up PTA hand-out at an elementary school. There are no ideas in this book that could not be found on various websites. actually, there ar eno ideas in this book that you could not figure out on your own. This book should NOT have been published 
 I usually give books the benefit of the doubt and stick with them even if I don't like the first few chapters.  I think I made it to page 30 on this one before I took it back to the library (so glad I didn't spend $ on this book!).    I just couldn't stand the name dropping and superficial characters.  Their lifestyle is just foreign to me and not something that appeals to me.  Maybe the book would have surprised me but I expect it followed a predictable formula.  Guess I'll never know but I really don't feel like I missed anything very special.  "Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman" or "The Good Wife Strikes Back" by Elizabeth Buchan are books of the same concept (I assume) and quite enjoyable.  Stick with them instead.   
 I think Audioslave's first cd is one of the cd's I've listened to the most over the past few years. Pretty much every song is great on that cd. This cd though, sounds like they are trying too hard to come up with their own sound. It comes off as too polished and radio friendly, while their first cd was a bare knuckle hard rock masterpiece. Half of this cd is just not good at all. I hope their new album coming out sounds more like the first. I like their newest single "Original Fire" a loooot more than "Be yourself", which frankly, sounded like they were playing a song for sesame street 
 I first want to say that Piper's passion for the supremacy of Christ is contagious. I have personally benefited from his ability to bring the church's focus to what matters most: The supremacy of Christ and the glory of God among the nations.   However, I would like to express my disappointment with this book. I bought the book because I was very interested to hear how Piper would respond to the "hard sayings" of our Lord. I was very dismayed by his exposition and application of one particular demand of Jesus (Matt. 5:38-48/ Demands #28-34, 43,44). I feel that his failure to uphold what is absolutely essential to discipleship cannot be overlooked. I want to challenge Piper, as well as his avid readers and fans, to rethink their understanding of Jesus' "demand" to the church to love enemy/neighbor as he loved them.   The reason I specify "the church" is very key indeed. You see... I understand what Piper was intending to say with his title "What Jesus Demands from the World." But I feel that this reflects his misunderstanding... or perhaps confusion with Jesus' demand to his FOLLOWERS to respond with the sacrificial "non-sense" love of God in every situation. It seems that he makes no distinction between the kingdoms of the world vs. the Kingdom of God. Are we not to call people out of the kingdoms of the world to which Satan manipulates and into the Kingdom of God which cannot be thwarted?   Piper mixes much and in the end he only makes comfortable the conscience of the "American Christian." He attempts to point out the radical commands of Christ... then he makes his claims "natural" by confusing the call of the Christian and the purpose of the worldly kingdoms. Of course Jesus would never "demand" that someone like Pilate lay down his arms and "turn the other cheek." That's because Pilate was playing his role in the kingdoms of the world (Rom. 13:1-7). Pilate was not a disciple in the garden who pulled out his sword to wack at someone's head. But if he was a disciple and he had done this... he would have been scolded along with Peter.   The same would apply to the awful emperor Nero. We never hear Peter or Paul rebuke Nero for not living like Christ. And they did not change their interpretations of Jesus' hard sayings because they saw that worldly governments could never abide by these commands. They were not confused to the point of mixing the role of the church and the role of the worldly kingdoms. Romans 12 describes the role of the church vs. the role of the worldly kingdoms in Rom. 13. Only those who know Christ are expected to walk as he did (1 Jn. 2:6).   Jesus said the "world" will know we are his disciples by his non-sense love (Jn. 13:34-35). Not by our commitment to calvinism or our love for democracy. Human wisdom leads us to believe there are "personal" enemies and there are "mortal" enemies. Jesus said there are just enemies. How can we confuse this? The point is very clear. When Jesus said love your enemies... he meant we are not to forcefully resist them... and certainly NOT to kill them. Jesus said we are not to "resist" an evil person (Matt.5:39). In Greek... the word for resistance is speaking of armed revolt or defense. We are not at a loss to understand how we apply this Kingdom principle. Jesus modeled it for us. When we make exceptions to this kind of love or hint at other "love acts"... we mock our Lord's example. I am afraid Piper said a lot of good to end up saying nothing at all.  I am not talking about "pacifism." I am not talking about living up in the hills somewhere or joining an Amish community in the secluded country side of Pennsylvania. I'm also not talking about the "Third Way" of a Mr. Walter Wink who presents Jesus' ways of love like those of Ghandi or the promiscuous civil rights leader Martin Luther King. I am talking about letting Christ live his life through us in every situation while being motivated by love of God and man! I wouldn't even call it "non-resistance." I would call it resisting with Christ's love that makes no sense to the world... yet... it is overcoming evil and confounding those who mean us harm. (For we know this love does no harm to its neighbor according to Rom. 13:10) Now that... is truly radical!   We must take more seriously Christ's person and work. This is absolutely essential to our faith. When we ignore kingdom principles (or change them) we cease to be in the world and establish ourselves as permanant citizens. At this point...we lose our distinct identity and we deny our true citizenship (Phil. 3:20). The church should have no fear of taking Jesus "more absolutely" than he intended (p.238). Quiet honestly, how do you get more absolute in love than in the example of Christ himself? And we are called to do the same.  Finally, I would like to comment on Piper's usage of "allegiance." We do not share an allegiance in "two directions" (p.325.) Jesus never said anything of the kind. Is Jesus condoning pledging allegiance to some other King or power? By no means! Submission and support do not mean the same. We understand our relationship to the world around us by our allegiance to Christ alone! I'm so tired of Christians using "give to Caesar what is Caesar's" as if it gives them a right of passage into anything and everything political. Especially in this "Christian nation."  Respectfully I ask, "Mr. Piper, do you think your definition of love is as radical as Christ's?" We should follow the love acts of Christ. Perhaps, then we will see the foolishness and absolute absurdity in suggesting that there are "other love acts."  Piper can tell people the right way to live is to love like Christ. That he did very well throughout most of his book. But when we say there are exceptions or even hint at that... we are no different than any other religion in this world that offers nice little adages and a set of morals to live by. As with Laodicea, soon the day of comfort will be over. "Christians" will then be given the opportunity to join with the kingdoms of the world forever in hell or suffer with Christ and enjoy victory forever in the Kingdom.   My readings of the book of Revelation confirm my vision as being biblically sound. Let the separating of the sheep from the goats begin. May all who belong to Christ come out of the great harlot who has seduced his bride with maddening wine (Rev. 18)! 
 I can't remember ever reading a  book that I enjoyed less. The Easy person is so forced that no one would or could believe him. I,ve read other books by Mosley, but this, Easy Rawlins should just go away. 
 I purchased this book before a recent visit to Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Taos. I lived in Albuquerque for 4 years about 6 years ago, but I hoped to find new insigts on places to eat, explore, etc. Basically the guidebook told me where not to go. It failed to mention some excellent restaurants in Albuquerque including The Dog House, Las Mananitas, Il Vicino, etc. In Santa Fe I attended a class at the Santa Fe School of Cooking which was a five star class - not mentioned in the guidebook. In Taos I visited a community of alternative homes constructed of tires and cement (earthships.com will explain more) - again not mentioned in the book. I did go to look at a ruin near Espanola that was recommended, but the reservation does not allow admittance 
 My four-year-old daughter was subjected to this travesty of a children's book in preschool.  Ever since, she has awakened nightly at 3 a.m., tears streaming down her face, worried about burglars coming through her window.  I'm not "squeamish" or a "namby-pamby" as suggested by other condescending reviewers of this book.  But I do value my sleep.  If you value yours, pass this one up.  There are many other good children's books out there 
 I found this book extremely disappointing. The author takes a narrow view of how an individual firm can improve its competitive position by 'playing the environmental card'. Although he cites von Weisäcker et al: Factor Four, he does not seem to be aware of the literature that takes a much more systemic view of how to reconcile ecological sustainability, economic efficiency and commercial success. The book is perhaps useful in that it vividly demonstrates the limitations of a perspective that is centered on the individual corporation and its immediate competitive advantage with a rather blinkered view both of the scope for innovation and the wider macroeconomic framework within which business operates 
 What really cracks me up about this junk is that you retards are losing.  Even Newt freaking Gingrich admits global warming is real.  Sanity is slowly but surely prevailing, praise Jesus 
 This short novel started off ok, but it was not long before my brain was awash in confusion. This is a highly abstract experimental novel that makes little if any sense. Without question the author has a wonderful vocabulary and on occasion really knows how to turn a phrase, but she doesn't seem to know how to put her natural talents to their best use. The reader never gets to know the characters (and quite frankly doesn't want to get to know them) because they are so flat--less than flat. Furthermore, the narrator does anything but narrate the story because he is always too busy calling attention to himself and the fact that he is narrating a story that no one gives a s**t about. There is no plot and the overall idea is as hopeless as they come--TRULY HOPELESS. I really wanted to like this work and I pushed on, almost against my will to finish, but all I was left with was a disappointment that bordered on downright despair. For such a slim book, this may have been one of the most cumbersome ordeals I have put myself through as of late. Simply put, there are millions of better things out there to read and I should probably note that this is the only book I have ever awarded a one star rating--this is because zero stars is not an option 
 Would you stand in line at an Applebee's for three hours in order to eat a hamburger when you could get a hamburger just as good---maybe better---at a dozen other nearby places where the wait was only fifteen minutes?  Of course not!  Why, then, would you spend countless hours plowing through this 760 page monstrosity when you could spend the same amount of time reading two James Patterson books, or a Patterson and a Connelly, or two Thomas Harris books...my apologies, Greg Iles, but for a simple, formulaic serial killer book, Blood Memory was just WAY too long.  The book has two co-plots; one involves a serial killer who murders older men, the second involves the mysterious childhood abuse suffered by the female lead.  The serial killer plot is actually the more interesting, but at least two-thirds of the novel dwells on the abuse instead and unfortunately the "secret" is painfully obvious to any seasoned reader from the first few pages of the book.  All in all this would have been a halfway decent novel if Iles---or his editor---had chopped out about 300 pages of unneccesary text.  Iles just LOVES to have two characters sit and talk for 3o, 40 or even 50 pages, but since most of his dialogue is what I call "soap opera" speak, meaning you know what the characters will say before the words are even out of their mouths, these chapters dragged on and on and on.  Iles also wastes pages by writing lengthy descriptions of people eating ice cream, taking showers, and doing other mundane things that should have been glossed over or chopped out entirely.  Come on, Greg; why describe a character savoring the taste of vanilla ice cream as if it's some strange, exotic treat that no one's ever heard of before?  Just as some people love to hear themselves talk, I think Iles loves to see himself write...and although some of his books have been quite good, Blood Memory misses the mark by a long shot 
 I'll be honest, I haven't finished it yet.  I've read 3 other books in the week since I started it since it is so boring.  I would not buy it again, recommend it or even start it if I saw it.  I'll probably finish it as a  point of honor, but stick to the author's other works 
 These guys, at least on this album, are trying too hard (in my opinion) to cater to a certain audience. No need to name your album after the style of music you are playing. Granted, I am not familiar with their previous album, but this sounds like a mediocre attempt to re-create the Inferno sound.  If you want the real deal, skip this nonsense and head straight for the World/Inferno Friendship Society. I promise, you'll like it more. Particularly the album "Just the Best Party" and the new one, "Red-Eyed Soul 
 We bought this tractor from Joe Brands.  It was a big disappointment!  It was very poor quality and did not function at all as was described on the Joe Brands site.  When I contacted Joe Brands and explained all the problems with this tractor they would not refund my money 100%.  They refused to pay the return shipping to send their dysfunctional item back to them.  They told me I had to pay the shipping and send it back to the manufacturer in Wisconsin instead of back to Joe Brands in Colorado.  I am in Las Vegas and it cost me a lot for shipping to Wisconsin instead of Colorado.  When I bought this item they sent it to me with free shipping.  After I shipped it back to them and they received it they disallowed my initial "free shipping" and deducted the original shipping cost from my refund.  I am out over $100 because of Joe Brands.  IF YOU BUY FROM JOE BRANDS YOU MAY BE SORRY! 
 Gerd Lï¿½demann begins his historical inquiry into the question of the resurrection of Jesus Christ by writing in chapter 1: "... if Jesus' resurrection did not take place and consequently Jesus was not revived.... Christian faith is as dead as Jesus and can be kept alive only by self-deception." In light of the stakes Lï¿½demann asserts that an investigation into the historicity of the resurrection is of the utmost importance.  However, after making the case for investigating the resurrection historically, Lï¿½demann goes astray. Chapter 2 is mostly a benign look at the different types of resurrection texts found in the New Testament. However, even in this early part of the book his agenda is clear: "Those reports within the gospel narratives that stress the bodily nature of the risen Christ are presumably of later origin (35)." The idea of a late doctrinal development regarding the bodily nature of Jesus' resurrection appearances is important in the strategy that Lï¿½demann desires to employ in chapter 3. He desires to discredit most of the resurrection material in the gospels as the product of late theological aggrandizement by the early church. However, even the most liberal dating of the gospels has them all completed within 65 or less years of the events. This is an incredibly short time span for reporting an event in antiquity, and severely hampers the potential exaggeration. Yet, even if Lï¿½demann were right in his critique of the gospel material (he's not), the case for an early and pervasive confession that Jesus was bodily resurrected can still be made. The reason for this is because Lï¿½demann, along with virtually all critical scholars, allows for and admits that the material recorded by the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 is of the utmost importance.  According to resurrection scholar Gary Habermas, virtually everyone who has studied the material in 1 Cor. 15:3-8 - including Lï¿½demann himself - dates it to within 3-7 years after the crucifixion of Jesus. It is conceded that the material in this section is creedal material transmitted to Paul, and represents the early Jerusalem church's confession about the resurrection of Jesus. In it, we find many interesting details: Jesus Christ was buried, was raised on the third day, appeared to Cephas (Peter), then to the Twelve, to more than 500 brothers - many of whom were alive at the time of Paul's writing, appeared to James, to all the apostles, and then lastly to Paul on the Damascus Road. Thus, we have a report from Paul, including the earliest material representing the church's belief, and it all points toward a heavily witnessed bodily resurrection of Jesus. Interestingly, Lï¿½demann points out that Paul intends to place, "his encounter with Christ in parallel with the appearances of Christ to the other witnesses (44)." However, where Lï¿½demann takes us after discounting much of the gospel material and focusing in on Peter and Paul's eyewitness "seeings" is to assert that they both fell victim to self-deception in the form of visions brought on by intense emotional pain they felt in reference to Jesus: Peter, because he denied Jesus on the night of his crucifixion, and Paul, by reaching a point of emotional breakdown regarding his legalistic Judaism and persecution of Christians.  Surely, however, Lï¿½demann's thesis doesn't deal with several important facts. First, modern psychology tells us that hallucinations (this can be seen even in the cases Lï¿½demann mentions in chapter 4) occur with people who have an expectant desire to see a deceased loved one. Neither the denier (Peter) nor the persecutor (Paul) had that. Also, James, the unbelieving brother, would not be in a psychological state of expectancy, yet he turned from a skeptic into a pillar of the Jerusalem church. Second, hallucinations are individual in nature and cannot be shared. But Paul tells us in 1 Cor. 15 that Jesus appeared to groups in different locations and over many days. Third, it is extremely difficult to believe that a mere audio-visual experience of Jesus would convince second-Temple Jews who believed in bodily resurrection (see N.T. Wright's decisive study of this issue in Resurrection of the Son of God) that they were really experiencing a risen, triumphant Christ. Rather, it was the persistent and very physical nature of the resurrection appearances that convinced a small band of Jews to preach and proclaim the resurrection of Jesus boldly in the city where earlier he had been killed. Fourth, it is extremely naive to conclude that even totally convinced hallucinatory saints could not be stopped by a simple trip to Jesus' tomb by his enemies. The Jewish authorities would have had every means and motive for producing Jesus' body. Fifth, it simply is the very best explanation of the evidence to believe that the willingness to suffer and die for the message of Christ was affected in the early church because of the rock solid conviction that they had seen and touched a bodily resurrected conqueror. Hallucinations simply could not have provided that type of unshakeable conviction.  Lï¿½demann's final analysis is that Christianity should be abandoned. Ultimately, though, it is the biased and highly presumptive conclusions of Lï¿½demann that should be rejected in favor of an explanation that does justice to the evidence of an early, transformative, powerful belief that Jesus Christ rose bodily from the grave. 
 I found this book extremely verbose and unorganized.  It would serve as a great reference book for a lab researcher or grad student.  But it's way too technical and dense for an introductory genetics class.  The authors do a poor job presenting the material in a comprehensible way to an undergraduate genetics student.  Not recommended 
 A dreadful movie depicting men as macho s#$! and women as tarts.  This was made in an era when people wore revolting tight stretch denims and hung out in pool halls and bars.  It was also made to capitalise on the popularity of Patrick Swayze who had just appeared in the over-rated 80's teen musical "Dirty Dancing".   A very pointless movie is "Roadhouse".  It does not deserve a bare bones DVD release let alone this new special edition.  Is there really a market out there for rubbish like this, or am I the only one with taste in movies 
 Penn and Teller had two great seasons but it looks like they have run out of ideas. We get an episode about hair. That's right, hair. They say that the amount of care that people give to their hair is excessive. Yawn. So what? Who cares if middle aged men spend millions on minoxodil? They devoted another show to attacking the idea that people should buy the best of anything. Yawn. Snore. This is no longer cutting edge controversy. It isn't even controversy. Sacred cows? Forget it! Here are some ideas to really bring the excitement back: Go after the Koran and show how it did not come from an angel. Tell the world that Martin Luther King, jr. plagiarized his doctoral thesis - and not just a few paragraphs here and there. Devote a show to the unequal distribution of IQ averages among genders and races. Make it clear that the allegedly homophobic charge that gay men are promiscuous is a fact. If P and T were to do a show on any of these, they would regain my respect 
 This book SHOULD be called "The Untold Story of the White Tigress."    If this group actually exists, this book is an interesting tale of their life and their beliefs.    As far as teachings...if you would like to know how to stretch or rejuvenate (take care of) your body like a tigress--you have 40 pages.  Sexual teachings are very few and are at the last 30 pages of the 260 page book.    I assume the publisher added the "Sexual Teachings of" part of the title in order to sell more books.  If the title was the author's description of this book, I would argue the rest of his works must be as blatantly misrepresented as this one. 
 It might be a nice little book if any of it were actually based in reality.  Yes, the author is right that if Hutton had challenged the dominant mode of thought to create a new science and been the first person to challenge the biblical time-scale and the story of the flood, that he should be mentioned in the same breath as Galileo, Newton, Darwin, and the other greats  ...BUT HE DIDN'T!  All of this had been already covered to varying degrees by many different scientists for only about oh, the last 100 years by the time Hutton showed up on the scene.  He is in no way a founder of geology, he is only an important and early contributor.  So regardless of whether the book is well written or not, the entire foundation for what it has to say is completely false, and thus completely worthless 
 While I'm sure the stories are great, I can't get past the poor type setting, and cheap paper which is practically newsprint. The words and illustrations bleed through from the next page making reading very difficult. And to make matters worse, the stories are set in a terrible, hard to read font and tight leading. This book is NOT kid-friendly at all 
 My son opened this and made a couple of stickers which he was thrilled with until the tape messed up and there are NO instructions on how to reload it!  I did not see the toy out of the box before it jammed up and when I tried to figure it out all I did was ruin more and more sticky tape.  I would NOT recommend this toy unless the company is more helpful with how the product should be put together.  Too bad...good concept 
 Joe Girard has an impressive record as a salesman, a fact to which the reader is treated at regular and frequent intervals throughout the book.  Self-aggrandizement notwithstanding, this book left me quite convinced that car salesmen have earned every bit of their sleazy reputations.    I suppose that if you sell products for a living, there are some useful (although hardly novel) techniques highlighted in this work.  That said, I'm not sure how Girard draws a distinction between himself and the myriad other "super-salesmen" authors on the market today...I certainly couldn't.  Beyond the general feel of the author's style and content, there are other cautionaries to relay.  For instance, there is virtually no use in reading this book if you sell expertise or advisory services of any kind.  Likewise, if you're a stickler for principle-based selling, this might not been the read for you.    To state the matter plainly, this book is replete with petty dishonesties that are pawned off on the reader as "techniques" of one variety or another.  Finally, the reader should note that Girard's text presupposes a fairly unsophisticated buyer, so if that doesn't match your clientele, then you might want to keep browsing the bookshelves.  In sum, if you're not selling products in a high-pressure, high-volume environment, there's nothing here particularly new or appealing from Mister Girard.  This reviewer strongly recommends that you find another seller.. 
 there are several quotes in this book referencing sex...such as: "as life's pleasures go, food is second only to sex", "anyone who eat three meals a day should understand why cookbooks outsell sex books three to one", "kissing don't last:  cookery do"  I feel for a recipe file these quotes are not appropriate. Unfortunately, i purchased this cookbook for my daughter to begin a collection of family recipes. There should be a notation about these quotes being in the book so people can choose if they wish to purchase the book with these quotes. 
 It was not all that it was cracked up to be.  I expected more, judging by the reviews I was reading.  The cd starts off strong, but then goes in a dismal, boring blah kind of place 
 This book has alot of "feel good" inserted in it. I was disappointed in it.  I bought it to give to my daughters and daughter-in-law, but changed my mind when I read it. It strayed from the Biblical view 
 While this is a cute story, I think it would do almost nothing to actually prepare a child for what it is like to visit or stay in the hospital. It might be okay for preparation to visit someone in the hospital, but definitely not if you're trying to explain to your child what THEIR hospital stay will be like. There are much better books out there for that purpose 
 i've had hk products since the 80's and generally like their products. but this is the second hk cd that broke just after a few months of light use (the first one after a couple of years). cd should last longer than that, i believe. i want to stick with hk to have the same brand name in the house, but unsure if i should throw good money after bad any more. 
 What rubbish.  Ridiculous situations, and poor writing doom this boring, stupid film.  Probably, the worst film that starred either Lee Marvin or Gene Hackman.  A real hack job that was meant to snare unsuspecting theater goers who liked the stars 
 Wannabe tough guy vocals, repetitive guitars, weak drums, and flaccid lyrics deppreciate a rather overrated band. Avoid.  
 First off, Kanye West is about as mediocre a rapper as it comes. He looks plain, sounds plain, and if it wasn't for the controversy that surrounds him, everyone would be like "Who Cares?" But while he sings about Jesus and lives like he is a prophet, there is no substance to him and his music. Lame beats, hypocritical lyrics, this is the core of what is wrong in secular music today. His interviews show him as arrogant, racist, and unlovable, but it is selling his music and that's what he cares about. So while his rapping voice is mediocre and his rhymes are abysmal and his life is lukewarm, he is sure to sell records galore and people will adore his hypocrisy (and their own hypocrisy). So let's be real for a second, because I am about to give you the best CD you will hear in years - it's a mixture of rap and rock, with (real!) beats, acoustic guitar, splashes of piano, and a voice that can sound like Chris Martin of Coldplay one second and then rap like LL Cool J the next...buy today Mat Kearney's "Nothing Left To Lose." The best CD of 2006 and without an ounce of hyprocrisy while being true to himself 
 Knights, Castles, Medieval Life: Boring. I love Eyewitness books and I like a lot of the Water Eyewitness books, but Eyewitness books like Knights, Castles and Medieval Life just don't appeal to me. Eyewitness  Medieval Life gets 1 star because in about 1 or 2 places in the book it is  kind of intresting but other then that this book is very plain and boring 
 Snoop comes with a very disappointing third effort and first on No Limit since leaving the Death Row Empire.  All in all this cd has quite a few below average tracks and only one great one and about 6-8 good ones (21 total songs are on the cd so only about 40% of the cd is quality).  Features too many songs with No Limit artists (something they are known for).  The production is too southern for Snoop's delivery and style and it effects the quality of the cd (Beats by the Pound make some tight beats but they don't fit Snoop well with too many of the songs on here).  #1 - 7.5 (f/ Master P) #2 - 7.5 (decent slowed down song - f/ Mia X & O"Dell) #3 - 4 (f/ Fiend & mystikal) #4 - 6.5 #5 - 4 #6 - 3 #7 - 5 #8 - 4 (f/ Mystikal) #9 - 9.5 (great g-funk beat - f/ Master P on the hook) #10 - 10 (a classic - definately the best song on the cd) #11 - 6.5 (f/ Soulja Slim (R.I.P.), Silkk the Shocker & Fiend) #12 - 5 (f/ Master P & Silkk the Shocker) #13 - 8 (f/ Silkk & C-Murder) #14 - 8 (f/ C-Murder - remake of NWA's "Gangsta Gangsta") #15 - 8.5 (gangsta track - f/ Steady Mobb'n) #16 - 7.5 (f/ C-Murder & Mystikal) #18 - 3 (f/ Mia X) #19 - 8 #20 - 8 (produced by Soppafly & Daz) #21 - 7 (F/ Master P - samples "Bout It Bout It" beat)  b.  Calvin Broadus - 10/20/72 - Long Beach, CA "G'z Up Hoe'z Down"  LONG BEACH!!!! ---- 213  P.S --- check all my review 
 What a lousy writer. If he didn't complain about everything and then get drunk and call himself a poet, we'd all call him an annoying, whiny drunk 
 Everything relavant to marketing can be learned in the left inside flap of the jacket, unless of course you are looking for a book on the science of building a fire.  The author has no experience, he only uses 2 real world examples that he knows very little about, and nothing in this book is relavant to marketing.  I want my money back.  
 If you want a list of all of the traditional ways liberals want to spend money, go ahead and read this book.  Callahan offers some well developed reasons for making these investments, but none are new or bold.  And the jabs at the conservatives, Bush 43, and Regan, we've heard them all before.  I didn't notice a mention of even one liberal program that didn't work, and that should be cut (I guess Callahan thinks we're batting 1000).  This book fails because it doesn't offer anything but the same arguments from the extremes that has done nothing for America (except to let the religious fundamentalists take over).  The book's title might tempt that part of the electorate hoping to dethrone the religious fundamentalists into picking up the book.  But Callahan's argument falls flat, leaving me with a picture of the sleek shark of fundamentalism with the little remora of liberalism hanging on for dear life.  From a technical perspective, the book had quite a few typographical errors, where the first letter of a word was wrong (town vs. down), as if it were dictated, and nobody proofread.  That took it down from a "2" to a "1" in my rating.  The book cover, with it's red on the left, and blue on the right, signifies what it is: the old, tired "us versus them" with no new ideas.  Another book with red on the TOP and blue on the bottom does have some bold ideas for real change in American politics.  It's not what you think.  It's written by a gay catholic philosopher (Andrew Sullivan).  Although I'm politically in the center, I have read both books from the right and left that claim to have an idea for getting US politics out of the ditch.  Sullivan's boldness holds promise, whereas Callahan's stale ideas fall flat 
 This CD will no doubt appeal to drunken frat boys and fellow travelers, but to me it's all a waste of what once was a genuinely interesting (though far too self-indulgent) singer. In the old days I could forgive the relentless self-pity about how awful it was to be his father's son, because the occasional great performance came through. But there's no such saving grace here - and the explicit lyrics are just pathetic; we've all heard more accomplished filth from grade schoolers. No wonder Amazon - and most other retailers - are discounting this CD so heavily 
 I purchased the 8 X 10 Photo Frame as a way to display photos at my wedding reception and planned to use it in my home thereafter.  I was able to get the product running and to load a 'test' set of pictures, but the product then 'froze' at the startup screen.  I checked the Pacific Digital support website, which provided steps (basically, a sequence of buttons to hold down) to 'unfreeze' and reinitialize the unit.  I tried this sequence several times, to no avail, and then called Pacific Digital customer service.  After repeated messages left on a voice mail system ("we're sorry we missed your call - we'll get back to you") at all times of the day and night, I was unable to contact anyone at the company and no calls were ever returned.  Long story short - our wedding came and went, the problem was never (and will apparently never be) resolved, and the Digital Photo Frame is now a $390 paperweight.  Absolutely useless.  My recommendation: DO NOT PURCHASE A PACIFIC DIGITAL PRODUCT.  This is clearly a fly-by-night outfit 
 I was prepared to warm to this book because of its promised inclusion of other amateur endeavors besides the cello.  But to these he gives barely a nod.  The writing blends self-centered prattle with compulsive journal entries.  Another disappointment--rather, jolt--was his two brief paragraphs about painting on pages 184-185.  Given his sympathy and respect for amateur musicians, I anticipated a reflection on painters who, like myself, struggle to express in our work a hard-won understanding of color, two-dimensional space, depth and authenticity.  Instead, he writes, "Well, there are so many amateur painters around, and their stuff is generally so awful, that they almost tempt me to cancel this book..."  Thus, I could not recommend this book to amateur cooks, painters, photographers, writers, tennis players, gardeners--or anyone other than amateur string players who don't know how they feel and need someone to tell them.  For the rest of us, our time is better spent doing what we love rather than reading about it 
 This book spells out what areas to organize and thats it.  It covers everything from files to designing custom closets--but with very little detail. I went through this in one night and felt very cheated.  I did get  the use of one good tip--how to get rid of my magazines.  But that's all!  Either this book is very elementry or I am extremely organized--and I know  the latter is not true.  If your really serious about orgainizing, keep  looking.  I wish I did 
 Very poor book, realy a waste of time. The review below said it all 
 Through his political correctness, Mr. Olson spoils an interesting subject! His message, repeated over and over again is: As all mankind has been interbreeding time over time, we are all the same, and therefore racism is unfounded!  He does not seem to realise, what a dangerous road he is leading his readers down with this politically correct message: What if future science proofs, that his thesis is wrong, that there ARE substantial genetic differences between people - after all, this is a new science? ( I personally think, this is not so, but what does my belief mean...)  People would use his very argument to justify discrimination, with the same vigor Mr. Olson is using.  Non-discrimination must and does have a different, an ethical basis!  
 I purchased this CD after reading several of the reviews and generally liking TMBG myself. I must say I am quite disappointed with this CD. The music is, in my opinion, not engaging in the least and strikes me as way too complex for small children. Nothing on this album "stuck with me" in the sense that I did not walk away humming any of the songs after hearing them. In fact, I found a few songs to be so unappealing I either felt like I couldn't wait for them to end or I just forwarded to the next track quickly. I do consider myself to have a fairly eclectic taste when it comes to music and was surprised by my aversion to this CD. My recommendation is to consider this only for older children, say age 6 or more and, if possible, try before you buy 
 For the most part, this is a delightful book. As I read this book, I felt as though I were curling up at the feet of a masterful boyfriend, listening to his words of wisdom. (I don't know why that uppity chit found his calls offensive.) Unfortunately, I am very, very afraid that I have to differ with Bill on one point: Jeb Bush. So what if social services have crumbled during his tenure as governor of Florida? Tens of thousands of brown children are being sacrificed in our glorious adventure in Iraq. Why worry about Florida? Jeb Bush is a loyal soldier devoted to the cause. He handily delivered the state to his brother, our leader. I would think that gives him carte blanche, n'est ce pas? (I am just checking to make sure that you are not French, Bill.)One star only. Get with the program 
 Rebel Rules lacks the credibility needed too be taken as a serious piece of business writing.  I purchased five copies of the book to give to my vice presidents to read.  Three found it to be a very good book.  Two of them, and I concur with these two, found the book to be sophomoric in its approach. I understand Chip's motivation to write and pursue the publicity wrapped up in such a book--it offers public realtions opportunities for him and his company. The book is well-written and at times funny, but lacks the depth of other biz book greats.  A reader might be better served to read "Pour Your Heart Out" by Howard Schultz, "Losing my Virginity" by Branson, or "Work in Progress" by Michael Eisner.  Unfortunately for Conley, he is just not in this league 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 I was disappointed in the book. It lacked some of what had been promised in the way of scientific documention, etc. Just another variation on the numerous spin-offs of the Atkins/South Beach approach 
 At first the case seemed like a good idea, but after the third use the zipper stopped working. Because the case does not stay open on its own, there is a tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart. After fixing it a couple of times, it is now permanently broken. Bad design. Perhaps Velcro would have been better here.  
 I ordered vol 2 and i was vol 1.  I sent the book back and hopefully she will send my payment back 
 After Vol.1 I was very disapointed in Vol.2. I expected different songs. 
 Without any previous education in massage therapy I was completely lost 
 I am shopping now to replace this.  Having had success with other Linksys products, I stuck with this brand when I needed a USB network adaptor.  The hinged door into which the network cable fits broke not long after purchase, rendering this product useless 
 I got this book when it was barely three months on the market. Since WPF (aka avalon) is such a new topic, there are barely any books to teach it. This one is relatively clear and consice. The problem is that the WPF version thay are referring to is obsolete. Many concepts and most examples do not work as is. The whole chapter about Storyboards and animations is completely irrelevant.  I believe that a new version is needed, and I am sorry that I bought a three months old book which is obsolete, but I can not blame the author, she did a good job.   Regards 
 Either this author is a VERY slow starter or his product is extremely boring. I liked the sound of the premise so much I bought four (4) of his novels. After two chapters, I put the first one down, never to return 
 The first CD-TV152 that I received produced no sound with TV.  It was returned. The replacement produces no sound within seconds of starting the CD player. I cannot keep carrying these to UPS for return, and will need to buy some other CD player 
 I am returning this worthless book.  Large amount of totally false, inaccurate information.  Most marks displayed are bizarre, seldom -- if ever -- seen, and many are totally incorrect.  Book not worth five cents!!!! 
 Could not find any application for my needs. May be usefull for professional photographers with press print application in mind, but for andvanced and amatuers photographers is useles 
 Mark Levin's book falls into some of the usual pitfalls that almost all biased political argumentation today falls into--evidence is often stretched and recontextualized to fit certain predisposed conclusions.  The book is clearly well researched, and Levin is no doubt quite knowledgeable about legal process and the language of the US Constitution, but his conclusions are often stretched to a degree that no longer fits the evidence.  I would hesitate comparing his method to a smokescreen, for I am not entirely sure if Levin is purposefully making exaggerated claims that he doesn't support but artfully disguises in the ethos of research, but at the core of many of his ideas are assumptions or basic contradictions that he just can't back up.  For example, Levin is trying to show with this book that there is a long-term conspiracy of liberalism that has been slowly forging opportunities for itself in the process of applying the Constitution to the cases before it so that there would be precedent to back what Levin calls unConstitutional decisions like in Roe vs. Wade.  Levin pushes a good case to look further (personally) into the basis of that and other decisions and if they do have Constitutional basis, but Levin instead goes into a history lesson of the decisions that predicated decisions like Roe vs. Wade with the assumption that every opportunity opened in previous decisions regarding things like the right to privacy was in fact the doing of a long-term liberal plan to open the doors of power for an activist court.  Certainly, legal cases are often made on the grounds of precedent, but instead of revealing the focus on precedent rather than the Constitution as a problem in the deliberations of the Supreme Court, Levin tries to turn the problem into an unsupportable conspiracy that comes across on the edge of paranoia rather than sound, unbiased reason.  And when Levin starts out the book stating that the justices should be treated as humans rather than gods, he wants to convey the idea that their actions may be questioned, but will not acknowledge himself that the history of precedents may also be the mistakes of the same human beings whom he does not want us to deify.  Levin also breaks his guise of the the reasonable viewer of history when he tries to establish the intents of the founding fathers, equating Jefferson's participation in prayer services at Congress as a direct negation of his over-used mention of the wall of separation.  Clearly, Levin cannot see no possible correlation between the two, and thus the questioning of the validity of prayer in schools must be a moot argument.  Just to make sure that his bias is clear, he throws in a little slippery scare tactic of suggesting a future where religious observance is also banned in the home.  Levin makes the same kind of rhetorical blunders when he suggests that Blackmun may have turned 'left' under the influence of his wife (while giving a little shot in the arm to Richard Nixon for having the foresight of wanting to base a Supreme Court nomination partly on the quality of a man's wife).  When discussing the famous argument over the inclusion of "under God" in the pledge of allegiance, Levin focuses more on how much the plaintiff's daughter actually wanted to say the phrase, which is of course moot when considering the actual legitimacy of requiring the phrase in a patriotic statement.  In the end, this book comes across as yet another argument of bias in what has clearly become a divisive popular culture--evidently, a book isn't commercially viable unless it has a line to hold, no matter which side. 
 My husband and I both are reading this book together.  We also started reading it with some friends (two other couples) in a small group form.  This book is great for any married couple, no matter how long you've been married, or if you are having marital problems are not.  At our group we read a chapter once a week, then each couple does the questions at the end of the chapter and at the end of the book on their own.  By reading this book together and discussing the questions together it has greatly enriched my marriage.  I've never felt closer to my husband then I do now.  I highly recommend this book. 
 I was a philosophy major in college and I hated this book.  But then again, the whole NAMBLA fic genre really doesn't do it for me.  I'm sure some literary aesthetes are going to pick this review apart, good for them.  I'm incredibly well-read and thought this one was just a tepid bore.  Save your time, read some Dostoevsky, some Dickens, some Milton, (...) 
 American lives.  Hannity receives his talking points every day from the RNC, and then repeats them like the Summoner from "Canterbury Tales," repeating his two or three Latin phrases.  Hannity's phrases: - Liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.  - Liberals don't want to defend America and fought Homeland Security every step of the way (when it was Bush who fought it)  - Howard Dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is Hillary, Al Gore, John Kerry, and every republican except for Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman.  - Osama bin laden was offered up to Clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)  So, as Al Franken says, Hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.  Don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  He is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs 
 This is not the greatest biography of any century. Its theme is stated in the introduction and then repeated on almost every page. You can extract some useful information and perspective - but it is not easy or fun.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wants more information on Merckx than can easily be found on the Internet. However, I would recommend skimming or speed reading to find what you want and not bothering to read from cover to cover 
 Bought this camera to have better print pictures than what I get with the digital. I've tried using it in every mode AUTO, close-up, etc. but the autofocus never works so most of the pictures come out blurry! My older simpler camera took better pictures 
 The book provides no exciting findings for strategic decision makers. The only idea this book has is to distinguish uncertainties into four levels and it uses this four-level frame in its following discussions. And even the four-level classification is cliche. You can skip contents after chapter 3 without regretting anything 
 I had so many bad burns with my first spindle that I had to ask for an exchange.  The new spindle had at least 5 bad burns too.  Also, the edge of the disc wasn't rounded but had a sharp lip on the underside.  Never again will I buy Memorex discs DVD, CD or otherwise 
 After reviewing all the choices in this category, I purchased this book because the description promised solutions to e-mail overload. As a busy entrepreneur running a 10-person team from a home office, e-mail is a very big part of my workday. I was looking for solid strategies to help me use this tool more efficiently and effectively. Instead, I got an eye-glazing management analysis, pitifully short on solutions. Directed at managers and employees of large corporations, the book is all but useless for anyone else. The so-called solutions were just short of insulting. A few standout examples: "Don't send unnecessary e-mails"; "Don't read every e-mail you get"; "Pick up the phone instead of sending an e-mail." Ya think? Maybe there really is no solution, but after slogging through 189 b-o-r-i-n-g pages, it would have been nice to come away with ONE solid suggestion that could be implemented. I can't say I got even that 
 The alternate title of this book should have been "HOW TO AFFECT AN AIR OF SOPHISTICATION AND URBANITY IN SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES OF PLODDING AND FRANKLY UNBELIEVABLE PLOTTING COUPLED WITH TWO DIMENSIONAL STEREOTYPES SO PREDICTABLE IN THEIR PRETENTIOUS MUSINGS".   An overly long title you might opine but surely not in light of the success of two such eloquent and verbose authors. I had hopes for these two having started with "Cabinet of Curiosities". Their subsequent offerings flagged sequentially but I retained hope for latent talent. Then this? This self-indulgent, conceited tome demonstrated a predisposition not unlike that so manifestly exhibited by the socially-upward-mobile.  I am so saddened to see that some of the most lauded exponents of modern popular fiction are the likes of Messrs. Preston and Child and perhaps the worst offender of all, Dan Brown 
 Not Poddy and Midge again, I thought musical hall jokes like this had been confined to history.  Still all the unsold copies will be welcome down in New Orleans shoring up some dyke, unless she tries to get elected 
 The author deals not only with the concept of  Christian Heaven, but some other religions as  well.  This would be a good book for someone who'se doing a study of beliefs of different  religious groups on the subject of  Heaven. Un- fortunately, that is not what I was looking for. The book is  well written, but as far as I could tell as I tried to drag through all the  psychology, it wasn't what I was expecting. Joseph Stowell's  "eternity" is still my favorite. It deals much  more on the  spiritual level on the subject of Heaven. I'm not willing to completely  give up on finishing this book, but it's not one you read in one sitting 
 I can't say I liked this CD.  Jessica Simpson was good when she started, but as her popularity has grown, her talents have declined.  She commited murder the day she recorded Senatra's song for "The Dukes of Hazard" movie 
 I agree with a lot of what the author states, particularly regarding bad English (being accepted) and a tendency toward violence being more prone in the South, but not a lot of the other claims.   As a born and bred Southernor, of Scots-Irish Heritage, I found it puzzling that Sowell claims there was a sense of "idleness" about those who are from the "Celtic Fringe".  While I would agree there was a general lack of organization, the Scots-Irish are known as a whole, throughout all cultures in the US (by those who are aware of who they are, ethnically) as being extremely hard working, spend-thrifty and industrious.   Although he has frequent quotes, some of them appear to be very general, or cherry-picked to fit neatly within his argument. For example, there are numerous indications, quotes from contemporaries at the time of the Civil War, that Northerners generally lacked the desire and work ethic to compete with their Southern counterparts in Wartime.  In fact, the South was DWARFED industrially, by the North, yet took a FULL FOUR YEARS to defeat, with a significantly smaller population.  Men from the South were much better disciplined and much less likely to desert.  It was difficult for the Union to motivate men to sign up, to fight, and to march long distances and fight. The South routinely defeated Union Armies of greater numbers, and many of the Southern victories were acheieved by officers of Scots-Irish (Celtic) heritage, including Nathan Bedford Forrest and Stonewall Jackson.   Furthermore, unlike black Americans, the Scots-Irish (and Irish) are KNOWN for their industrial, self-sufficiency, and rugged individualism.  Blacks are not known for that at all.  In fact, they are the complete, polar opposite, culturally.  To even suggest welfare as a way of life, to my grandparents in Alabama would have led to a severe tongue lashing and speech about individual pride and sufficiency.  These traits are not characteristic of Black Americans at all, with the high proportion of welfare, the dependency on Government and others (Whites).    Some of the greatest leaders in early American history, were of Celtic heritage, from Taylor, to Clay, to Calhoun, to Jackson, to Lee, to Wilson, to Reagan, Clinton and Kennedy, to Carnegie, McCormack, and the list goes on and on.  In fact, Irish and Scots-Irish Americans have had a greater influence on American industry than perhaps any other groups (I believe JP Morgan was of Welsh Ancestry).    There is a propensity toward violence in the South, particularly from those who descend from the Celts, and I am in agreement that there was and is a more general lack of social graces, within the general population.  But I am not sure that can be viewed as a clear nexus to current Black culture.    Virginia alone produced 8 presidents (and if you add Carter and Clinton that's ten), numerous military heroes, including the most decorated American soldier ever, Audie Murphy (from Texas and Scots-Irish). Ironically, even Jessica Lynch is Scots-Irish, it just so happens.   While I agree that those of Celtic Heritage are "rowdy" worldwide (in the UK, Australia and the American South), they are extremely hard working. I would put your average kid from Eastern Tennessee up ANY DAY from some long-haired, skateboarder from Vermont at a job site.  When I was in the service, most of my Nothern buddies had never cleaned their own bathroom, or worked in Fast Food, or done anything.  They were indeed, more educated generally (or better) and had more money.    I just don't see too much similarity between American Black culture and that of the descendents of the Celtic Fringe.      
 I understand what Virginia Woolf was trying to accomplish with this novel but the plot became too conflated. I was kept reading by the sheer forcefulness of her writing, the way she plays with words. I read it as more poetic than prose. Perhaps it was one long poem. Anyway, the plot, though unconventional, is lost in a sea of contemplation, and all the character(or was it two) seem to do is think about writing and life. I wanted more from the novel - I wanted more plot, more action, more coherency. Instead, she jumped from time period to time period and I didn't understand whether some of the other characters were both men and women or they weren't 
 i ordered this book like ages ago (26th of january) for aprox 86 dollars. now the price has gone up to about 130 dollars and i kind of have the feeling that amazon doesn't want to deliver it anymore although it is in stock. the order has been already delayed twice and they said the next delivery date is going to be the 25th of march...why do i get the feeling that this date is not going to be the deliverydate also?  if i'm ordering something and it is going to be delivered 3 months later, than something is really wrong with the service.. 
 Published in the early 1990s, this book puts forth the thesis that the end of the Cold War, and its victory by the US, marked a significant turning point in history.  Specifically, mankind can see the light at the end of the tunnel of history, that the liberal democracy that is America at the end of the Cold War is pretty close to a perfect society and once every society reaches this stage, mankind has reached the end of history.  No more wars, no more revolutions, no more upheavals, etc, etc.  Of course, events in the next decade up to and after the 9-11/2001 terrorist attacks proved this book all wrong.  Mankind is nowhere near the end of history; in fact we might be staring at a very long war between established governments and multinational terrorist groups.  And the dot.com bust, the Enron and related scandals, and now the economic and social wreckage due to a summer's worth of hurricanes shows that liberal democracies like the US are not even close to being optimal societies in terms of managing people - people or people - nature relationships.  I believe this book is even more foolish; that its thesis and its premise was flawed even in 1993, and that the author should have known better than to publish such bullcrap.    First, the human population continues to grow.  Yet the amount of arable land and drinkable water is not increasing.  This can only lead to conflicts.  It led to conflicts in the past, and will only lead to more conflicts in the future.  We are seeing it happen already; every year the SW states in the USA duke it out in courts over water access.  Every year the Jews and Palestinians in Israel bicker over water access.  And of course we have at least one war per decade over oil; whether it be in the Middle East or somewhere else.  As the world's population grows, we are only going to have more wars, and since wars make great history, a lot more history to go thru.  Second, the author's premise that America is a liberal democracy is totally false.  America is a corporate democracy.  Pull over 100 people on any American city street (D.C. excepted) and ask them who their congressmen is, or who their state representative is, or even who their mayor is, and after a slight pause, the most common answer would be "I DO NOT KNOW".  On the other hand, ask him/her how their 401K is doing, or how is their mutual fund performing, and you will get a certain answer.  This discrepancy of awareness and involvement between civic society and the corporate world can only mean one thing; America is a corporate democracy.  An even more potent sign; many of the prisons, schools, and health care facilities in the US are increasingly run in part or in whole by corporations.  Three of the most fundamental aspects of any society; criminal punishment, health care, and education, are run by corporations in the US.  Third, democracies don't always last.  A Roman Republic over 300 years old converted to dictatorship in under a century.  The area that is now Poland was comprised of democratic states throughout the Middle Ages.  These were successively conquered by their bigger neighbors (France, Germany, Russia) and subjected to dictatorships.  The Native American tribes throughout the N. American continent were all democracies in the purest sense of the word.  From 1776 - 1910, each and every single one of them was either destroyed, displaced, or absorbed by one nation that only allowed white males to rule; the USA.  Last, in any given time period, the democratic nations that exist are usually expanding their possessions, usually be conquering less democratic nations.  Semi-democratic, aristocratic England conquered the Middle East and India.  Democratic France conquered N. Africa.  And of course the US has defeated or taken over various countries such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Spain and the Philippines, all of which were less democratic than the US.  Democracy does not put an end to man's greed, it only channels it outwards towards its neighbors near and far.  All in all, a book of false conclusions based on false premises.  It is worthy of reading if only to see the mistakes in its logic and arguments 
 Sorry to disagree with the rest of the positive reviews but I was a bit disturbed that the cat kept dying over and over again in this book.  Maybe I should have expected such based on the title, but I found it unsettling nonetheless 
 My wife and I received this vacuum as a wedding gift. Before we even celebrated our 2 year anniversary, the vacuum had completely fallen apart. It won't stand up on its own, 2 screws have fallen out of the base, the house smells like burnt rubber every time we use it, I have to use the attachments to suck up anything bigger than a cat hair, and the plastic guard on the front is completely detached. Furthermore, everytime we vaccum, the HEPA filter trap opens, and I have to put it back together before I can resume. After reading other reviews, I'm glad I'm not the only one whose had these problems. I didn't pay for the thing, but if you're planning on it, my suggestion is DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM. You'll be shopping for another one within 2 years just like me. 
 I have to admit that I didn't finish this book. That is something I rarely do and a sign of how much I disliked it. For a while I was really torn over whether it was worth reading. Calasso is a beautiful writer (and due credit should doubtless be given to Tim Parks for translating it well), which is why the book gets two stars. In the end, however, I just decided the whole thing was too pretentious. Calasso isn't really retelling the Greek myths in this book. He's giving them in bits and pieces, in fragments, relating contradictory versions in some cases--and he manages to do it in a way that feels poetic, which is really quite remarkable. Interwoven with that, he interprets them for us--and that is what drove me nuts. He provides plenty of citations for where he's getting the myths from, but absolutely no scholarly citations on Greek culture, religion or mythology. He is, quite simply, pulling his interpretation of the myths out of thin air as far as I can tell, presuming to tell us what the ancient Greeks thought with no reference to any historical research. Now, I have no objection to someone from outside the field of ancient Greek history and religion doing an interpretation of the meaning of the Greek myths. Such outsider perspectives can be fresh and insightful. But to do so with no reference to the work scholars who have devoted their lives to this material strikes me as the height of arrogance. In the end, while the book is beautifully written, it's also a load of hogwash. I wish Calasso would put his formidable writing talents to better use--either by doing some research into ancient Greek culture and religion or writing something entirely origina 
 There is no doubt that Mercator was a great geographer. Among his achievements were: the projection bearing his name, the first modern Atlas, and even the naming of North America. He played an important role in the amazing successes and adventures of the Age of Discovery. He truly was an amazing man.  Having said this, I found Crane's book to be lacking. I thought that the book was well researched and well grounded, but the delivery was poor. When buying a popular history book, in addition to the facts I expect a gripping story, masterfully told. However, Crane's writing style is dry and while the book is filled with names, dates, facts and figures the story telling is simply not there. Crane often gets bogged down in minute details that are distracting, dry and are simply not important to the story he is trying to tell.  In short, this may be a good history book, but it is not a book that I would recommend for the typical reader of POPULAR history 
 Wow, where can I start? This book was truly dreadful in pretty much every imaginable manner. Not only was the plot completely absurd and filled with glaring inconsistencies, as already mentioned, but was totally transperant. In this type of book a little artistic license can be granted for the sake of a gripping storyline, but this book offers nothing in the way of suspense. The characters are ridiculous cardboard cutouts which do nothing to fix the book's predictability. I've never read any other of Cussler's novels (and now never will), so I'm not sure if his writing is always like this, but here he seems to have little command of the English language, his prose is drowning in mangled phrases, overblown cliches and pointless technical jargon.  A travesty from start to finish - don't waste your time on this book 
 I dont want this album to appear on every search I do on amazon. If I search for rzewski or sorabji or glenn gould for example, I have no idea what this album has to do with this. And definitively you cant listen to classic as you can listen to pop music, its is a sin to take all this pieces from the different composers take some sections out and then put it on a album. This is a insult for the composer and interpret of this works 
 I'm surprised no other reviewer noticed! Why did Penquin place Ronald Colman and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. prominently on the cover? In this reviewer's opinion, they must secretly realize that the wonderful 1937 classic film vastly outshines the printed word. I found the  story to be poorly written and hard to follow. Its' style is too formal, too flowery and too wordy!	If I had not seen (both) versions of the film, I could not have followed the "action". I constantly referred back to mental images of the movie to orientate myself. A review of "PZ" boils down to a basic truth: While most agree that the book is usually superior, occasionally the movie wins out. "PZ" is a prime example. ("Strangers on a Train" is another!). As for the so -called sequel, "Rupert of Hentzau"- don't even bother, unless you are an Anthony Hope fanatic. Reviewing the book makes one appreciate-once again- that wonderful film fadeout as Ronald Colman rides off over the hill. Since it happens to be available on amazon, click on the movie reviews. Therein will lie the essence of the wonderful adventure story of "The Prisoner of Zenda" 
 Contrary to one review, Novas and Cao did NOT research.  There are so many instances of incorrect information as well as shameless stereotyping.  I strongly feel that no one should waste their time or money on this bound  book of filth 
 The author tells us little about John of Gaunt, but a lot about his personal inclinations.  I quick read but with little substance 
 I bought these headphones because they had camo on them. I've had them for about 6 months now, and they've already fallen apart even though I rarely use them because of the shoddy construction and materials. The sound is merely OK compared to other full size headphones. Everyone that's seen me with these headphones thought they looked nice though, and they keep your ears warm in the winter (one of the reasons why I wear headphones outside in the winter instead of earbuds). But they're broken now. DO NOT BUY 
 This is probably one of the worst books I have ever read (listened to).  I was never able to find a plot, and even though no one ever had sex in the book, everyone was always thinking about it and wanting to.  Not very realistic.  And, sorry, Jonathan Morosz, but the narration couldn't have gotten any more monotone 
 A rather sophmoric collection of sub-standard vampire stories save the the fantastic tale of horror from the pen of unknown Joanne Dahme. This newcomer is sure to take a place next to the gothic Anne Rice in undead  literature 
 I did not find the information in this book to be accurate or helpful. 
 I'm really very surprised that anyone liked this book at all.  How could anyone who likes Salinger's writing stand reading Alexander's terrible prose?  It is really painful, and that's just the starting point.  As others on this page have mentioned, the author has little or no understanding of Salinger's work (the example of his misunderstanding the story "Teddy" is a particularly good example, but the book is strewn with them).  Worse, the author isn't just ignorant but actually hostile to Salinger.  It's hard to understand why someone would take the time to write a book about someone he clearly dislikes.  If you must read this book out of curiousity, get it at the library.  I felt really ripped off after buying this book, and wished I had not given a nickle to this creepy author.  And if you are NOT familiar with Salinger, by all means do not read this book.  Read Salinger.  Your own speculation about the guy based on his fiction will make more sense that this so-called biography 
 I bought an almost identical toy for my son when he was 4 months old and he loves it -- but I bought it at the local dollar store.  Lots of places for his little hands to grip onto while he was learning to grip and he still plays with it now that he is 10 months old.  I'm just not sure it would be worth it at this price - - it was well worth it for the dollar I paid 
 I just couldn't sit there anymore....the movie was painfully boring, the storyline totally rediculous....the stuff they put in to shock us was amusing...and not in a good way. This movie didn't need to be made. 
 Chingy is perhaps the most generic rapper in the world, he is a wack lyricist and all he ever talks about is gettin pu*sy.  Along with several other wack commercial rappers of recent years he tarnishes the name of hip hop, and because of retards like this non hip hop listeners dismiss the genre as cr*p and talentless (which is not true).  Jackpot went multi platinum, which speaks volumes about the number of idiots who will buy anything with a tight beat.  In fact the beats aren't all that bad, if this was an instrumental this would actually get a higher rating as I would not have to listen to his irritating voice.  If you heard Right Thurr in a club and thought it was tight (like I did), you are wrong, Chingy did not produce this album so he deserves no credit for the beats.  His lyrics are absolute garbage, what is sad is that a loser like this can get decent production, and some top lyricists have to work with nothing.  Compared to this album, his follow up Powerballin bombed and with any luck it will be the last we ever hear from this loser.  Find him working at a McDonalds near you soon!! 
 i was so disappointed in this book, it made me angry. It was the first time I ever wanted to rush out and buy a book and pay full price upon hearing reviews. People were gushing over this thing. While Messoud is a beautiful writer, I beg to differ. This was stinky chic-lit. I was insulted by the stereotypical characters and didn't really see any "twist" to them at all. I thought the use of the events of Sept 11 to be really blah. The characters don't seem to grow. they all just seem like whiny, pathetic, bougie snobs. I really expected more. Don't bother buying this book. Just drive by my house and pick it up out of the trash. 
 The bubbles are great, but the heater does not even keep really hot water warm. The water cooled down to cold in about 5 minutes 
 This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead.  In my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written.  If you haven't read them, put We the Living aside and read them now.  I could not finish We the Living.  I got sick of the stupid relationship.  I guess I got about 1/4th the way through.  Maybe my tastes are changing 
 This book was a disappointing waste of time and money. The author's introduction is a story of a man who was flunking out of law school.  He speaks of his early failures in comedy and then says he eventually began to study comedians he liked.  He writes of a very elementary analytical process he used to find what made each of his favorite comedians funny.  The analysis is one anyone could easily put together and there is no need to buy this book for this insight.  As the author continues, he gives advice on how to put together material.  He tells us to work on timing and delivery and recommends studding your favorite comedians to best learn this aspect.  All and all, there were fewer than 50 pages of the afore mentioned.  After that, there are interviews with several comedians that although are interesting, do not provide much help in developing yourself as a comic. In short, if you're looking for a few short interviews with a few comics, you'll like this book.  If you're looking for someone to help you learn to write your own stuff, the core of the few pages in this book is (1) Study your favorite comic (2) Tap into your own life experiences. (3) Use your "third eye" (whatever that means)..... 
 Scary looking but inpractical.  The wooden handle it too thick unless you already have extra large hands already (if your fists are that big you don't need claws).  The talon shaped blades are sharp but can't dig in, they can only scratch.  They even have a hard time cutting through multiple layers of cardboard.  Nice wall decor but nothing more 
 If this book would have been completely "intact," it would have been one of the greatest sources of Japanese erotic life in my personal library. However, besides numerous grammatical errors (please excuse any in my review!), the book skips three entire stories before arriving in a part of the book which has no connection to the previous tale. For example, the book skips from page 146 to 243 - 274. Then it goes down from page 274 to 179 and then back up through 243 all the way to page 402. So basically, this book is missing 33 entire pages that never rematerialize (please keep in mind no pages where physically ripped out, they just aren't there). I don't know if I got my hands on a "bad" copy or if this is how all of them are. PLEASE, BEFORE BUYING YOUR OWN COPY OF THIS BOOK, FIND OUT IF IT IS WHOLE FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 cons tips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the top  poorly designed, it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds, so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to it  putting it together was a pain, the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes.  again..poorly designed... doesnt even fit cds that well, there are gaps, and the cd casses are loose fitting  pros .......... i guess it can hold a lot of cds.... 
 In home room, we chose from a few books. Me and some of my freinds were extremely direct for this book. Our teacher told us what it was about, which got me hooked on this book. Once we read it, we were glad to give them back! "Eagle of the Ninth" was one hundred percent one of the worst books I have ever read. This book is right up there with the stinker "Skin" 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 I have never written a book review before for Amazon, but felt I needed to save other readers from this book.  It started out just fine, but started to get plain silly and ridiciulous by the half way mark. By the time I approached the end I forced myself to finish and I should not have. It was a waste of my time. Please believe the readers who have given this book a poor review before me 
 Back in the early 90's, Jane March made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit The Lover. Granted, the role didn't give her much to work with, but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers, including me. The movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring-board into a legitimate movie career. Unfortunately, choosing the unbelievably stupid Bruce Willis vehicle Color of Night as her follow-up probably killed any chance at a career that she had.   I've always found erotic thrillers to be quite a dubious genre. Most of the ones that I've seen, while sexually explicit, aren't really erotic. Nor are they thrilling in any way. This movie was following on the heals of the tremendous success of Basic Instinct and almost every studio was chomping at the bit to come out with something similar. As a result we ended up with some terrible films like Sliver, Jade, Body of Evidence and this film, Color of Night.   The plot goes something like this. Bruce Willis is a psychiatrist who has a patient dive out of his office window, going splat on the sidewalk below. He is so traumatized by the incident that he loses the ability to see the color red(!). He decides to take a break by visiting his psychiatrist friend played by Scott Bakula and hanging out with Scott's therapy group. He hopes that he might be able to make some sense as to what has happened. Scott's group is a motley crew of screwed up people, from a woman who is nymphomaniac, to a weird androgynous young boy. Bruce ends up meeting a beautiful young woman played by the delectable Jane March and he quickly falls in love with her. We get treated to explicit scenes of the two of them screwing in the pool, the bedroom, the bathtub and the shower. Meanwhile someone murders Scott Bakula and starts to wreck havoc with Bruce. He tries to figure out if it's someone in Scott's therapy group and on and on and so forth.   The movie is really quite laughable due to the fact of how serious Bruce Willis was apparently taking this movie. Virtually everyone else in the movie seems to have their tongue planted in their cheeks with their performances, but Bruce seemed to think that this might be an Oscar contender. Add to the fact that the plot is absolutely atrocious and contrived beyond comprehension, and add way too many red herrings, and the movie quickly becomes a chore to watch.   About the only thing this movie really had going for it was the explicit, but decidedly unerotic sex scenes. They really come across as more silly than anything else.   The only thing that I enjoyed was getting to see a slightly older Jane March in the buff and looking better than ever. What a smoking body!  But, like I mentioned before, she got a lot of the blame along with Bruce as to why the movie turned out so terrible and as a result, she has appeared in very few movies since. I still think that if she had been given the proper chance, she could have been a great actress, but people have all but forgotten about her by now.   It's really surprising that this movie didn't kill Bruce Willis' career. But I guess if he could survive Hudson Hawk & Bonfire of the Vanities, he could survive anything.   BTW, the version I watched was listed as being the "R-rated director's cut" with 17 additional "steamy" minutes added back into the film. Since I never saw the original cut I couldn't tell what might have been added back into this version. There is some fairly explicit sexual content and a shot of full frontal Bruce Willis nudity in the pool scene but nothing that's too strong.  Avoid this movie like it was herpes.   Color of Night is rated R and contains strong sexual content, nudity, graphic violence and strong language. 
 Most of her "ideas' can be found in any monthly magazine except for some of the suggestions that were a real hoot: "apply polish only to the center portion of your nail", "apply honey and yogurt over body and let soak in for five minutes", for puffy faces "carry a metal spoon...and keep it in a glass of ice water and hold it wherever your face is puffy", apply coffee grounds to cellulite, etc., etc. So, buy this only if you need it for the humor 
 My friend has this cord to connect his iPod to his stereo, and it works great, great sound, good ease of use etc. I wanted one so I went to Bestbuy today and got one by RCA that sounds just as good for $7.99 
 Ok,   Bottom line, i did'nt barely remember the first one...so this came  as sort of a new movie.  I knew the movie was in trouble when it started just too slow...but finally as things got moving i found the movie fairly good and kept me awake till the end.  Its not the best, but its certainly not as bad as how the other critics saw it.     
 This book has great content, but uses words and terms without defining making it very hard to follow. 
 I bought this book hoping to get started making my own sourdough bread. Instead, I found a mildly interesting collection of anecdotes, lore, and "recipes" concerning the history of sourdough in the American West. The instructions for making a starter were vague and brief. Most of the recipes called for commercial yeast anyway, making me wonder if the starter was even responsible for any rising that took place. I tried 5 of the recipes in the book and found them all to be bland and disappointing 
 Sorry, but Elizabeth's character in Pride and Prejudice was meant to be plain and her sister was the beautiful one. That was a recurring point in the story. Then why the heck did they cast Ashwarya Rai "most beautiful woman in the world" as the plain sister. Give me a break!   Wickham. Give me another break! In the original, he is a charming poor guy who sweeps vulnerable and strong women alike off their feet into doomdom.  In this version, I could not see, for the life of me, why anybody would want to spend a minute alone with this fellow let alone the rest of their life. His charm, if anything, was unconvincing.  The storyline was cute, but the actors did not have enough screen presence to carry this time old tale. 
 This book is pure fantasy.  I've talked to people from Sevillian fencing schools who say it just doesn't exist.  The book has many geographic inaccuracies.  The author has invented an imaginary world that he could be the sole expert on.  There's a few photos of techniques but it's just fancy recycled ninjitsu moves 
 For an 800 page novel, it was surprising how sparse the story was.  The premise was interesting, and based on the first hundred-odd pages, I thought I was in for a very good read.  Unfortunately, 'Passage' turned out to be less than thrilling.  There's no doubt Willis has an engaging style - how else to explain why I sat through page after page of endless plot repetition?  She's easy to read; her prose is clear and flows well, and it was clear to me that the constant traipsing back and forth through the maze-like halls of Mercy General by her characters was a sort of uber-metaphor in a book about NDE and metaphors.  And that's just it - it was clear to me after the first few dozen pages - why keep hitting the reader over the head with it?  Additionally, there was absolutely no character development.  Hell, there were no real characters to begin with - you can't make a five-course gourmet meal out of a cardboard box and a turnip.  The characters were merely mouthpieces to expound an interesting, but ultimately boring, theory.  You might even say the characters themselves were only metaphors.  The relationships between the characters are totally undeveloped, with the exception of the protagonist, Dr. Lander, and her friend Maisie, a little girl in ICU waiting on a new heart.  But even there, the relationship turns out to be - guess what?  That's right.  A metaphor.  My last gripe is not so much with Ms. Willis or this book itself as it is with the marketing of the book.  When I pick up a book in the science-fiction section of my local bookstore, I expect to read a science-fiction book, which 'Passage' is clearly not.  It's a metaphysical and philosophical exploration, sure, but absolutely not scifi.  Based on the strength of her writing ability (after all, I DID read an 800 page book about nothing), I'll try one of her other works, but I won't hold my breath expecting something fascinating 
 As an avid fan of Hamilton and other great sci-fi writers, I find it difficult to plow my way through Benford's mess. The story idea is good, but Benford's writing is positively awful. At times he can't even seem to make up his mind what tense he's writing in. Initial charater development is next to nonexistent, and following character dialogue is somewhat akin to finding one's way around a corn maze at midnight. He uses what seems to be an alsmost experimental approach to dialogue, and no two are formatted the same. Sentence structure is immature and disjointed. Its either incredibly simple, or so complicated it becomes difficult to follow. Some character situations are wildly implausible even for sci-fi, or underdeveloped to the point that they seem so. I would not recommend this book. I am no writer, but I can recognize great writing and this isn't it 
 I admit that this was a light read.  I found the premise very interesting, and I didn't want to put the book down.  While there were some small places in this book where the writing was very good, much of it wasn't.  As well, I found some grammatical errors that irritated me.  Finally, I didn't like the main character, and not because she was a prostitute, but because her personality was very weak, flakey, and passive aggressive.  I found her very one dimensional.  
 I gave this book a 100 page chance and still could not get hooked.  After reading all the reviews, I thought it would be an outstanding read, but for me, it was plain old B O R I N G.  Since it didn't pick up by page 100, I figure there are plenty of other books out there worth my time.  Sorry.  I vote two thumbs down on this one 
 What a disaster!  This movie is a complete waste of time from start to finish.  The animation is ugly, horrible, and unrealistic and the three stories are bland and boring.  What was Disney thinking?  Oh, I know!  "Let's see if we can eek a little more cash out of Cinderella.  Who cares if we destroy a beloved classic?"  Several main characters are completely different from the original movie and it makes no sense.  In the first story, the King has turned from a happy-go-lucky doting grandpa-wannabe into a stuffy, sour old curmudgeon.  Suddenly there's a rule about no commoners in the palace?  Uh...isn't there a line in the original about "every eligible maiden in the kingdom?"  The palace was FULL of commoners that night.  The story picks up as the Prince and Cinderella return from their honeymoon, so in the space of a few weeks, the King has completely changed.  I guess they weren't creative enough to come up with anything that would stay true to the characters.  The other two stories are equally nauseating and are not worth my time to review or your time to read.  Avoid this mess of a movie.  The really sad thing is that "ugly, horrible, unrealistic animation and bland and boring stories" pretty much describes any Disney sequel or direct-to-video slop on the market 
 I've given up on Dickey, this book wasn't good at all, and I gave an extra star. Nothing like his first books, and I know he can write better. I'm afraid to even read another after this one and Drive Me Crazy which wasn't much better to me.  
 How the hell can you make a movie with talking monkeys totally suck?  It should have been a slam dunk 
 I like the Wayne's brothers, wither you want to admit it or not, they give you a few good laughs in most of their films. So, I figured I give "Little Man" a try, and honestly, it wasn't that bad, I actually had a decent time watching this unlike "White Chicks." Most of the humor in this film revolves around slapstick violence, which is in itself mainly based around the fact that one of the instigators of the violence is tiny. This sounds horrible, I know it does, but it is actually not that bad (barring a few parts).   Through out this film I found few annoying performances. I have no idea what John Witherspoon was on during the filming of this, but I have the feeling it'd put half of viewers to sleep. I realize the character he's playing is supposed to be a bit crazy, but I quite honestly felt like throwing my shoe through the screen whenever he was on it. Kerry Washington also annoyed me at some points, but that was mostly due to her character's lines rather than how she delivered them. Shawn Wayans puts on a decent performance and is believable at times.   The actual plot (a stolen diamond) is pretty much forgotten throughout most of the film. Once Marlon pretends to be the baby, until the very end of the movie, the diamond is pretty much a useless part of the plot. But with this kind of comedy, you know you're not going to get much of a plot-heavy movie anyway, and that should be taken into consideration. Other than that it's a decent film. It's not perfect and it's not bad either. But if you don't like slapstick involving midgets then you can skip it. 
 I'm not sure how this magazine ever got the reputation for being more than the glossy fanzine it is. There's nothing wrong with celebrity mags, but this one has pretensions of so much more when essentially, it's about as deep as an E! True Hollywood Story about Kato Kaelin. I've tried many times, but alas, this one is sadly not worth the tree destroyed to print it 
 I did not receive the book I ordered.  The tracking process indicated that it had been sent to Atlanta to the Lost package dept.  There was no name to deliver to and no place to return.  I was disappointed not to receive a book I paid for 
 Well, I sure could have skipped this one.  I well remember the critics raving over this on television, but why is beyond me.  Mostly, I was just plain bored.  There simply was no depth at all, just bunches of short takes and wise cracks.  Bush was just downright dirty, making insults and slurs all over the place, something I do not consider an appropriate attitude in a man who would be President.  And it is interesting that in one of the reviews it was noted that Mary Matalen, the deputy manager of Bush's campaign and very acid-tongued (maybe she wrote some of the slurs Bush used), is now the wife of James Carville, top strategist for Clinton's campaign, and basically the star of the movie.  But all the scenes were focused on the funny quip, the bon mot, no long scenes of the nitty-gritty work, or any answers to any questions about Clinton either, for that matter.  
 Although I "listened" to this book on tape, I too was lulled into thinking this is like Jon Kraukauer's "Into Thin Air" -- hardly. It is interesting and at first I didn't realize it was a true story. Balf's book does give a bit of a behind-the-scenes glance at how a trek like this is set up & the importance of the personalities of the people undergoing the trek....but I agree with previous reviewers that this was no page-turner (or let's put it this way, I wasn't sitting in my garage, after coming home from my commute, to stay listening to the tape). If you are a kayaker, maybe this is for you - having trekked in Nepal, I found some of the countryside info of interest, but can't really recommend this book 
 I did not like the book because it skip around too much between characters. I could not understand the characters. It wasn't really abour roller skating.  I just wanted to read about roller skating 
 This book is awful. Hard to follow along with the reading. Poor examples, lacking and skipping many steps when there actually is an example. Answers to a few of the questions would have been nice, to know if the problems were done correctly. Must be a master of discrete mathmatics to have any understanding what is going on. I have seen many better books 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 After several minutes of his schtick, one realizes that being mean and nasty has its comedic limitations.  I, for one, wished for someone in the audience to insult and humiliate Rickles, because he deserved it like no one else.  I'm all for blowing the lid off political correctness (no one, surely could get away with this kind of routine today), but Rickles just isn't a likable or very funny guy here.  Even for Jewish attack comics, this guy has no class and delivers few laughs 
 Reading through John Irving's "The Cider House Rules," I found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. In obtaining a bachelor's degree in English, I had to read a lot of books. Among them were many books that I did not like, but never before had I read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety.   Every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along. People become pregnant, have abortions, and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. This goes way beyond mere foreshadowing. The book doesn't flow naturally, you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows, playing the puppet master. There are just so many coincidences, so many old friends just happening to run into eachother, so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly, all of the characters vaguely, distantly connected to eachother. I don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the Eames (rhymes with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. It's as though the author is God, and the characters completely lack free will.  And then there's the "protagonist," Homer Wells. I put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story, Homer Wells barely does anything in the story. He barely even speaks during the story. He is virtually a non-character, devoid of personality or will, around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve. The scenes that do not involve Homer Wells at all, and they make up the majority of the book, are without fail the most interesting scenes. I think that the real protagonist of the book is Dr. Larch, but even Melony seems more real than Homer does.   The story is very long and rambling. Subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on. Minor characters keep popping into the story, then disappearing, only to pop back into the story exactly when they're needed. Conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the situation with Debra Pettigrew).   After such a rambling, at times rather boring plot, the ending feels rather rushed. It is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything, tie up every loose end, in the last 25 pages (and tying up loose ends, in this case, means a lot of people conveniently dying). To spoil the plot just a little, Homer Wells, who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul, suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. I personally am pro-choice as well, but I found that Homer's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters 
 A good "companion" book to Sandman would tell you about Neil Gaiman's thousands of sources for his stories.  Who is Lyta Hall in the DC universe?  Who is Element Girl?  How about literary and historical sources?  Where does the phrase "omnia mutantur, nihil interit" come from, who used it, and what did it mean then?  Who was Aleister Crowley?  Instead, most of this book is a recap of the story -- Cliff's Notes for a comic -- with a few visits from Neil talking about the inspiration for this or that!  Very disappointing.  Not worth the money 
 I ordered two of the authors book's based on raving reviews from a friend, not actually this title but another. I ordered this one as well and must say what a total waste of money. The first section of the book is about the authors travels and how she claims she was visited by the Virgin Mary...umm yeah right, there isn't much practicle help in this book at all, only her boring tales of travel around the globe. The second part of the book is a list of goddesses and their qualities. don't bother with this book, it a time waster and $$$ waster I can't believe Hay house published this work of junk. After reading this authors other works I do feel she is very very over rated and has taken the angel working brigade thing a little too far and people have jumped on this band wagon if that wasn't the case this author would be unknown because her writing is terrible. The misleading promises on the back of the book should be taken off as well "Manifest anything you want instantly"...I didn't find anything in the book even about *helping* your life, it was all about her travels...Like I said a total joke..I won't be so easily led when buying books by spiritual workers again. 
 "Othello" is a play that will show you how unredeemable human beings can be.  It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs.  It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men.  The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle.  Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked.  This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend 
 Given high acclaims this film has collected over time, I was glad to pick up a VHS copy at my local library sale.  Began to watch it last night.  I was able to sit thru the part 1.  When the tape ended, I was actually glad. I felt a sense of acomplishment in finishing the part 1!  The movie is DREARY to the max.  People portrayed are irrational, lost, uncommunicative, and subject to random and cruel violence by soldiers and rulers.  In some way, this movie reminded me of the dreary winter (lasting 6 months!) I spent in Russia a couple of years ago...   To me, the movie reflects the psychological breakdown that happened after the decades long terror policy of Soviet state (1920-1956).  For survivors, nothing made any sense anymore, except perhaps fear and evil, as people in this dreary film reflects.  People have been already destroyed in their souls.  They are psychologically shattered beyond repair and only occasional readings of the Bible verses give them any sense of permanence in their chaotic daily experience.   Maybe that is the real meaning of this movie.  To really reflect what happened to people's psyche after Lenin and Stalin's UNLIMITED TERROR, they found a parallel in Mongol's devastation and oppression of medieval Russia.  In both cases, people were left shattered, helpless, irrational, withdrawn,  and autistic.   
 Dont buy this book!  Or buy it and tear it in two pieces because it is much to long.  Wow I mean talk about boreing.  Is it the best of times or is it the worst of times?  You cant make up you're mind on page one sentence one even!?!  If I am this guys editer I would have told him to just write about the best of times.  Thats plenty and people dont need another depressing book in this day and age anyhow.  Only ONE STAR for you but keep trying youll get there 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 Skip this book if you're into alien, u.f.o theories 
 Along with the nanny, the stepdad, the cable guy, the 14-year-old girl with a crush... we now have the PHOTO PROCESSING CLERK to fear! Yes, everyone is out to get us.. or at least that's what Hollywood would have us believe.  I am getting sick of films like this that constantly contort  normal healthy human interaction and community relations into perverse horrors that are far from reality. No wonder we live in a culture of such exagerrated suspicion, mistrust, fear (and the resulting isolation) when we have films like this constantly stoking these fears of people around us.      Yes, films like these have their place. However, I think Hollywood has taken it a bit too far and needs to pull itself back into reality.    
 I read this at the prompting of a friend.  However, I'm not that impressed -- it didn't hold up to the literary expectations I had.  It isn't horrible -- just a historical novel about the 1920's in Germany and Britain.  Hughes did a good job of providing sympathetic portrayals of characters some of whom are so flawed I would call them evil.  Honestly, that contributes to why I don't care for the book 
 The Mini Fondue Kit is a really great idea.  My girlfriend is a fondue lover, and I thought this would be perfect for her.  Unfortunately, the idea was better than the execution.  The first problem is that the assembly instructions for the metal stand did not match the actual stand (at least no with the one we got.)  The stand we got had three legs, not four as shown in the instructions, and it did not seem possible to bend the legs as described.  We think we got it right in the end, but the instructions should be clear.  (Note that the three-legged stand is probably better than the four-legged one because a three-legged stand is more stable, so maybe we got a new stand but an old set of instructions?)  A much bigger problem was that the dish was too small for some of the recipes.  My girlfriend tried to make one of the chocolate fondues and the ingredients ended up completely filling the dish to the point it was not possible to mix them without spilling.  Then, when she heated it in the microwave it bubbled over.  Had it not spilled then, it would have spilled when she dipped something in it.  It is too bad because it was a good idea.  I am going to get her a replacement.  I have been looking at:  Chantal Butter Warmers (ASIN B00004RKFE), Trudeau Basic 7-Piece Chocolate Fondue Set (ASIN B00029I3Q2), and the Chocolatiere Electric Chocolate Melting Pot (ASIN B00074HGJ2).  The butter warmers look close to what I think this item should be:  4 oz. makes them large enough for the recipes with the Mini Fondue Kit with enough room to spare for stirring and dipping.  The other two items are a bit fancier, but may be better choices.  I will write an update when I have gotten one 
 I wish amazon allowed giving "zero" stars to an album.  I bought my first John & Yoko album in 1969 ("Life with the Lions.") I got "ripped off," although I should have know better..  I was smart enough not to buy "Two Virgins" because of the bad reviews.  I bought "Life with the Lions" without reading any reviews, but I was young, naive, and a big Lennon fan.  Oh well!  The John & Yoko albums released before the breakup of the Beatles were all pretty much the same.  The chief instigator of these albums seems to be Yoko.  Her background in the "avant garde" and "conceptual art" is apparent in these albums.  The basic premise is: take a "concept" and run with it.  Keep running with it for as long as possible.  Let's hear John & Yoko call each other by their first names for a half-hour.  Let's produce feedback and screaming longer than one can normally tolerate.  After all, the big joke is that John Lennon's name is on this album... so even if the "concepts" are questionable and/or idiotic- lots of people will BUY this piece of vinyl because a Beatle has his name on the cover!!!  "The Wedding Album" was the BIGGEST rip-off I ever experienced as a Beatles fan and purchaser of all things Beatle.  When this album came out in 1969 it was priced HIGHER than a regular album because it was a big box!  The graphics for this product HAD to cost more than the recording costs.  The recording part of this project was interminable and amateurish.  Feel like hearing John & Yoko calling each other by their first names for a half hour?  Feel like hearing "home audio" of every inane bit of their "bed-in for peace?"  I sometimes think the most "conceptual" thing John & Yoko could've done with this project would have been giving the customer an EMPTY box!  It probably would've sounded better.    Buying the CD version of "The Wedding Album" seems bizarre.  The product was designed for vinyl and you lose so much graphic presentation in the CD format.  The only blessing in the CD version is the inclusion of three actual SONGS.  However, the three actual songs are Yoko's.  So maybe it's not that big a blessing after all.  All three tunes were B-sides to Plastic Ono Band singles.    I don't recommend buying ANY of John & Yoko's "conceptual" albums.  Do yourself a favor and make one of your own!! 
 With the amount of time Card spends on the reprodutive abilities of aliens, I seriously begin to doubt him. This book had potential, up unto the point where the girl started lusting after bugs. EW! EW! EW! This book was incredibly horrible, especially towards the end and just plain wrong. I suppose if someone having sex with bugs appeals to you then you should read this book but otherwise, STAY FAR FAR AWAY 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
   I enjoyed reading it, but I didn't find it very helpful. I have shown dogs only 3 years and found this book not very good. The guy talked to much about min games and psychology if you ask me.   I wouldn't ever spent money on it, but it was a fun book to read. If it's at your library get it.   I willn't suggest paying more then a few bucks for it.   If you really want a good book read: "Making it to Westminster" it's loaded with information and great to read, you willn't be able to put it down 
 This book is inexplicably influential, probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title. Barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis, instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on Earth that he disagrees with. Barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world, while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness. Interestingly, Barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance, using each other's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior. That is a fascinating thesis, which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating.   The first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists, of cultural trends that Barber disdains, in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary. It's all tied together with attempts at "edgy" pop culture references, made-up terminology (like the annoying "infotainment telesector"), and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping. All is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term "McWorld," which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless. In his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses, Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior, or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days, or both. In the second part of the book, Barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots, in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states. His umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term "Jihad." Note that this book was published back in 1995, so that word was not as prevalent in Western discourse as it is now, but Barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout Muslims and ardent anti-Islamists.  When it comes to the specifics, many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in Barber's arguments, and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task. You can agree or disagree with various critiques of Barber's contentions based on your own personal politics. But everyone will probably conclude that in this book's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis (embodied in the book's title), and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector. Overall, this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 The Jellifish is no replacement for a twelve string guitar. You can not play it fast, it is fragile, and the tone is scratchy. That being said it can be used to make some interesting sounds for color in rhythm and slow lead playing. It is not something I would use often. My 1.00 mm Clayton feels and sounds great after after a few minutes of playing the Jellifish. After one hour of use the Jellifish is starting to show signs of wear and tear. So don't say you weren't warned.     
   I have to say the quality of the movie as far as picture and sound is just about perfect. I however didnt laugh at all during the whole movie. It is predictable and full of stupid characters. I guess its for fans only 
 Cumings is curious because not only does he virulently advocate an anti-Western position, but he also enjoys the use of sources closed to most others...those of the North Koreans. Unfortunately, this unbalanced  revision does not meet the criteria most solid academic historians require  within their writing 
 This book was sent to me by a well-meaning relative. I started reading it about a month before I gave birth and could not get past the judgemental tone of the book. It made it seem like you are a bad Mother if you decide to ween your child or decide to have anything but a drug-free, natural birth. The whole book read like an advertisement for the Le Leche League. I had every intention of breastfeeding, and still do. But reading this made me reluctant to attend any of the La Leche League meetings or calling them for help 
 I give this book a low rating because of the misinformation that Nicholas Wade has presented and in the manner it was presented, "DNA and the Secret Family of Thomas Jefferson." This most difinitive "unproven" statement leads the unsuspecting reader to believe that he "seems" to know so much about genetics and early man that he knows all about the Jefferson-Hemings DNA Study and for what "reason" he sees fit to include it into a serious scientific book as being very suspect as mentioned by some reviewers. He seems to not associate science and truth together as it pertains to the Jefferson-Hemings controversy. Unless I overlooked it, I saw no reference to the excellent work that genetist  Spencer Wells is performing for National Geographic Socity.  I assisted this study by providing access to Jefferson DNA  sources. The result of a match was found in the early Phoenicians,(Caanites mentioned in the bible)and in lands that today are Syria and Lebanon.    From what I know of the study (I assisted Dr. E.A. Foster with the DNA study), Mr. Wade's analysis of this is extremely limited, in fact, it is extremely biased. "Thomas Jefferson fathered an unacknowledged family with his slave mistress Sally Hemings" (pg 257). What truthful fact does he have to give this statement? He makes the most of giving details by lying James Callender and lying Samuel Wetmore/Madison Hemings in Pike Co., Ohio. Why the details in a book topic such as this? I will give you serious readers on the serious DNA topic my opinion. As you may see in my several reviews of other biased books, these authors know nothing of the details of the DNA Study but spread old early biased media tales. He did not inform you that a team of blue ribbon scholars (13 senior professors) for the Scholars Commission ([...]) and determined that there is no proof that Jefferson is guilty of these charges. You may read on my web page: www.angelfire.com/va/TJTruth all the details of this study.   He cannot plead ignorance of the details because I sent him my research early in the media blitz and any reporter not using the many search engines to thoroughly search a subject is most suspect in my opinion. Can any serious researcher read his book and believe he/she is receaving accurate knowledge. My knowledge of the other topics he has written about is limited, BUT I do know this Jefferson-Hemings Study and he has done no current or original research. He references Annette Gordon-Reed as some type of "authority" on the controversy. She was charged by the Scholars Commission Report as having completely rearranged a letter from Jefferson's grand-daughter to give a negative meaning to her words. To add insult to his otherwise feeble attempt to influence your thinking, Wade has a figure with the title, "Thomas Jefferson Family with Sally Hemings.(Pg.260-261)." His lack of knowledge of Sally Hemings and Thomas Jefferson is most lacking in current research because he goes into details that Martha Jefferson and Sally Hemings are half-sisters (an old political rumor brought forward by people wishing to confuse readers and to be politically correct.   He does not mention a very scholarily book by Dr. and Mrs. James McMurry, "Anatomy of a Scandal, Thomas Jefferson and the Sally Story", who did deep research on this rumor and found it a lie designed to fit earlier political mud slinging. Since he did not give the reader another source for study, another VERY interesting book, "Jefferson Vindicated, Falacies, Omissions,and Contradictions in the Hemings Genealogical Search", I will tell you it has a foreword by former Monticello Director, James A, Bear, Jr. All of the named books, including, "The Jefferson-Hemings Myth" are available through Amazon.   I do agree with Wade's last sentence on the Jefferson-Hemings controversy......."Some mysteries lie beyond the power of even DNA to resolve." I might add that contrived history is intertwined with DNA and even the Hemings will NOT permit the gathering of "another" Hemings DNA source.....only ONE originally tested.

 I discovered Dunning and immediately read the first two mysteries.  They were wonderful as my reviews indicate.  I was anxious to start The Bookman's Promise.  I tried but it just never got going.  Other reviewers have described the book so I will not repeat the story.  I can not figure out why there really is any interest in the story. The book lags and the long historical section does not move the story forward.  One part of the series that is getting tiresome is that everyone who is favorable is a book lover.    I will take a break now from Dunning before I continue with the series.  
 This book didn't do it for me. It has a lot of overview, theory, selective details and glancing personal accounts--but all of it in a tone of an infomercial. The problem is that this way of approaching any subject rarely gets people to achieve the goals that Pink urges us on to. Instead, it continues an ongoing addiction to self-help books which may be the next silver bullet to our woes. . . but most often it's not.  He takes a broad survey of a lot of fields, grabs bits of information and formulates it into theories about being a free agent. Having been a grunt-work temp, a freelancer, and now a homeschooling mom (free-agent education), the descriptions seem less-than-rigorous and his conclusions are overdone. Zeal is a powerful force and Pink has lots of it. But it's a force that hasn't matured and mellowed into evenhanded understandings which are brought by in-the-trenches personal experience. And that is what a lot of us need to join the free-agent world 
 I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.  I feel like the characters have lost their voices.  The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books.  Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books.  I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone.  I tried to start the next book, and it was worse.  Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series.  
 In the right hands this novel could be translated into an exciting movie.  The premise is interesting, but falls completely flat with the sewn up ending.  A true happily ever after, that begs for a more smartly written sequel in which everything unravels would be delicious.  The hardest aspect to swallow was that this super extra terrestrial life form could divide out of control then just be neatly killed and carried to a lab in the desert for benevolent study.  Sheesh!  I really thought it was going to get scary at some point! The major antagonist of the story is a tattoed up ex inmate who fancies himself a master mind killer-when in reality he is just a sharpshooting (except when it really counts) boob!  And boy does he meet his match in a simple pair of desert folk, who happen to be expert gunslingers and survivalists to boot!  This is all very funny, but to me the funniest part of the entire book is the description of the male tyrannasaur mounting the female and trumpeting loudly in the wild prehistoric world he inhabits!!!! 
 What age range is the book appropriate for?  Poor Horton -- They beat him.  They maul him.  And try to cage him.  And threaten to boil the dust speck in Beezle-Nut juice just to teach him a lesson.  My poor 5 year old looked at me with sad eyes, and asked, "why?"  Not the best bed-time story 
 Not much here to help novices and certainly not for anyone with the vaguest idea of how scripts "work."  Very skimpy with examples.  There's so much "nuts-and-bolts" knowledge that's necessary to create a good script or treatment, and this book provides little of it 
 Well, if you can't blame anyone else, blame the Gypsies.  Dennis Marlock is doing very well probably, using Gypsies as his career enhancer. However, replace Gypsies with Jews, Hispanics, Blacks, Asians, and you would have a  libel lawsuit on your hands. Dennis, keep talking about Gypsies, and you  true racism continues to show through 
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 Solutions are sometimes even more abstruse than the problems and concepts themselves.  Someone got lazy writing out these solutions!  Plus, more than half the problems are not solved in this book.  Not worth $34 in my opinion 
 The idea of this book -- a collection of short stories that explore the rich phenomenon of why people ride motorcycles -- is terrific; but the execution is disgusting. Anyone genuinely clueless and curious about why people ride would get a perverse enlightenment from SHE'S A BAD MOTORCYCLE. Just one story from a Hell's Angel perspective would have been plenty. Instead, most of the selections are from motorcycle gang members who are too busy bragging about raping, terrorizing, torturing, and pillaging to bother with good writing. Few ever get around to the subject of what motorcycle riding means to them.  Zanetti also seems to have trouble finding a ride out of California. The other 49 states are severely under represented.  The only reason this book is worth even 2 stars is that it includes a couple token gems that deserve far better company. Entries from Melissa Holbrook Pierson, Robert F. Fulton, and a handful of others aren't enough to make the book worth buying; but they are well worth reading on their own 
 	Sally Denton's Faith and Betrayal is a disappointing book. It promised all the elements of an exceptionally dramatic (and true) story: love and loss, wealth and poverty, dedication and disillusionment, an epic journey, a peculiar religion, polygamy, theocracy, a massacre, and perhaps betrayal. But Denton's account is so replete with inaccuracies and confusion of facts that it destroys all credibility. Listing her errors would take nearly as many pages as the book itself. In addition she failed to use the richest repository of primary sources of Mormon history-the LDS Church Historical Department Archives. Presumably this is because she assumed she would not be welcome, she believed the records there had been selectively censored, or she thought they would have little relevance.  	As a non-Mormon historian working on the stories of disillusioned converts in the same period of the mid-nineteenth century, I can assure her that for the past decade I have never been refused generous help in the Church Archives and have found the records there amazingly rich, especially the correspondence of Brigham Young and the diaries of contemporaries of those who left the church.  	Denton makes Jean Rio's piano a pivotal issue, which she says was brought to Utah in 1851, though Jean Rio never mentions it in her trip diary nor does the captain of the company she traveled with in his (which is in the Church Archives). Denton fails to give a source for her account of it. It is quite possible Jean Rio ordered the piano later after her arrival in Salt Lake and had it shipped from the East. As for the tar-covered crate (p. 165), if that is in a museum in California, could not have Denton done the research to find where it is?  	Was Jean Rio's piano taken by the church leaders through "consecration"-a rule of stewardship (pp. xvii, 129)? Did Denton bother to inquire in the Church Archives what the consecration records show? Not all records survived, but many did. It is unlikely the church purged them of information about the piano. Likewise, did Denton ever ask the staff at the Museum of Church History and Art about the provenance of the piano? One Jean Rio descendent believes it was gifted to the museum by a Mormon descendant. Here again Denton confuses her facts: She states (p. 130) that the piano is in the "Church Temple Museum"; there is no such institution.  	Denton claims the piano ended up in the "Amelia Palace, the home of Young's favorite wife, a beautiful Englishwoman named Ann Eliza Webb Dee Young Denning..." (p. 129). Here Denton has all too typically confused Young's so-called "favorite" wife Harriet Amelia Folsom with a later wife, Ann Eliza. Neither were English. The Gardo House, the so-called "Amelia's Palace," was not finished until after Brigham Young's death; Amelia lived in it a short period to establish her claim in Young's will, while Ann Eliza never lived there.  	Denton quotes from one of my papers (pp. 153-54), and although the quote is correct, she misinterprets my account, stating "The flow of Mormon defectors had become the largest emigration to that point, far surpassing even the California gold rush." No records can support that idea. Likewise, she claims that "U.S. Army escorts oversaw a burgeoning traffic of disaffected Mormons fleeing Zion." There was only one such escort from Salt Lake of approximately forty families.  	Although a beautifully produced little book, publisher Alfred A. Knopf should be embarrassed at having accepted and published such a consistently unreliable "history." I'm sorry to advise potential readers not to waste their money 
 My 7 1/2 year old daughter tried these on at a friend's house yesterday.  SHe had them on for about 2 minutes before she fell and got hurt.  After a trip to the ER and the Orthopedic Surgeon, she has a fracture in her growth plate.  Need I say more 
 I was very disappointed to find that most of chapter 5 "Genetic Engineering" was incomplete. The chapter was cut off (on page 80) and was followed by a repetition of page 49-80. Chapter 6 "Why we should Worry" had been left out and the beginning of chapter 7 "Human Rights" (page 105-113) was missing as well. It was very important for me to work on precisely these (missing) chapters at exactly this moment in time, so I am of course quite dissatisfied with the quality of this particular product.  
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 It's big, apparently tough for outdoor play, but for a nearly 3 year old, very limited in what can be done with it.  Even as an adult, I found that the crane mechanism was difficult to manipulate and the hook system was impractical to use for anything.  Ours came with a bunch of heavy paper construction blocks you put together, intended to use with the crane hook, but they don't fit on it, so they're useless.  Plastic tabs are on some of them to insert the hook rail in to, but even that isn't very functional.  Crane winding knob is too difficult for small child also.  With only 3 big Tonkas available now for kids to play with outside, this is a big disappointment in the set.  Only the Mighty Dump Truck is really a good toy for kids, as even the loader has little going for it.  Crane is definitely the worst, though.  Not the Tonkas of my youth, that's for sure 
 My baby slid both down and off the side of this.  I thought it would be a good positioner because it was elevated, but instead the right bumper which is detachable does not securely fasten onto the base, rather it acted as a swivel and I found that my baby had her head hanging off the side of the positioner.  I am involved in a SIDS research study and this product alarms me!  She could have suffocated!  I am trying to contact the company to report this item...please do not buy 
 When i stumbled upon this book in the library, i decided that it looked interesting enough to read. As soon as i got home, i read it all the way through, and was not impressed in the least. As i look at everyone elses reviews, i am confounded as to how this book has garnered so much praise. i have no idea why this is considered a classic, or why it is published by Modern Library. It doesn't deserve it. If you want a good book about homosexuality, read Giovanni's room by James Baldwin. Don't waste your time, as I did, on a book that fails even to elevate itself above bad soft-core porn 
 Heinlein is a great author.  When he sits back and tells a story, he's one of the best.  Glory Road and Citizen of the Galaxy are wonderful, and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress should be on the shelf of any science fiction fan.  This, however, is an awful book.  It's not merely one of Heinlein's worst.  It's one of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read.  The problem isn't that there's no action, although there isn't.  The problem is that there isn't anything of substance to replace it.  There's lots of sex, but not in enough detail to be titilating.  There isn't a love story either; you can't have romance or sexual tension when your characters will sleep with anyone and everyone for any reason.  The book just rambles aimlessly until it ends.  Maybe Heinlein was trying for an examination of gender roles and sexual identity, but if so he failed miserably.  The characters in this book aren't just from a different culture; they aren't people at all.  They're too flat.  If you want to think about such things, ponder them on your own or read a different book.  I suggest Left Hand Of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin.  I Will Fear No Evil reads like an old man's rambling personal fantasies.  Someone must like it, but I can't recommend it even to the most devoted Heinlein fans.  If you're tempted, do yourself a favor and re-read Stranger In A Strange Land instead 
 There might be some great recipes in this book, but it's so poorly organized you'll never find them!  All of the recipes are grouped by what time of day you might eat that particular food.  Seven time frames, such as, Early Bird Specials, 4:00pm-7:00pm; sit-down suppers, 7:00pm-9:00pm; etc.  The front of the book has a list of the recipes in each section - but even that list in a completely random order.  There is no other way to look up recipes.  This is the only cookbook I've ever come across that does not have an index.  So, imagine you have chicken breasts, and you think, "I'll check Rachael's cookbook" - you can't look up 'chicken'.  You can't look up anything.  Even skipping the 7:00-11:00am breakfast section, you still have 6 "time zones" of recipes to browse through, one recipe at a time. Why bother?  You could pick up any other cookbook in your collection and find a chicken recipe in a matter of seconds!  I like Rachael Ray, but the unconventionality that could have made this cookbook truly unique has, in actuality, rendedered it somewhat useless. 
 "Over done" is the best way to describe this over-the-top attempt to view gang life from the eye of a "stolen" video camera.  
 I did not like it. It is a bad story. Wolfs are not bad like in the story. Peter doesnt listen to his grandpa, so it is a bad example 
 This book is not about dreams, so if you want to know about dreams, you should get "The Dream Book" instead.  I don't understand this book 
 One of the other customer reviews for this book (which may have been removed by now because I have complained about it) says: "This book has been updated to include the 4.1 version, a big improvement over the old book which covered 3.0 or maybe 3.1."  But clearly, that customer was referring to the 2nd Edition of the book - this book that you are looking at is the First Edition; in other words, it IS the old book which only covers version 3.1. I know, because I just bought it for $20 and now I will throw it away and buy the 2nd Edition 
 Star Parker should be ashamed of herself.  She has completely lost touch with her identity.  After reading this book I came away with the impression that she hates her own race and buys into the stereotype against her own.  She puts herself on a soap box like she's the answer to it all and anyone that does not agree with her is less than deserving.  She doesn't realize that she was blessed enough to not get thrown in jail for all of the times she broke the law.  She believes the hype about african americans in prision are all guilty.  Her race should be ashamed of her!!!!!!!!!!!   Mrs. Clarence Thomas.  Plus she brags about how she married white like it's some type of gift from god.  He may be a nice man but she fails to realize that he was looking for a warm bed and a hot meal.  Star the laughs on you 
 The gameplay is just foolish and found the game annoying and un-fun!  The kids didn't even like it. Run, don't walk away from this dentist-office of a game JAWS-cr@p. (JAWS = Just another W. Smith 
 I know that I will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... This is one of only 2 books that I have ever read that I truly REGRET devoting the time to , but once I start a book I always finish.I don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this.  I just don't get it.  The main character was quite annoying to me and the story was SO SLOW and predictable I really just wanted it to end. I would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you I am sorry.   
 I just wanted to give an update on my progress.  I cannot, with good conscience, support Diane's program any longer.  I am currently weight training, doing cardio, and eating healthy.  Eating healthy is not eating whatever you want.  In 12 weeks, I brought my risk factor for heart disease down from 5.9:1 (which is horrible) to around 3 (which is nonexistent risk).  I did it with exercise and eating right.  I also lost two sizes with just a 12 pound scale loss because I was gaining muscle, too.  To be healthy, you have to work at it!  Sure, you can lose weight eating whatever you want if you eat less - at least up to a point.  But who wants to be a skinny fat woman or a skinny fat man?  Wouldn't you rather be healthy and have a fabulous physique?  Try Body for Life by Bill Phillips.  Also check out the www.bodybuilding.com website for inspiration, education, and good products 
 Tipler says many times "as I have proved".  Huh? What the f is he talking about?  There is no proof in this stinking pile of filth.  He's got an abundance of physics in the back of the book-I'd like to hear from a physicist if any of that crap makes any sense, but I don't think it should matter.  I am intelligent enough to understand basic physics concepts, and Tipler just doesn't make any sense.  His writing is so bad that anyone who reads this entire thing will have wasted a colossal ammount of time.  The more books you read, the sooner you know when to stop reading, put the book down, and read a work of fiction instead, which can play with such ideas without boring you to death 
 I started this novel with high hopes....expecting something better  than some self proclaimed thrillers I had recently inflicted myself with, but it was not to be.The plot is simplistic and the protagonist blunders from one accident to another.He only manages to succeed in the end due to an unbeliveable set of good luck and stupidity on part of the villians.  While reading the novel there was a strong sense of deja vu .... of having been there and done that, especially with respect to the character of Dr Hemlock.There is very little that is original or likable about him.  In my opinion Ian Fleming wrote infinitely better novels of this genre, viz. spy thrillers, I have yet to come across any author with a better command over language and creator of more interesting characters than him.  My search continues..... 
 they are a lovely color, but I don't like the fact they aren't zippered.  They slip off constantly 
 I'm sorry, but this movie is clearly nothing more than and overdramaticized and historically inaccurate retelling of the story much more riotiously and enjoyably portrayed in the film "Dick." "Dick" is funny, this is not. I'm sorry, but Dustin Hoffman simply does not have the acting chops to stand up to someone like Kirsten Dunst (or that level of indefatigable cuteness).  Just go rent "Dick" instead. You'll thank me, yourself, and those fine ladies who saved our country 
 I found this story to be extremely elementary.  This Shakespeare fellow obviously has no idea what he is talking about, and I hope he refrains from releasing anything in the near future 
 Jeremy Narby's The Cosmic Serpent: DNA and the Origins of Knowledge, started out decently enough with Narby reminiscing about his days doing field work in the Amazon Basin and from there he goes over some interesting ideas regarding DNA and Serpent Myths but then all goes down hill as he suddenly becomes a follower of Intelligent Design and makes an all out attack on Darwinian Evolution and Science itself.  A number of Narby's ideas regarding DNA and Shamanism are intriguing enough but he has apparently decided that all Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology, while he freely admits that he is being very reductionist on this point, I still see many problems with his view that Shamanism is based on Molecular Biology at heart. His argument mostly surrounds the symbol of the Serpent/Dragon which is present in many different mythologies often with connections to water and associations with twins. He decides that this is in actually a representation of DNA as viewed by Shamans and believes that all serpents in mythology and shamanic visions are actually DNA. Since DNA emits photons and this has been shown to possibly play a part in cell communication (along with the traditional chemical communication) Narby believes that in shamanic trances the shaman becomes able to see the light emitted by DNA (which often show up as snakes) and the shaman communicates with the individual bits of DNA (which is conscious) and the entire linked network of DNA based life. As justification for this argument he points out that some groups hold that spirits are beings of pure light, to him this is almost literally correct as the spirits are actually DNA and communicate through light as "spirits".  From there he goes on to say that all ladders, staircases, and ropes in shamanic quests are representations of DNA and when the shaman uses them he is travelling along DNA and similarly when the shaman goes to the underworld he is sinking down to the world of Molecular Biology (although since one can apparently work with and see DNA in the middle world one must ask why one would need to shrink down). While these views might make for some interesting theological discussion about some shamanic practices, Narby seems to have ignored the psychological aspects of visions and quests and any elements other than snakes or other things that just happen to be long and thin. Given Narby's view of spirits as DNA one must ask what spiritual helpers/allies are? Is someone's spiritual guides DNA in some bacteria on my hand? Will I kill Yahweh by washing my hands with anti-bacterial soap (hey maybe that's why Jesus decided that washing one's hands was bad!)?  A lot of his proof is like the proof of Erich von Dï¿½niken except that where Dï¿½niken saw aliens and spacecraft, Narby sees DNA and Molecules. Take for example this Dï¿½niken-esque proof from the book:  "The second was a rock painting of the Rainbow Snake. I looked at it more closely and saw two things: All around the serpent there were sorts of chromosomes, in their upside-down "U" shape, and underneath it there was a kind of ladder!" (p. 79)  By Chapter 10, entitled Biology's Blind Spot, Narby has decided that Evolution is Wrong and all of Science must be toppled. This bit seems to have come out of nowhere like someone spliced a Pro-Intelligent Design rant into a book where it didn't belong and as with all Pro-ID and Creationist literature we get the same old faulty attacks again and again. Attacks such as Evolution being based on a Circular argument because the most fit species survive to spread their genes and therefore are more fit. Yes, that is the definition of fitness, and sometimes the basis of things start as tautologies such as the Theory of Gravity but like Gravity Natural Selection and evolution is justified and testable by looking at it's predictive power. Population genetics and mathematics shows clearly that natural selection is very predictive and has so far not been falsified. Similarly, we can also look at the fossil record in geological strata for evidence of evolutionary change over time.  After that attack Narby then attacks the Central Dogma (Which is how transcription of DNA to proteins works) by misinterpreting what Francis Crick meant. Crick never meant the word Dogma in Central Dogma to be taken in the sense it is used in religion instead he meant it as a joke name for a grand hypothesis that he had at the time little actual experimental evidence for. Narby misinterprets Crick's joke to argue that evolution is apparently Faith based, since this argument has no basis in reality it falls flat immediately.  He then argues that ants and other animals are fully conscious because they do amazing things that seem to require forethought and they tap into DNA like shamans to do things. Higher animals are smart and may have consciousness but ants are pretty dumb. One is reminded of Edward Selous and others' ideas about thought-transference to explain how flocks of birds move and how ants and termites build hives, as it turns out birds flocking behaviour operates on simple instinctual rules (clustering, maintaining speed, and appropriate distance) and so are Ant Nesting behaviours. One proof of this is to put food just out of the reach of ants, and some dirt underneath, while they understand how to move earth and tunnel they will never purposely move earth to build ramps, bridges, or tunnels to reach a goal. The birds who flew in flocks and the ancestors of ants who had developed nesting behaviour managed to survive better and so these behaviours somehow became instincts and persisted.  Now Narby makes the extremely tired argument that life is too complicated to be determined by chance alone, and he is correct on this matter. Too bad there is more than chance guiding evolution, we also have Natural Selection guiding the process, to quote Richard Dawkins: "Life results from the non-random survival of randomly varying replicators." The combinations which work survive and prosper and are kept in the population. Narby argues "How can a small telephone directory of information emerge from random processes?" (P. 142) to answer this I wish to quote a bit of Michael Shermer's 25 Creationists' Arguments and 25 Evolutionists' Answers which nicely illustrates how natural selection can produce Shakespeare's Hamlet quickly from random letters:  "Natural selection is not "random" nor does it operate by "chance." Natural selection preserves the gains and eradicates the mistakes. The eye evolved from a single, light-sensitive cell into the complex eye of today through hundreds if not thousands of intermediate steps, many of which still exist in nature. In order for the monkey to type the first 13 letters of Hamlet's soliloquy by chance, it would take 26 to the power of 13 number of trials for success. This is 16 times as great as the total number of seconds that have elapsed in the lifetime of the solar system. But if each correct letter is preserved and each incorrect letter eradicated, the process operates much faster. How much faster? Richard Hardison constructed a computer program in which letters were "selected" for or against, and it took an average of only 335.2 trials to produce the sequence of letters TOBEORNOTTOBE. This takes the computer less than 90 seconds. The entire play can be done in about 4.5 days!"  Narby also tries to argue that gaps in the fossil record such as in whale evolution and other places where there are few or no intermediate forms indicate that evolution has not occurred. This however just means that in this instance there are gaps in the fossil record because the fossils have not been found yet. Narby also points to the seemingly rapid appearance of species in the fossil record as an argument against evolution. Apparently Narby has never heard of Punctuated Equilibrium.  Narby stunningly also tries to argue that because large portions of DNA is identical over many different species that this somehow indicates design, unfortunately for Narby a lot of these identical sequences of DNA code for the basic processes of life. A human who couldn't cope with oxygen or a fox which could not metabolize energy would not last long in this world. The fact that these sequences are identical is actually a point for evolution because the same processes have been preserved and we even see similar basic skeletal structures in animals even when it is not efficient or useful such as digits in the fins of dolphins or the appendix in humans.  Finally, we come back full circle to his argument about Natural Selection being a form of circular logic and he ties to paint Evolution as unfalsifiable (No, we can test it's predictions in such fields as Genetics and Palaeontology) and being denounce by an increasing number of scientists (not at all true).  All in all while Narby has some interesting nuggets of information and ideas in The Cosmic Serpent he ultimately seems to squander these ideas by jumping around in random directions and to strange conclusions based on very little evidence 
 HOOGIE MANE FACE UR FACTOR FOR ON JUST DROP SHY CHINAMAN UP TO  DANC 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 and very dissapointed with the latest book.  I was hoping for HOUSEY pictures.  I want what she is known for...... decor & pictures of beautiful rooms with beautiful one of a kind treasures. I would love to have seen homes or rooms she has done for clients. Or from her new home. This book just felt like a dissapointing waste of time.  I can't believe anyone would be interested in seeing what Pamala Anderson did for her SONS birthday party. What I really would have liked to have seen is what she does for childrens room, master bedrooms, living rooms, family rooms, kitchens,  This was dissapoiting 
 It is not my intent to write an unhelpful, "bashing" review.  I have a decade of management experience, and this simply is not a good book.  Why?  Well, the great religions of the world use short parables to teach lessons, and this book also operates in parable form (the people and situations in the book are made up).  Instead of delivering the message of the book in one or two paragraphs in order to teach the lesson, which is entirely possible for the lesson being taught, the lesson is drug out for about 180 pages with the express purpose of selling books and delivering a feel good message.  Many of the other reviewers here who also did not like the book point to many worthwhile references that I will not repeat here.  Overall, the lessons in this book are equivilant to those learned in a a high school Introduction to Business class. 
 Let me see if I have got this right? The only way to organize the economy is the capitalist way? That way we all gain? OK the bosses of Nike, McDonalds, and Wal-Mart will gain a bit more than us ordinary folk, but our little boats will rise with the flowing tide?  Sounds good: who would want to be the party pooper?!  Well someone's got to be, and for the simple reason that we don't live on a planet the size of Jupiter.   The oil's finite: we know that but can't be bothered to act on it. Even the supply of water is turning out to be finite: the south east of England is on a collision course between an expanding population and a diminishing supply of water. OK, they could ship it in from the rest of the UK where there's no problem, but for reasons that don't quite add up that's not possible. It's not the corporate solution, if you will forgive the pun.  Has it occurred to anyone, I wonder, if it's capitalist-driven growth which is at the heart of the upcoming problems? Yes, I know Marx and Stalin don't offer any fixes, but at some point along the way the problem is going to have to be faced: growth is going to wind-down whether we like it or not.  
 I searched all over to find a book specifically about voodoo in New Orleans, and unfortunately this was all I could find...it's only 240ish pages and I still haven't even made it through it yet. Though there are  some interesting facts, I think it's poorly written -- and it's 50 years  old!  Would like to see a more updated version that is a better read.   Maybe will write it myself 
 Okay, I had to read this book for a Fantasy Lit. class I am taking.  My teacher and all of my fellow classmates, it seems, find it hilarious.  I, however, am left wondering:  why?    I understand what he's getting at with religion and what not, I've just seen it done in a much better way by much better authors.  The characters are boring and flat.  His humor is downright stupid.  This book is not clever in the least.  If you don't know the things he's pointing out in a way which suggests he thinks they are quite witty, you really need to think for yourself.    I guess it might appeal to the great masses who can find nothing better to do with their time than go to the next big blockbuster movie and buy the latest crap novel.  But then, the back of the book does say he is a popular author, and like most things that are popular, it must be accessible to the public or else they won't understand.     
 I really don't like boston that much. they are kind of overrated and lousy. One of the worst songs I have ever heard is More than  a feeling and i don't get it why people like it. The only 2 good songs are Foreplay, and Smokin. The rest of this is junk. I love the cover anyway. 
 For the most part, these people whom the author thought are prominent Jews are either ignoramuses  as regards to Judaism and our heritage (especially the 2 Supreme Court Justices, who probably never heard of the concept of tzeddek) or are not even Jewish at all. A waste of time 
 Lived by the sea. Ok--that is how creative this book i 
 Do not buy this or any item from Baby Age.  Their customer service is horrible.  Amazon should remove all of their listings 
 This book really wasn't for me.  It's the same tripe as 101 other books of the genre.  Although, it might be useful to the right person.  I'd happily recommend it as a gift for a teenager, or anyone who doesn't usually read books.  The book reads a lot like the "Chicken Soup for the Soul" series, with quirky quotes and anecdotes, but very little substance.  On the bright side, after reading Chomsky or Neitzche, McWilliams is a comic relief 
 My daughter had a drink and wet doll that she could give a bath but it filled up with water and even though you couldn't empty all the water out, it still leaked everywhere. I got rid of it hoping she wouldn't notice. Well, she did, so a new "doll I can give a bath to" was on her Christmas list. I wanted to find a solid rubber doll that would not fill up with water. Like the dolls I had as a child. I thought this would be it since the top half visible in the box appeared to have no holes. Wrong. It has a soft torso filled with polystyrene beads that get waterlogged. The water all (I hope) drains out of the bottom of the feet after a couple of minutes of squeezing. Then you have to let the torso drip dry. Last night after bathtime, my daughter wanted to tuck her doll into to the doll cradle, but couldn't because she was still wet.  The other features are fine. The shower works great. You don't have to fill up the fish. Just attach it to the tube and squeeze. It suctions water from the bottom of the floaty. The doll doesn't sit upright in the floaty, but she doesn't flop completely over, either.  I don't care for the bow sewn on to the head. Who takes a bath with a bow on? But if you take it off, she'll have holes in her head 
 I recently purchased this book thinking that I would be getting some new tips in sleight of hand, which I did, but with much aggrevation.  If you are a beginner I would not recommend this book.  It's books  like this that will make people turn away from magic.  The concepts are good in this book, but the drawings are difficult to match with the instructions.  The drawings and the explanations can cause a great deal of frustration and make one want to pass on tricks all together.  Most of the stuff in this book is covered in Mark Wilson's book (which has 10 times better pics and explainations), so if you want just a few more tricks then get it, but altogether I wish that I hadn't bought it.   The only real good thing about this book is that it has some good cigarette vanishes and a good routine, but it may take you 10 hours o decipher what you are actually looking at.  For beginners...not really...if you are a beginner...go to Mark Wilson.  Cheer 
 These reviews are probably more interesting than the book. What's so interesting about them is that the reviewers don't seem to get that more than two-thirds of the country are now fully aware of Bush's utter incompetence as a leader. The "vast left-wing conspiracy" now consists of a 2/3 majority of the country. Apparently, 1 1/2 years wasn't enough time for a clear majority of voters to figure it all out. But nearly 3 1/2 years later, we all see. This book is a couple of years too late. Today it's utterly ridiculous to denounce a "conspiracy" to reveal the TRUTH 
 I once read a review that used the description "beige-colored realism." That term came to mind immediately after I finished this collection. Haslett's prose is lifeless and flat, his characters self-absorbed and trite. You Are Not a Stranger Here is a perfect example of overly slick hyper-reality. All too often I finished a story and wondered what the point was. Certainly, the language is clean and technically sound, but conveyed no greater substance. Similarly, I consistantly found myself irritated by brick-like moments of artificial poignancy and banal epiphanies ("At last, she feels the warmth of her son's tears in the palms of her hands" and "For a moment, here, in the calm he knows is only the eye of the storm, in the center of a turbulance that, despite everything anyone has ever written or said, might not mean a thing, he can only stare into his friend's gentle face, and listen, with gratitude, to the sounds of the world around him."). Haslett's work exhibits the studied attention to style of a classic creative writing workshop student, but forgets somewhere along the way that the themes of grief and despair are broad and old, and must be handled with care (i.e. freshness and depth), and not treated like dead horses 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 I borrowed this book from the library and I was glad I didn't buy it.   It focusses on the process for making hard, pressed cheeses. I much prefer Ricki Carrols book for acccessible information pertinant to someone making small quantities of lots of different varieties of cheese 
 I was aware that I was buying a miniature edition of the book, and I expected it to be small.  Maybe not this small (3"x3.5"), but small.  But inside there isn't a whole lot of useful information unless you've never drank alcohol before.  There are only about 50 recipies, including stuff like Gin and Tonic, which is like a cookbook containing directions for making broccoli.  I give it a 2 because it has some interesting information on alcohols, and it has some good recipies.  However, the Internet Webtender is a great place for much, much more of both of the above 
 I got this book at the library's used book sale and am definitely glad I didn't pay full price for it.  The plot summary on the back cover sounded interesting, but the book itself did not live up to the description.  I stuck with the book until the last page but only because I wanted to find out how it ended.  I didn't think the characters had much personality and I couldn't get myself interested enough in them to be enthusiastic about following their story.  Not a total waste of time, but I wouldn't recommend it 
 In my opinion I don't suggest this book to kids that are younger that 13 years old because of the language it has and how it tells you that drugs are the only thing that could make you feel better. As well as, how the teenagers made a bad choices in their life. When I finished the book, I felt like drugs is the only thing I need now, which I know is wrong and I'm not even going to take any, but my point is that someone who'll probably finish the book might think that and do it.  This book is basically about two young teenagers Gemma and Tar who decided to run away from home and go to Bristol. Where they met new friends and started taking drugs and making bad choices, but then they started to realize of what they were doing is wrong, but they cannot stop taking drugs, and so this story unfolds of how Gemma and Tar find their way back home, through the path of where some of their friends had died or even went to the hospital and jails for the rest of their lives, but Gemma and Tar work together to make it safe and sound. 
 Thank God. I checked this book out at the library. It would have been a waste of money to buy it. I found it to be boring so I pressed on reading up to chapter 15 but it didn't get any better so the book went back unfinished. I think the controversy around this book was mainly for publicity to get people to buy it. It's so sad that most were disappointed 
 I bought the book for my girlfriend, but found myself without a book to read. I expected to find a nice account of a start-up (I love those kinds of books). I couldn't get past the 2nd chapter. The sugary sweet telling of what MIGHT be a true story; the silly and unrealistic situations; and the contrived dialogue, which I can't imagine coming out or a real person's mouth, forced me to put this down If you are a 14 year old girl you might be drawn to the story, but if you are looking for an business account of how the three dog bakery was started this won't be for you 
 I was suckered into buying this years ago and the sound was so bad that I immediately sold it as used for pennies on the dollar.  I strongly suggest you buy another anthology of their music instead 
 The darn thing broke almost immediately.  When I tried to switch gel covers (it comes with 3 different sizes) the entire earpiece came off in my hands!  What a flimsy piece of crap.  I just sent it back to Amazon. I'm never buying a Jabra product again 
 This item is a rip-off. First, I purchased it to record my favorite HBO shows because I work late. Well, it doesn't record HBO. Second, when I does record a show the DVD recorder takes up to 10 minutes to finalize the DVD and the loss of quality compared to my regular signal is huge. This didn't happen with my less expensive "Lite-on" brand recorder. I guess I should've and will purchase a lower priced item from the competition. Most DO record the shows I need, they record faster and they give me, the consumer to decide if I should or not copy certain shows. Sony is out of my dictionary. 
 When you consider that Mr. Downs does not speak Korean, and has never spoken directly with North Koreans, either on a friendly basis nor in an adversarial sense across the bargaining table, all you are getting here is a second-hand rehash reflecting of the stand-off at Panmunjom.  A serious mirror study of U.S. negotiating tactics there would not be too complimentary.  This book is more about conservative U.S. opinion of the Clinton administration than anything else.  Read Scot Snyder instead 
 I was watching Cinemax one night, bored out of my mind and unable to sleep, when this movie came on.  The acting made me laugh.  The premise made me laugh.  Everything about it made me laugh.  Hey, at least it was fun to make fun of anyway.  Just kinda mad that I wasted a good 80 minutes on this piece of crap 
 Had somewhat higher expectations, given that this was a Lennox. Got the shaker home. tried it out, IT LEAKS. No matter how hard you hold the darn thing together, it leaks. I am a materials engineer so I gave the product a more than cursory examination. VERY, VERY POOR QUALITY.  Also Made in China (if that has anything to do with quality ... hint hint wink wink) DO NOT BUY 
 Ordered this for my 2 year old. I didn't realize it was only about the number 2. I thought it was learning about numbers, part 2 and would involved numbers one through 10. So perhaps this was my mistake. Gets a bit tedious. My 2 year old got bored with it, because he also expected it to cover other numbers 
 First off: I'd like it better if we had 1/2-star options. Judas Unchained really doesn't deserve a 2, more a 2-1/2 or 2-3/4.  I have a love/hate relationship with Peter Hamilton's books. He's very adept at introducing interesting technology and making a faster-than-light society plausible but, as with a lot of these hard-science, libertarian SF authors, he badly needs an editor. I was skipping over multiple pages of irrelevance in both this book and its prequel, Pandora's Star. He also has far too many "main characters" who (despite 800+ pages) never seem to come alive. They all speak with essentially the same voice. And when he tries to individualize someone they come off as badly stereotyped '60s era hippies -- come on, does anyone seriously say "dude" in the real world much less the imagined future of the 24th century?  And why is Hamilton so obsessed with sex with young (or rejuvenated) women?  Hamilton's treatment of virtual immortality is hit and miss at best. On the one hand, the innate conservatism of an immortal civilization is well developed, represented and believable. On the other hand, the dynamics of the relationship between "old timers" and "first lifers" is unsatisfactory. In four centuries, for example, NO ONE has even attempted to unseat Nigel Sheldon from his position as head of the Sheldon dynasty? Perhaps the Commonwealth's continual expansion is the safety valve but even here, the government (controlled the eternal heads of these dynasties) controls it. Another point that is brought up briefly is why would anyone want to live forever if their life didn't change -- I mean the characters of a novel (almost by definition) are dynamic, go-get-'em types but most people just plod through their lives and then die. Why would anyone want to do that for lifetime after lifetime?  The aliens are OK. The problem with them (and this is true of nearly every SF story) is that they tend to be one dimensional -- they're all of a singular type and all too often they really do just act like human beings with weird make up. (This is a problem in fantasy stories, too.) On the plus side, I do tip my hat to Hamilton for not allowing the humans to save themselves with an alien "deus ex machina." Ozzie's adventures in "Wonderland" (i.e., the silfen paths) do bring him to the adult silfen and he does find out the origins of the Dyson barriers but the knowledge doesn't really help anyone defeat the Primes.  Overall, if you started with Pandora's Star, you probably should finish the journey with Judas Unchained. If you haven't started down this "silfen path," I recommend Alistair Reynolds, Tony Daniel or Iain Banks. They write similarly grand space opera but are better at it than Hamilton has proven himself to be to date 
 So this was my first digital camera, got it last july for my birthday. I go to a lot of concerts, so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects. Well, two days after i got it, i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white. It would still take pics, only you couldnt see them. After changing the batteries and turnign it off and on, it went back to normal. Alarmed, i called Samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again. It only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again. But that was only one thing wrong with it. This is a horrible camera for concerts, the pictures are always blurry. Shoot, even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes. Tuesday i went to see my fav band again, and the dumb thing goes white. It woudnt stop, no matter how many times i turned it off and on again. Now the flash is broke and i'm ready to throw it against the wall. You can't trust this camera. You never know when it will take good pics or bad pics.I wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute! 
 I got this book from the library and was reading it with my daughter. The illustrations are wonderful and overall it is a good introductory to evolution for kids. However I find it unbelieveable that the author describes the appearance of the primate/human "common ancestor" as being descended from apes. For someone who thinks himself knowlegable enough to be writing educational books for any age on the theory of evolution this "mistake" is unforgivable.  Considering the idea is the most repeated falsity used by ignorant opponents of evolution. You are not helping to educate children by feeding them ignorance. It`s enough to keep me from reading anything else written by this author 
 I read the stock reviews and then the readers' reviews and could not agree more with Mr. Hauer's reaction.  I cannot understand how anyone who reads very much could tolerate this poorly written book.  Undoubtedly, Mr. Thomson is a font of knowledge on film history, but he needs a writing class badly.  I threw the book down at p. 181.  Try this on for size:  "No doubt, esteemed Renaissance painters and eighteenth century composers were able to carry on their work without distraction.  (All they had to worry about was Inquisition, plague, or sheer loss of favor.)"  The book is full of bizarre, inaccurate rumblings like this - - and that's before you figure out what in the world this weird aside has to do with the history of American film.  A good editor would have advised the author to reduce his dependence on convoluted sentence structure, entertain simple declarative sentences and reduce this mess to a meaty magazine article at best 
 Come on people, let's get real.  How many scientific articles (well controlled studies) were used in this book.  The answer is none!  The segment of the population with cancer, cystic fibrosis, MS etc is completely equal when controlling for the variable of "mercury" silver amalgams.  So using this idiot's logic, silver fillings should also be said to prevent disease.  It is sad to see a man using poor science to get peoples hopes up, just to make some money 
 a great selection of baroque favorites, but the sound quality, especially on the pachelbel canon, not great at all.  for that reason, i cannot recommend getting it.  what do you expect for five dollars, right !>?  i would suggest spending a little more money and getting something that you can't bear to part with, for continued listening enjoyment 
 I'm surprised no other reviewer noticed! Why did Penquin place Ronald Colman and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. prominently on the cover? In this reviewer's opinion, they must secretly realize that the wonderful 1937 classic film vastly outshines the printed word. I found the  story to be poorly written and hard to follow. Its' style is too formal, too flowery and too wordy!	If I had not seen (both) versions of the film, I could not have followed the "action". I constantly referred back to mental images of the movie to orientate myself. A review of "PZ" boils down to a basic truth: While most agree that the book is usually superior, occasionally the movie wins out. "PZ" is a prime example. ("Strangers on a Train" is another!). As for the so -called sequel, "Rupert of Hentzau"- don't even bother, unless you are an Anthony Hope fanatic. Reviewing the book makes one appreciate-once again- that wonderful film fadeout as Ronald Colman rides off over the hill. Since it happens to be available on amazon, click on the movie reviews. Therein will lie the essence of the wonderful adventure story of "The Prisoner of Zenda" 
 It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters.  Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while).  There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had.  The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors.  
 I was a little dissappointed.  This is a funny book, and these are obviously funny guys.  The live show must be outrageous...but then, the live show probably has props.   That's what this book needs.    It's a lot of words....  a lot of funny words, but all crammed in together with no real break.   After about 30 pages, you start to anticipate how each subject will be addressed.  Kind of like this review, after the first part, you know what the rest will be like.  Imagine how much more interesting it would be if Amazon would let me illustrate my review....   imagine what a great book this would have been if they had chosen to use some ILLUSTRATIONS!!!  (If the cover say's "Funny book" when you see it... look at the cover again, and imagine it with just the words and no pictures.. that's the book.  p.s. Yes I often enjoy books without pictures.... but this wasn't one of them 
 Because Hinton's is the first Joni Mitchell biography I've digested, I was hoping for something that didn't leave a cheap, plastic taste in my mouth.  The known parts of her life that are inspiring to me were reduced to banal fodder mentioned in passing, while darker aspects became reasons for the author to step up to her vehement defense--these outbursts were nauseating and usually at the expense of someone else, leaving many questions largely unresolved.  Hinton tends to shuffle back and forth between regurgitation of objective fact and jarring personal opinion.  Incidentally, I like what one reviewer said about this book reading "like a last-minute book report".  The fact that he completely destroys my favorite JM album in his woefully amaturish musical critiques doesn't help either.  This book does not do justice to an artist such as Mitchell 
 I've enjoyed Michael Thomas Ford's writing in the past, but this story is poorly written, poorly edited and extremely shallow.  I couldn't help but think that Ford was just cranking out a story to meet a deadline.  There's no depth of character in any of the main figures.  The story line seems to serve no purpose other than to connect the over abundant and graphic sex scenes, some of which are extremely brutal.  If your looking for a good story with believable characters...keep looking for it 
 I did not like this book what-so-ever.  I didn't care for any of receipes because has it has already been stated, they are not user, family friendly for those with a lifestyle that includes cub scout meetings and baseball games.  The entries regarding her financial lifestyle certainly didn't help either. If you want to read this book either pre or post op I would suggest borrowing a copy, not purchasing.  However I will give the author a point for stressing the importance of protein.  
 This is among the most disappointing Symantec products!!!  When one tries to log in to the infovault, the login box is often empty! There is no way to submit the information.  It is also impossible to get a straight answer from Customer Service. BRING BACK THE OLD PRODUCT, PLEASE!!!!  Have been a Norton customer for years....this one is just not great!! 
 Dick Staub makes some very good points and conections to the training of a Jedi in the ways of the Force in Star Wars and the walk of a Christian following God in life today.  However, he does misquote and misinterpret many quotes from the Star Wars movies, and I even found a misquotation from the Bible.  He makes good points, but these details were distracting to me as I read.   I am not yet finished and will leave more once I am done.  After finishing this book it occured to me that Dick Staub needs to take some time to do a couple of things. First he needs to re-read the Bible and get facts correct (He quoted Moses as saying something to Joshua, but Moses was dead at the time and God told it to Joshua). Second, he needs a simple commentary for the passages he misinterprets (He says David had Uriah killed to be the only one Bathsheba loved, He had Uriah killed to cover up his sin). Third he needs to re-watch the Star Wars movies and not bend the quotes of the characters to fit his book (He talks about Obi-Wan asking Yoda for help in Episode II and portrays the event differently than it happens, as well as bends Yoda's reaction to fit what he is trying to show). This book is not what I thought it was, and any Christian who is young in their walk should not read this. 
 I found this book while trying to find a book I first heard about in the early 80's.  I believe the title was something like "Contact: The First Three Seconds".  I'm hoping someone will read this and assist me with the actual title and/or Author of the book 
 I must say that this versions are not bad at all, but at any rate I prefer the originals. Why? Simply, because this gruop can't match the quality of ABBA. You can't compare the great  Agnetha and Frida's voices with the two singers here. And remember that when ABBA started their career as a group, every member were well known in Sweden as individual artists, that's to say they were experiencied musicians, and this group doesn't appear to be so. In fact, the interpetations here are all danceable, the recording quality is ok, but the whole thing is not as enjoyable as ABBA was.  I will finish this review with a question: can anyone tell me who played the instruments here and what did the two boys here? I'k like to know it since I can't find the credits anywhere on my copy, and the male voices doesn't appear bo be evident on the recording.   
 I just want to let potential marketplace buyers of SALO that the seller: closeoutgoods and other Amazon marketplace sellers are selling pirated (bootlegged) editions of this movie and other Criterion DVDs. If Amazon were legitimate, they would ban these marketplace sellers from their website. Every potential buyer should report these crooks to the FBI and Criterion 
 I was disappointed with these tongs, which was surprising since OXO makes good kitchen utensils.  I agree with other reviewers, it is difficult to grasp and close them.  Unless you have a rather large hand (which I don't), you're forced to grasp the handle so far down near the stainless steel!  When comparing these to my 12" tongs my hand grasp was at the same point - which really made these 16" tongs no different from the 12" ones.  
 I don't understand what the people in charge of producing "The Wiz" as a film, could get by joining the former "BIG" names of Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Richard Pryor and Lena Horne in this trashy picture. The music soundtrack is by far, much better than the movie itself.  I have lately become a great Soul music fan, so I recommend to get the soundtrack album and enjoy it considering it just as a very imaginative Soul music work, not keeping in mind that it's a "movie soundtrack". In such manner you will enjoy it more!       
 I'm reading reviews and I'm beginning to wonder if I even know what's good anymore. I see cats referring to this album as "perfect", "sick", and "excellent" when what I'm hearing is nothing more than "okay."  If you regularly listen to hip hop and you think this is "sick" or "excellent", then you probably haven't been listening to hip hop for very long. Apparently all it takes nowadays for a dude to be considered nice is a decent beat and a borrowed flow. In this case, we're borrowing from some guy named Shawn. I mean, literally, this sounds like Jay Z has a cold and stuffed tissue up his nose before went in the booth (and he had the nerve to make a song like "Mirror Mirror") -- just listen to "A Day In The Life" and you'll know I'm not lying. The production, on the other hand, isn't necessarily bad, but 9th's sound is getting repetitive. I was on the 9th Wonder bandwagon after copping The Listening a few years ago, but now I think I've had my fill. Despite what you may think, EVERY producer has throw away beats and 9th is no exception. This album is proof of that.   With all that said, it would be unfair of me not to point out the good as well as the bad. There are a couple joints on the album where Sky switches up from the "hustler of week" themes and drops something worth hearing. A perfect example of that would be "Extreme Measures", "You & Me", and "Stop Fooling Yourself" -- Sky and 9th both put some effort into what they're doing on those joints. There are a few others, but none really worth mentioning.   Cloud 9: The 3 Day High is pretty much a forgettable release from Skyzoo. I listened to this at least 8 times in hopes I'd hear what everyone else was talking about, but it never happened. My pointer finger hurts from all the skipping I was doing. You really shouldn't have to force yourself to like something. Nor should an album have to "grow" on you (another way of saying you forced yourself to like it because it didn't hit you the first time). Imagine if Illmatic or Liquid Swords had to "grow" on you. If you're one of those people, you're no different from clear channel or any other radio station. They use repetition too. I'd tell you to get this if you were a 9th Wonder fan, but you've heard better from him too. No, the album isn't wack, but it's the audio equivalent of Nyquil. I recommend downloading this and testing it out before actually paying for it.   Standout Tracks: Stop Fooling Yourself (My Favorite), You & Me, and Extreme Measure 
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 This book isn't witty, funny, amusing or enlightening. It's sick and sad. Don't buy it. 
 i am very disappointed with this humidifier and its filter. it consumes about 1 filter per month and if you keep the humidifier off for more than 2 days the filter dries up and you might as well throw it away 
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 I own both the original unbreakable autolock (with the flat key) and the autolock pro (with the round key). The original autolock never failed to open after 10+ years of use on two cars. The autolock pro failed to open after about two years of light use. This is not a key problem, because I could not open it with two original keys. I eventually wiggled the lock a lot to open it. I recommend that you stick with the original autolock if you wish to use this kind of security device 
 I should have read these reviews instead of trusting the KitchenAid name when  I bought this toaster.  From day one, it has never toasted evenly any breadlike substance - fresh / frozen / refrigerated, bread / bagel / english muffin - you name it.  See the photo I uploaded - toast is burnt and raw at the same time!!  Pass on this one 
 Please think this DVD is recorded in 1986. More worse, this is recorded as a documentary. Sound quality is worst. After I bought this and DVD of "Company" (same, worst sound quality DOCUMENTARY), I suspect the word "concert" or "soundtrack" in DVD title 
 I tried to read this book, I really did. I've read a fair amount of epistemology, and I'm reasonably familiar with the issues and positions that characterize the field. And I purchased the book, so I had a financial investment.  But no. I can read Kant, and enjoy doing it, but I couldn't read this. What we have here is a confusingly-written compendium of the terminological quagmire into which modern epistemology has fallen, an elaboration that has yielded very, very little. It's no wonder that scientists and others who actually work and succeed with the things of the world ignore the whole epistemological enterprise as irrelevant.  Audi makes it all worse by omitting the historical context and development of the field, so there is little or no reference to what was at actually at issue to make the questions worth asking. What gave rise to epistemology and made any of it interesting was, of course, the challenge of skepticism; but that's stuck at the end, by which time the poor reader is long past caring.  Epistemology itself looks more and more like a dead end, at least in the way it's being pursued; maybe it's time to begin again, only starting from the ontology end.  However that may be, the history of epistemological debate is fascinating and involves many very challenging and interesting questions, especially when those are considered in historical sequence against the background of the times in which they were raised. There are many excellent introductions to epistemology available that tell that story. This is not one of them. 
 The book is ok.  Its well written, and raises some valid points, however the issue is presented almost totally in an 'America-vs-Islam' context.  The main conflicts Qureshi deals with involve post 9-11 America v certain parts of the Middle East and Israel-Palestine.  Qureshi has missed a major oppertunity to investigate other conflicts which involve Islam.  Why does he not discuss Kashmir, Chechnya, Southern Thailand, Timor, Ughur/Western China?  All of these conflicts have a religous dimension to them, and all of them are often talked about by Radical Jihadists, yet none of them really involve the US or Israel.  His lack of attention to this means his book has just become another generic study which simplifies the whole issue.  Overall it is an ok book, and from an academic point of view it does provide an alternative to Huntingdon's theory.  But sadly it has a narrow scope and leaves too many crucial questions unanswered 
 Plugged it into my wife's car. Set it, listened to 1/2 of a song, then went to remove it to try it in my car. The plug part broke apart in cigarette lighter, leaving part of the plug in the jack. Returned it, Satechi sent my refund quickly 
 Pace was ploddingly slow through the first 14 chapters. Characters weren't engaging enough to warrant finishing this book 
 This tie winder is not only twice the size I was expecting, but it doesn't work.  After one attempted use, the lid no longer stays on.  I would have returned it if the return shipping didn't cost more than the item 
 Women in Love is a well acted film mostly about people who are difficult to like doing things difficult to approve.  To its great credit this Ken Russell film is faithful to the D. H. Lawrence novel upon which it is based 
 ... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.  To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another "blockbuster" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending

 This seemed too long and too drawn out 
 While better than her last 2 books--more rooted in objectivity, perception--here too Graham is so mannered that she cariacatures herself relentlessly; she is, at this stage in her labored career, pure cartoon. One is reminded of Gardner's Faults of the Soul, & cannot help wonder if these poems are the ultimate Frankenstein wrought by the factory poetry system of the MFA: a poetry of preciousness, of hyper-articulated stylistic/typographical *ticks* employed in the hopes of masking a shortfall of intellectual courage & spiritual discovery. If looking to have the top of your head taken off, turn to Hillman or Carson, Brock-Broido or Bidart. The most radical thing Graham could do at this point in her life's arc would be to embrace a decade or so of silence, to not publish every self-reflexive utterance. The other worthy task, one senses,would be to abandon all the stylistic bric-a-brac & hiccuping in favor of language itself, to *dare* to be direct, centered in image, lyric in intent 
 that I even read this book!  Even knowing it's a re-release doesn't help! My sister-in-law and I are avid Plum fans and I guess it will have to suffice to say that we will simply stick to the Plum titles and leave the rest behind.  This book was SO light, I'm surprised it didn't just float away.  I think successful writers should not be so money-hungry that reprinting of old titles becomes the name of the game... JMHO     
 Sounds like the background music used in the 70's Rockford Files TV crime show...and a little like the CHIPS music too. Similar to music by Tom Scott from back then. The crusaders never really get hard funky or dirty funky, they are more smooth groovin funk. The sound for the times is very clean, too produced for true funkyness. Don't get me wrong I like the old 60's JAZZ crusaders, just not this 70's phase of their career...they sold out to a large extent, and continue to do so, it's where the money is.  No improvisatory feel either. This is for smooth jazz lovers. hard funk lovers will be disappointed, as will true jazzers.  I wish the crusaders kept their jazz chops from the 60's but they keep burying it like it never happened, even to this day, afraid to lose sales if they get too musically adverturous like their mid/late 60's true jazz albums. Their 70's albums like this are partly to blame for today's smooth jazz... in other words, not really jazz, not really funky, just kind of smooth groovin, more for casual adults and offices. not challenging, not offensive, formulated to an extent. But hey if you like this, that's cool, just dont think it's real jazz, or real funk. It's smooth and casual, slightly simmers, pleasant background music, but doesn't COOK like so many other groups from the same time period that mixed jazz, funk, and fusion. It just sounds like they are holding back...I know they can play more advanced, and write more creatively, they just choose not to ever since the 60's 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 I bought this book based on a review in Saveur.  It did not give me the information that I wanted and at $50+, I thought that it was very overpriced 
 I'd heard about Curves, and decided to check out this book from the library to decide if I wanted to try out the Curves system. As other reviewers have said, this is Atkins all over again. More than 2/3 of the book is about diet. While there is a SMALL section about the exercises, to be honest, I didn't see an exercise in there that was particularly original. Since I thought this was an exercise program, I was disappointed in the scanty amount of exercise information in the book. I was also disappointed in the Phase III. It requires you to weigh yourself every day to make sure you're not gaining back too much weight, and you go back on a low carb/low calorie diet as soon as you're 5 pounds over what you want to be. I understand the idea, but being chained to a scale is not what I had in mind when it said "without permanent dieting". I know there are people at a healthy weight who don't weigh themselves every day, and I don't think getting fixated on a magical scale number is healthy either. While the metabolism section was somewhat interesting, I just can't get excited about this program 
 Pipi Longstocking  Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren is an inspiring tale about a girl named Pipi. She has a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nelson. Next door are two very polite children named Tommy and Annika and they become friends. I like that I can relate to Annika in that she is always hesitant but after she gets started she doesn't want to stop Pipi's fother is a sea man and left her at the house with a	suitcase full of gold pieces. Pipi likes to go on adventures. One was when Pipi tricked two thieves into leaving her house with nothing This is just one example of the many heroic adventures in this exciting book. I like that it has a moral that is deep so you have fun reading it and you close the book with a smile 
 Being a specialty roaster since 1975 and being part of a local specialty roaster group. I can tell you that starbuck's main accomplishment is their marketing ability. The coffee they distribute is garbage, and this doesn't have to come from my mouth, it comes from people who come to me after tasting their supposed "specialty coffee."  Starbucks lost their specialty status the moment you could find them on every street corner and/or supermarket. Where they beat most is their non stop advertising and brainwashing of people. The reason starbucks got big was because there was noone around to fill that demand, or more importantly, due to the nature of the specialty market, noone who wanted to fill that position.  The amount of coffee they are forced to produce lead to only one scenario, inferior quality.  Concepts of mass production. Economics 101. The higher the demand, the less likely quality is to have influence. 
 I purchased this toy for a friend's dog a while back. The dog loved it, he played with it non-stop (quack! quack!). When he finally destroyed it though we were shocked. Inside of this toy in addition to the stuffing we found a rubber band and parts of a plastic bag. My friend was fortunate enough to get the toy away from the dog before he could consume these items. We did complain to the manufacturer who said they'd look into it, but I would still be wary of this toy.  I think this would be a great toy for a dog that loves it's toys, but doesn't rip them to shreds! There is no guarantee that what you find inside will be safe! 
 This is the perfect show for politically illiterate liberals who need a celebrity to reinforce their trendy, pre-packaged beliefs. Sure, this series bears some [contrived] humor; How convenient that renders it invunerable to criticism. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some regressive conservative who, with a red face, watched fahrenheit 9/11 and decided to slur Michael Moore because of his fabricated "misrepresentations and untruths." I guess I'm writing this because I had the misfortune of seeing "The Awful Truth," and I feel I need to get this off my chest or it will bore itself into my mind until I have an aneurysm. (If I had an aneurysm, I'd definitely make sure my dead body ends up up the Shamu tank at Sea World. At least I could warp some kids' minds in the process of dying.)  Every episode is literally like, "AWFUL FACT OF THE DAY: Some obscure, skewed study shows that Americans are dumb and like explosions and I'm Michael Moore an attention-starved clownboat!" Seriously, it's interesting Moore critiques "American Indulgence" when he thought having a television show for that kind of pseudo-racist content was alright. - Thus Says the Pellingto 
 If you have already purchased the book "Eat Right 4 Your Type" you won't need this supplement as all the info is right there 
 The authors have not read their own references. On pages 339 thru 341, they describe Colebrook's equation as an expression that has been "fitted to the data." Colebrook describes his equation as "a transition curve that merges asymptotically into the smooth and rough-pipe laws." They describe Moody's friction factor curves as "average values for the data obtained from experiments." Moody describes his curves as plots of Colebrook's equation. His curves are also used to decorate the inside of the book's jacket. Have the authors read any of their references?  Prior to the time that the text CONDUIT FLUID FLOW was published in 2004 by D.May, the subject matter has been devoid of substantive relationships because the nature of fluid friction was not understood. The initial developments by Reynolds, von Karman, Prandtl and Colebrook had not been developed to finality. The state-of-the-art was frozen in time, and this incomplete and incorrect information is what the subject book is comprised of. Coupled with the numerous formulations in calculus that do not go anywhere, the book is not a credible learning tool 
 This book feels presumptuous. That is the only way I can describe it. The writing is hardly worth recommending to anyone, and Savannah is a spoiled brat. How this entire town can be in awe of this girl and her family is beyond me. She does not prove herself in the end at all. This book has gone straight into my resell pile. 
 I think this may be a great product, and is why I bought it. However, mine NEVER worked (and hence was never actually used, it was just taken out of the box!)The remote would beep the collar but not spray. Seller did have manufacturer send new batteries (which further delayed my getting a good response to this situation). New batteries arrived, item still didn't spray, but seller would only refer me to dealing directly with the manufacturer, to get a replacement, even though I responded within their advertised 30 day return policy. Please read seller information and return policies CAREFULLY! Even if you get them to take something back (only if never opened...if opened and doesn't work, they toss you to the manufacturer), there is a 25% RESTOCKING FEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Pretty exorbitant and not Amazon type service I have come to expect over many years of buying from Amazon! Be very careful of sellers that are not Amazon...sometimes it isn't very clear it is not Amazon. My feedback on Seller is on feedback page and seller responded, but I don't get a chance to respond to their feedback, which gives the misconception that I actually used this product! I couldn't have used it as it didn't work! If you want to buy this, I'd recommend a reputable pet store such as Pet Smart where you can easily take an item back if it doesn't work and get a refund. Even if they are willing to replace something, you may not want to risk having future problems with it in a month or two and would want a refund, which most stores have no problem with doing for you. Next time I go the established pet stores 
 I liked the pace, flow ,and language of this novel. My problems stemmed from character behavior, having grown up in Texas I could not relate to these boys. I can not imagine any scenario where a groupsof teenage boys would get together to go have sex witha calf. I'm not naive to think this has never happened, it muight even happen on a regular basis, but not as a group activity with half the high school there to watch. Like ise there is no great homophobic group than teenage boys and for the author to say they made a habit of grabbing for each other's privates came across as unbelievable. Once I can't beleive a books characters, I no longer care about the story.   
 The Body Project provides very selective leeway into the societal effects of African-American adolescent girls and their personal body projects. The main focus of this book is on the evolution of the white middle-class adolescent girl throughout American history. African-American and Jewish girls are mentioned briefly in a few chapters, while other ethnic groups are simply never discussed. Are these other various ethnic groups not worthy of their equal place in Brumberg's book? Brumberg focuses on the evolution of the white middle-class female adolescent starting in the early 1800s and ending in the late 1990s. An evolution of the African American adolescent also took place during these times, but differently than that of their white female counterparts.  In order to understand black American adolescents today, foundation for cultural practices must first be established. Brumberg never mentions the coexistence of enslaved blacks, in America during the 18th or 19th centuries. Though all women have the same biological anatomy, our genes vary, our cultures vary, so we should dispel the idea that when certain groups of women who menstruate earlier than others are abnormal or inferior. Brumberg reveals that this type of thought was well circulated throughout the medical community remained true during the Victorian period. The notion that black health was considered an expendable asset in the American medical community well through the early 1970s.  One major issue that Brumberg avoids is the abuse of children and adolescents. There is probably a close connection between the body projects that adolescents undertake and their harsh self-image.  Brumberg fails to expand on the greater idea that people exist who can never truly choose their identity before it first chooses them. Many girls are intrinsically bound to a stereotype, despite self-image. Possibly everyone has small things that they would like to alter about their physical appearances; however Americans also fail to see these "body projects" as a form a western female mutilation, of which millions of women have fallen victim. Plastic surgery is an ever-growing project that young girls obsess about. This standard idea of beauty that girls manipulate themselves on must disappear, before our individuality as women disappears.  
 I dragged myself through every novel in this series with soap-opera like compulsion, always looking forward to the climatic appearance of our Lord.  Therefore, I anticipated this final novel to be glorious, as the title indicates, but I was woefully wrong.  Are my expectations too lofty for the day of our coming King and His Kingdom?  Certainly not!    I support Christian fiction with many 5 star reviews,--just look at my other reviews--but I can not recommend this series 
 I purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine. Unfortunetly, the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical. I would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment 
 Having read (and thoroughly enjoyed) Levitt's Freakonomics, I picked up "Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life" looking for more of the same. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed.   I get the impression the author intended to write a Freakonomics-type book, but was only able to come up with 40 pages of material (located at the end of the book). Facing an irate publisher, he then filled in the initial 290 pages with his old Economics lecture notes. As a result, readers who have taken an elementary economics course will find much of the material repetitive, while those who have not will most likely find the material too confusing to be of any real use. (Despite the glowing accolades on the cover, the author's explanations are no better than those available in a standard textbook.)  The author also posits end-of-chapter questions for the reader to ruminate upon, but does not provide any answers. Aside from formal textbooks where such questions are intended to be assigned to students, such tactics are unconscionable. Of course, the author may be priming the pump for sales of a "Hidden Order Supplement".  A final negative point is the author's tone, which is frequently condescending towards the reader (e.g. telling the reader they would not understand the math behind a given theory, so it will not even be presented). While this may be true for a layperson reading the book, being talked down to certainly does nothing to build their confidence or cultivate their interest in the subject matter.  Overall, if you can borrow a copy from a friend or a library, the last 40 pages are worth reading. Otherwise, save your time and money.  Reviewer's background: B.Sc. (Computing Science & Mathematics) M.B.A. (Finance & Marketing) Ph.D. (Finance) 
 So ummm...is this about werewolves? Native American shape shifters? Or a pack of ordinary wolves on the loose in NYC?  Damned if I know and damned if the director, screenwriter, cast and crew know either. Wolfen is one of them there horror movies where the true face of terror are Things That Aren't Really Explained Or Make Much Sense.  This can be an effective device in movies, go watch any David Lynch movie to immerse yourself in a sense of mystery and enigma. In Wolfen however, the effect is mostly that of people wandering around doing stuff and saying things and then there is some action at the end and then the movie is over. Maybe they were going for some kind of Kaffkaesque feeling of dread, but this came out a year after Chaddyshack, so frankly I doubt it.  Albert Finney joins the distinguished ranks of obviously foreign actors playing a big city American cop-he does Ah-nuld proud! Gregory Hines plays a guy who jokes a lot, I'm not sure but he might have been a cop too. Edward James Olmos plays a Native American construction worker who smiles a lot and knows more than he is saying, He would play a better version of this character a year later, in Blade Runner.  I'm sure there are some people reading this who are enraged and consider me obtuse and unsophisticated for not picking up on the nuances of the directon and the script. At least, I certainly hope such people exist because maybe one or more of them could track me down and explain to me what the crap is going on here.  I eagerly await your responses!  PS- In case you are wondering, no I haven't read the novel the movie is based on. I suppose I could but Whitley Strieber has said in inerviews that his horror novels are metaphors for his alien abduction experiences, so I most likely won't get help there.. 
 Required text for class. Our class felt this book could have been much better laid out and explained 
 This phone has many features that I really wanted--ability to add addition hands sets, shared phonebook, speakerphone on each handset, 5.8 Ghz DSS.  I didn't find any other phone w/ these features even though, to me, they seem like minimal features in a modern phone.  Anyway, I am really disappointed.  Each feature is poorly executed such that it is really a pretty lousy phone.  The shared phonebook is a nice idea but so hard to access and find the number that its really quicker to dial the number yourself.  The voicequality of the handsets is inferior to every other phone I've used.  The only (sorta) exception is that the handset speakerphone voicequality is even worse.   5.8 DSS is nice, but the range is short (doesn't reach out to my driveway even though my baby monitor works fine in that location).  I recommend that you not buy this phone.  Wait till another company implements this feature set in a better phone 
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
 My bought this for my 3-year old daughter, she played for a few days and got tired of it and went back to her Dora's doll house, which is much much more durable and fun than this. 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 I've given this book two tries---- once with my eyes and once with my ears (iPod). I just can't get through it. Sometimes the starred reviews in SLJ and Booklist completely mystify me-- this is a book that needs some filling in. The characters have the complexity of line drawings. I bet there's a good book here; it just needs a few more drafts.   For example, the protaganist's new friend--- I'm sure there are less believable characters in literature, but I can't think of any at the moment. And the little goofy bits of description--- the father remarks that the boy's school smells like every other school, like chalk. Ok, who here can dredge up the odor of chalk? Have I just missed the odor of chalk all these years working in a school? It all reminds me of narrators who refer dramatically to the smell of blood-- when really that's a remark that only a vampire character is justified in making. Have I been missing the well-known smell of blood all these years, too? Good lord, the smell of chalk. Granted, the father character also says the school smelled of gym socks, and that smell would apply to the locker room. Quibbles, yes. But when the characters are so dull, my mind drifts to the little annoying flaws of language. Whose doesn't?   When I saw Chicken Boy was up for a 2008 Grand Canyon Reader Award, I thought I would just chime in here. Different strokes, I guess--but kids will be bored by this book. Librarians, be ready to contend with the smell of boredom 
 I am torn by this book. While I have read previous academic journal articles and in-depth humanities public magazines about such things as textual variation in the Quran and its theoretical path of evolution (with which I agree), nonetheless, Nevo and Koren take this ball and run onto a whole new playing field. And here, on the issues of secular Byzantine history and eastern church history, the two seem to almost willfully adopt a contentious theory and deliberately reinterpret every bit of archaeological and literary evidence that does not agree with said theory.  So, I give it two stars. Here's why, with some suggested alternative reading at the end of this review. While the Sassanid seizure of Palestine (and Egypt), followed by Byzantine counter-war later, would have left Palestine stripped of Byzantine troops and open to a peaceful non-Muslim monotheist Arab infiltration, some of their speculation here is historically unfounded, and unnecessary. There is no need to presume that the Byzantines had totally withdrawn their forces in the process of establishing Arab foederates circa 500-525, or a century before the Sassanid invasion. And, even to the degree Byzantine troops were withdrawn, this certainly doesn't mean Byzantine interests were withdrawn. To the north and west, over the previous two centuries or more, Eastern, Western and unified Roman Empires had established various Germanic tribal foederates without withdrawing Roman interests in Gaul, Pannonia, etc.  On church history, the authors engage in pure speculation, unsubstantiated by any footnoted research. They claim Byzantine emperors such as Justinian and Justin deliberate fostered heresy in outlying provinces as a way of pushing Palestinians, Egyptians, etc., out of the Byzantine fold and forcing them to survive on their own. Again, the withdrawal of Byzantine troops does not imply withdrawal of Byzantine interests and therefore does not require such a Machiavellian scenario.  Also implausible is their contention that the Byzantine emperors were in reality puppets of the court camarilla. Some may have been puppets of the troops that revolted against a previous emperor to put the on the throne, but that's a different story.  Now, with all those reservations about the book (with a couple still to come), here is the scenario of Nevo and Koren.  The Muslim Arabs never mounted a jihadic Muslim war against the Byzantine empire. First, they moved into a power vacuum. Second, they were not unified until the establishment of the Umayyad caliphate under Muawiya in 661, some 30 years after the death of Muhammed. Third, there was no Islam until Umayyads recognized the need for a state religion and invented one out of extant Arab monotheism. Fourth, there was no Muhammed.  As noted, I believe that item four may be true, from previous reading. You don't need this book to learn that. No. 3 hangs with no. 4, and again can be found elsewhere -- more on this in a second. No 1 may be true, but without the off-the-wall reasoning of Nevo and Koren behind it; arguments from silence at that time, from Christian writers not describing a massive invasion, may be telling. No. 2 -- depends on one's definition of relative degrees of unity, or lack thereof; this is an open book, and one where their rereading of literary evidence from the period and shortly after is most contentious.  Now, back to their points three and four.  They note Muhammed is not named on Arab coins until 690, well after the Umayyads would have started organizing Islam as a state religion in their scenario. Second, when he first became known to Christian writers of that era, it is as a king, not a prophet. (However N/K overlook the possibility that Christian polemicists might have refused to discuss him even as a "so-called prophet." Third, "Muhammed" is only mentioned four times in the Quran, compared to 136 for Moses and 24 for Jesus, but this is countered by the argument that an actual Muhammed would consider it riduculous, or even sacrilege, to compare himself to Moses or Jesus. Fourth, "Muhammed" can be a title, roughly and idiomatically, but not literally, equivalent to Messiah or Christ.  What eventually led to "Islam" being formed, then?  Their conjectured sources are Abrahamism, based on Jewish influence; Judeo-Christianity, more commonly known as Ebionism -- Jews who accepted Jesus as a prophet, or even the Messiah, but as a purely human being Messiah without any Pauline deity overtones; and Christian sects/heresies, i.e. Nestorianism and Monophysitism.  However, N/K don't go far enough. They do not discuss the possible influence of Manicheanism, which still had faint elements in the Middle East at this time, certainly in areas outside Byzantine or Sassanid control. They apparently are unawares of the religion of Mandeanism -- a Jewish-based religion similar to the Ebionites of Judeo-Christianity, except with John (the Baptist) revered as the Messiah, not Jesus. (Read between the lines in Acts about disciples of John knowing "only" the baptism of John and you see the curtain briefly pulled back on proto-Mandean/proto-Christian conflict.  I am not enough of an Islamic scholar to comment on the thoroughness or accuracy of all their research there. I do hold a graduate divinity degree, though, and find much of their speculation, especially emperors' alleged use of heresy to political ends, as being unsubstantiated.  One final etymological note. "Muslim" did not originally mean "one who submits," despite Muslim claims for that. Instead, the s-l-m root of the word is the same as in Salem, Jerusalem in Hebrew, and therefore involves the idea of peace -- communal peace, similar to what Paul calls for in his letters - greeting one another with the (kiss of) peace.  This book has some gems, but they require a lot of digging. Here's a better place to dig: Read the 1998 three-month serial in Atlantic Monthly for an easier to digest, and much more plausible, historical-critical basic overview of the development of Islam 
 I watched as much as I could stand on PBS before concluding this was not a classic 19th century novel unknown to me but a poor recent imitation, and came online to verify that.  Anyone who is enjoying watching this has presumably never seen anything based on a really good novel, like those by Dickens, Dumas, or even Wilkie Collins. What ****!  I refuse to waste my time even to see it through to the end.  This is only for people in the current generation raised to observe frequent violence rather than intelligent plot and conversation.  It is not terrible, but not worth watching if you have anything at all worth doinng with your time 
 As an English Lit. major in college a MLA Handbook is indispensible, but I was disappointed with this one.  I found it difficult to locate the information I needed, often having to comb several pages to find what I was looking for.  It is just not convenient to use.  I much prefer Diana Hacker's "A Writer's Reference."  The layout of her book is much simpler to navigate, and the spiral binding is always a plus, because it lays open on your desk nicely.   
 A big disappointment.After filling with hot water as instructed the water temp cooled off immediately regardless of the "warmer" as advertized.It was too shallow to cover the feet if massage attachments were in place.I returned it for a refund 
   This is bring to your notice that the product that i have orderd has not reached me yet. I request you to do the needful. Thanking you Prince Georg 
 I am utterly disappointed in the direction that Gamepro has taken over the past two years. I actually stopped my subscription for about 1 year, but came back to the 20 issues for $10 at their (10?) year anniversary.  I forget.  But the magazine is really bad.  One thing I laugh is, the retro corner.  They have info about issues from 5 and 10 years before, and they always announce the number of pages from 10 years ago. I think the most recent issue, they said: 140 pages?  Huh?  I think my last issue was around 100.  And don't try to tell me they've lost 40 pages in advertising.   Too bad on-line reviews and websites, are taking over the subscriptions of the hardcopy magazines. I'll stick with hardcopy until the end of my life. Or until the quality of these types of magazines gets so low, I can't stand it anymore.  Or until my subscription runs out on this craptacular effort.   You guys were pretty good 5 years ago, but you've gone to pot these past two years!  I'm talkin' to you Watchdawg!!!  You guys are suckin' lately!!!  MC White said:  You guys are suckin'!! 
 design of book is very poor--pictures totally unclear and print is crowded making it impossible to focus on the story.  The translations are not bad but there is no effort to organize the material and put it in contex 
 Yes my friends, it's time to review yet another one of Roger Corman's Comedy Classics. The 1978 film "Deathsport" arose from two significant incidents. One, the box office success of George Lucas's "Star Wars" virtually ensured that Corman would attempt to capitalize on that film's success. Two, Rog needed product to follow up on his "Death Race 2000" flick. Retaining the services of David Carradine and throwing in sound effects lifted directly from "Star Wars," Corman must have thought "Deathsport" would rake in millions. There's just one problem, however. "Deathsport" is an awful film. It's poorly scripted, cheesily acted, suffers from cheap production sets and lousy props, and generally runs about seventy-five minutes longer than its eighty-two minute runtime requires. I've seen many Roger Corman films thanks to the miracle of DVD technology, and have even enjoyed more than a few of them. For instance, I think "Humanoids From the Deep" is a massively entertaining movie. But "Deathsport" is in a category all its own. It's easily one of Corman's worst efforts. If you're familiar with his particular brand of low-grade sludge, you know that's saying a lot. When he misses, he misses big time. "Deathsport" is a huge miss.  The opening scenes of the film tell us that what we are about to see takes place in the future, 1000 years after an even called the Neutron Wars decimated humanity. Umm, o.k. Why not? It could happen. Then we see Carradine loping through rugged landscape clad in a cloak, a loincloth, and a few stock post-apocalyptic accoutrements. He's Kaz Oshay, a member of a rabidly individualistic sect possessing mental abilities and a tendency to speak dialogue that sounds like it came from a box of fortune cookies called the Range Guides. An evil dude by the name of Ankar Moor (Richard Lynch) sits nearby on a mountaintop, watching our hero through a scope while issuing frantic ambush orders to a bunch of hapless foot soldiers. Moor wants to capture Carradine's character at the behest of the evil Lord Zirpola (David McLean), a tyrant who rules over Helix City, so that the people in the city can watch Oshay die painfully in a spectator called...wait for it...DEATHSPORT! Predictably, Oshay falls into the hands of Moor and soon learns of a plot to wipe out as many Range Guides as possible. He teams up with one of them, Deneer (Claudia Jennings), to bring down the hegemony of Zirpola and Ankar Moor.  Along the way we're treated to one ham-fisted scene after another. Geez, where to start? How about with Ankar Moor's obvious comparisons to Darth Vader. He dresses in black, was once a Range Guide himself, and now works for an evil emperor...I mean Lord. Then there's the Deathsport itself. Set in a huge coliseum surrounded by cheering crowds--it's all created with canned sound effects and large paintings--the actual game is so lame I hesitate to describe it. Contestants drive fearsome death machines that shoot lasers that vaporize their enemies. Sounds great, doesn't it? It is until you realize these "death machines" are simply dirt bikes covered in molded plastic. Moreover, all they do is drive around popping wheelies and jumping over dirt ramps. Oshay and Deneer compete by running around this dirt obstacle course knocking the bad guys off the bikes, which then explode with big blooming fireballs. We even see one of the riders stumbling around on fire in slow motion. The subsequent escape, and thus the rest of the film, consists of endless chase scenes, explosions, and dialogue so dumb it'll lower your IQ score by fifty points. Will Oshay battle Ankar Moor in the end? Who will win? Who cares?  Whew. You'd have to check out "The Shape of Things to Come" or any of the Italian post-apocalyptic actioners to find a movie that compares with the mind-numbing banality of "Deathsport." Every actor associated with this boilerplate ought to have his or her SAG card seized and burned. It's been awhile since I've seen a film fail on so many levels. Ripping off sound effects and plot points from "Star Wars" is only the tip of the iceberg. Witness, for example, the over the top shenanigans from David McLean as Lord Zirpola. The actor who plays the character, David McLean, looks like a low rent Vic Morrow. His performance consists of threatening underlings when he's not clutching his head and roaring in pain from the "radiation poisoning" that's threatening his sanity. Then there is Claudia Jennings's sultry dance in her birthday suit. O.k., I really liked that part, but I couldn't help suppress a chuckle and a groan when I noticed that her dance was part of a torture devised by Lord Zirpola. The method of torture, you ask? Deneer must sashay through a bunch of dangling Christmas lights encased in plastic. When Zirpola flicks a switch, they cause immense pain. At least that's what I gathered from the ominous music and sound effects. Speaking of the music, the score consists of random synth noises slapped together. It's utter garbage.  Extras on the disc consist of trailers for "Big Bad Mama," "The Capitol Conspiracy," "Knocking on Death's Door," and "Death Race 2000." There's also a talk that lasts for roughly five seconds, long enough for David Carradine to punch out an interviewer who has the temerity to mention the word "Deathsport" to him. I'm kidding. There is no interview, but one could imagine such an incident occurring since the film is so incredibly awful. Still, I'm going to give the movie two stars because of the lovely Jennings and because I can't get enough of these terrible post-apocalyptic flicks. Avoid "Deathsport" like the plague unless you have similar interests.  
 As a personal reflection, memoir, this book can be mildly entertaining. However if you like I were waiting for some guidelines about forging a way to a more intelligent dialogue that goes beyond the partisan mud-slinging, that passes as "meaningful political discussion" these days, I and probably you will be disappointed. I felt there were two chapters that hinted at what these guidelines might be, and then there was a great deal of what the author complains about in others-"psychobable". As a pure memoir, if this book were described as such, I would had added a star, but if you read the prologue, and perhaps two chapters...the rest is a recycled idea that is never in my opinion flushed out fully. Too bad for the book starts out very promisin 
 I really wanted THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES because I thought that the story of the Mothman would be fascinating reading, a really intriguing narrative of the sightings of the tall, grayish man with wings and red eyes who could take off in flight straight up off the ground, an interesting examination of the myth and the legend. There is something to me very frightening about this type of legend, and I was eager to read the exploration of sightings around Point Pleasant, Va., in 1966 and 1967 before the Silver Bridge collapsed and nearly 40 area residents died in the tragedy. What a great tale could be told, I thought...  I am still waiting. This book is not well structured or told. It seems to be the dumping ground of every otherwordly event Keel has ever seen or heard of. There is little narrative arc here or suspense. Keel has the mistaken notion that loading the book with every bizarre occurence he's ever been told or witnessed gives him credibility, but it is actually the opposite. He and his "colleagues" saw so many UFOs and strange lights in the sky in West Virginia (and other places across the country) in the late 1960s, that one simply cannot believe that there isn't more corroboration of these sightings.   Keel does say that he doesn't believe in beings from other planets, but rather beings from a dimension outside of our own who like to make trouble for us, find things out about us, and sometimes warn us of things that are going to happen. Because of their inexperience with earth time, they often use out of date slang and drive old cars that are in mint condition and still smell new. For some unexplained reason, the "people" from this other dimension seem always to wear thick-soled shoes.   Keel as a true believer is a poor writer of a convincing book, as he often justifies a witnesses credibility by saying that they are respectable people, or some such qualifier. He anticipates, then, no need the reader might have to be convinced that thousands of sightings of UFOs and Mothman may need some evidentiary backup. This lack of the writer's disbelief and proof, the lack of any plot or arc and the muddled content of the book make this work a solid disappointment. Someone needs to let me know if the book that can be written about this ever is written 
 This book should be entitled "The Obsessive-compulsive's Guide to Keeping House".  The lists of tasks to do daily, weekly and monthly were more than a little overwhelming. If you did all the things this book says you need to do to keep a clean, orderly home then you will have little time for anything else.  There are some good ideas in here, but they are overshadowed by the to-do checklists.  Also the pictures in this book are of rooms with a very sterile, minimalist look to them.  Boring.  The rooms are indeed clutter free and spotlessly clean, but lack character and warmth.  A little like living in a hospital. I was very disappointed with this book 
 I was looking for a book to guide me in postponing or avoiding hip replacement surgery.  The title "The Active Person's Guide to Taking Charge"  prompted me to buy this book, but I was disappointed in the book because so little of it was devoted to really taking charge of your physical situation so that you can strengthen your hip and achieve its maximum flexability.  A better choice for those wishing to do everything in their power to avoid or postone surgery would be Dr. Klapper's book, "Heal Your Hips", which is also available from Amazon.co 
 Inside Outside Upside Down was a very cute book. This story really has no moral; it's just a cute book to read. It talks about how the boy bear cub goes into a box and gets turned upside down on a truck and drives into town and comes back the very same way. I wouldn't recommend this book to any child if you are looking for something educational, it's just a fun book to read over and over again. But I would recommend it just for fun 
 The beats are weak, the lyrics are weak. DJ Babu is alright on this album. I only liked the song with Evidence 
 Certainly a nice looking book.  From what I understand, Marvels launched the careers of its two principle creators, and it's definitely not a bad place to start.  Alex Ross's work is nothing short of spectacular.  His art is the closest comics will ever come to fine art, and demands respect.  However, I cannot give this book a glowing review because it failed on a very base level.  It failed to pull me into the Marvel Universe.  Sounds odd, I know.  But as a man in my early twenties with little to no understanding (or appreciation) of the Marvel Universe, I'm left in the dark.  I could easily understand why an older man, or a Marvel Comic enthusiast, would love this comic, but as a newcomer, I was left behind.  There is a very fine difference between inventing a concept, and perfecting it.  Marvels serves as the prototype for future masterpiece Kingdom Come, which also featured an everyman POV.  Naturally, there's a frustration on my part that comic creators often make allusions or other nostalgic call-backs to the Silver Age of comics.  This is problematic for comic readers who, like myself, have no intimate knowledge of that bygone era.  And from what I've read of it, there's not a lot that impresses me.  Do not buy this book unless you are very much aware of Marvel's content history.  Otherwise, you'll be left scratching your head.  (God only knows what was happening during that Galactus bout. 
 I couldn't believe that I bought this crap. I didn't learn anything from this book. It has so little content. Most of the book is an appendix listing the stocks on the Nasdaq. This is most likely an attempt to make money from the day trading craze. I bought this because of the last few glowing recommendations but  they must have been paid to write it. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. There are better ones out there that provides better details on day trading 
 I find it impossible to trust any would-be interpreter of Jane Austen who, in her analysis of Pride & Prejudice, writes the line: "Her [Mrs. Bennet's] restored faith that Lydia and Wickham will turn out very well is wonderfully brought to pass".   This is easily my least favorite among the seven or so biographies that I have read; I was particularly disappointed after marvelous beginning that Tomalin made in describing Jane's birth and earliest life.   I made myself read it a second time in order to be fair.   I am left with the feeling that while Tomalin genuinely admires Jane Austen, she has considerably more pity for her life than sympathy for her point of view.   Ms. Tomalin places a great emphasis on the importance of passion and enthusiasm that I doubt Austen so uncritically shared.  Indeed, Ms. Tomalin has to interchange JA's heroes and villains in order to come up with interpretations of the book that please her, and in several cases, insist that JA got things wrong in her epilogues.   This leads to some odd juxtapositions that fit right in with Tomalin's somewhat overwrought thinking.  Tomalin cannot accept that Marianne could move on and love Colonel Brandon, but she is also upset that Cassandra Austen spent the rest of her life mourning her dead fiance.  Isn't perpetual mourning for a lost love be what Tomalin would have Marianne doing, given that Willoughby married someone else?  Consistently inconsistent, Tomalin lambastes Fanny Price for declining to marry someone that she doesn't love (or like or trust), at least while there her true love remains available.  Tomalin is apparently one of those who feel that it is not enough of an achievement for Austen to be one of the very few authors who, after two hundred years, remain both critical and popular successes.  No, she wants to convert JA to a heroine suitable for the late 20th century.  This is particularly ironic since she faults the Victorians for their attempts to remake JA in their own image.  She attempts, failing dismally in my case, to convince us that JA had an eventful life.  She turns to posthumous psychoanalysis for this, interpreting eventful as traumatic and finding psychic wounds from the Austens' childrearing techniques.  The book rapidly takes on a whiny quality that I found tedious and annoying.  I comment on this being 52, having been born in 1953.  As such, I can remember when "experts had proven" that the child is born a blank slate through the present day when parents are held to have little effect on their children's psychological development except for the responsibility to keep them alive and healthy.  I am also well aware that "expert" child-rearing advice has changed over the centuries, some eras recommend techniques that in other eras were considered certain to produce psychopaths.  (readers might want to read Sarah Hrdy's Mother Nature or Stephen Pinker's The Blank Slate).   While my own tastes in childrearing certainly would align more with Tomalin's, I find it foolish and irritating for her to excoriate Mrs. Austen for raising their children according to the accepted pattern of their day.   (And for all that Tomalin may bring in feminist interpretation, she is clearly engaging in mother-blaming here: all decisions that she doesn't like are charged to Mrs. Austen.) While her arguments of how this affected JA may seem logical, does it make sense when considering that so many other people of the time shared similar experiences?   The reader may want to read Elizabeth Jenkin's arguments in her 1938 book that Jane Austen was in fact writing through most of her "years of silence", as well as David Nokes arguments in his 1997 biography that Jane was having too good a time to write as much, before accepting Tomalin's explanation of Jane as falling into a severe depression after a repetition of childhood trauma.   I think in her efforts to make JA into a martyr, Tomalin slights her as a social critic.  She also fails to fully appreciate the problems of dependent daughters in interlocked families, the tension between wanting and needing family unity and the desire for personal autonomy.   I have no doubt that JA keenly felt and resented the disadvantages imposed upon her as a younger unmarried daughter, but this is not a unique problem imposed by her particular family.  The conventions of the time meant that Jane and Cassandra really were financial drains on their family: their society had failed to make any accomodation to the realities of making women financially dependent but expecting companiate marriages.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the popularity of JA derives from her attention to this double-bind that so many of her female readers shared.    Tomalin sees the effect only on Jane, not on her other family members.  I can sympathize with JA's distress at leaving Steventon, but surely her 72-year old father was entitled to retire?  Her parents spent decades in Hampshire whether they liked it or not because that is where Rev. George Austen's living was - didn't they have as much right to live somewhere else for a change as Jane had stay where she was? Tomalin faults James for not offering his sisters a home independent of his mother; I presume that Jane could have asserted her wishes on the basis of he offer to house all three women, but, independent of Jane's dislike for James' wife Mary, how practical would that have been?  If Jane has lived with James, would Cassandra have been with her or with their mother?  At that time, given their resources, it may have been impossible for Mrs. Austen and her daughters to independently pursue the course that each preferred.   Several solutions suggest themselves, but they all involve Mrs. Austen living as a dependent relation or the brothers Austen coming up with a lot more money.  Tomalin also by this makes JA something of a hothouse flower.  Tomalin makes a point of mentioning servants, but in a somewhat contradictory fashion is arguing that Jane's family should have understood her genius and supported her in the leisured style to which she was somewhat, and would have like to have been even more accustomed.   I would have liked that myself.  How many people have the luxury of choosing quiet or excitement and work or leisure just as they choose?   If JA had lived today, would she have been able to write it she had also been required to earn her own living?  Tomalin has done some wonderful research on peripheral matters such as Austen's neighbors that anyone who is very interested in Austen or her period should find very interesting.  Indeed, has this been written as a book on the associates of the Austens, I would probably have given it 5-stars as long as Tomalin left out her psychologizing.  This includes much more about Jane's cousin and sister-in-law Eliza Hancock than is warranted by her importance in the author's life.  It is very interesting, and I am happy to read it, but it does remain that the real biographical information on JA herself is somewhat scanty compared to other biographies of this length.  I would not recommend this as either a first or only biography.  My own recommendations for biographies so far are Carol Shields (short), Valerie Grosvenor Myers' Obstinate Heart (moderate length, seriously flawed by a lack of notes), and John Halperin (long).  Elizabeth Jenkins' is considered a classic biography, but it can be difficult to get and doesn't strike me as worth the trouble given the other material now available.  The notes are beautifully done so that it is easy to match the note with the citation in the text.  There are also useful family trees and a map of the Hampshire neighborhood of the Austens.  I cannot begin to guess what the logic for arranging the bibliography was 
 It still amazes me that anyone takes Gould seriously. He is an admitted Marxist, and he allows his social beliefs to influence science. That is not science. Science is a dispasionate search for the truth. I get the feeling reading this book that Gould doesn't like what the truth is, so he wants to shape the way we see the truth. They used to do that in the middle ages when it started to look like the earth revolved around the sun.  Gould tries to claim that Samuel George Morton fudged his data on measuring skull sizes. This is not true. Morton conducted his tests with integrity, and only one error was found which actually benefited the measurements of a non-Caucasian group (Kevin McDonald, "Culture of Critique", 36). General intelligence is not a "statistical artifact" as Gould wants to promote.  Gould or any other scientist who wants to take Darwin out of biological sciences should be viewed with extreme skepticism 
 I'll try to start with something positive: the cover is pretty.  Beyond that, I'm not going to put more time into my review than the author spent "writing" this book which means I've got 5 minutes or less. This is a collection of newspaper columns. If the author wrote 10 columns on the same topic and included them all in the book, he didn't even bother to edit out the redundancies. Columns that span 20 pages in the book could have been reduced to 4 by eliminating the 80% of each column that he spent repeating the previous day's columns. Couple that with columns that spend 10-20 pages arguing against a particular injustice, only to see in a 1 paragraph note at the end that the injustice was indeed righted, or that the column is 5 years out of date and no longer relevant with events that have transpired since, and one gets the sense of a writer with little respect for his readers and their time. Done. In under 5 minutes. 
 I was so disappointed by this book. There are a lot of pretty pictures but hardly any actual craft projects. It's more of a display of the author's and her mother's private Christmas decoration collection. The book gave me one or two ideas but all in all was not worth the money. I regret buying this book 
 The book THE LOST CONTINENT is an amazing captivating read.  Bryson is truly brilliant in his descriptions.  This CD totally KILLS that.  First of all the narrator reads at a mile a minute, sometimes to the point where you can't understand him.  And second, they abridged the CRAP out of it, cutting some of the most interesting commentary and actually cutting the entire SECOND HALF of the book!  While the book is amazing, this particular recording of it should be avoided at all costs 
 I thought this book would be more autobiographical and less of his personal opinions about life.   I got bored after only a few chapters and skimmed the 2nd half of the book.  Unfortunately, SP is not a good writer and it SHOWS.  The book skips from one time period to the next and back again without much rhyme or reason to it.  I am a big fan of his acting and this was a real disappointment.   Don't bother with this one.  
 Authors note: For some reason I rated this album a 2 out of 5 stars, although I thought I had rated a bit higher, and since I can't change that "star-rating" now, I will say this:  This album is good, borderline great at times, and shows at a lot of promise. It's hyper and rough around the edges, but a lot of fun. It contains a handful good songs, and few great ones, here are a few of the standouts:  "Bicycle, Bicycle, You Are My Bicycle", and "Adventure", are both good...Although I feel that "We Will Vacation, You Can Be My Parasol" is a better song, and had they played around with it a bit more in the studio, it could have "the single", but it's a great song either way.  The next portion I would like to direct to members BYOP:  Whatever muse you guys followed to come up with "October, First Account", keep following it, and if need be, hold it hostage at gunpoint. That song is "the single" of the entire album, and if you can recapture that same mojo a bit more on the next album, the skies the limit.  
 Hanson is an author with a tale to tell and history becomes his puppet.  By focusing on a narrow aspect of ancient life in Greece, he is able to shape history to conform to his views on contemporary society.  Delbruck had years ago provided new insights into ancient warfare.  Hanson uses this approach in perfunctory manner but his conclusions are questionable.  One is left with the ugly feeling that the conclusion led his research and that ultimately, the material is guided by Hanson's preconceptions.  It is testament to the lack of rigor in the field that a book like this is published.  Testament as well to foolish amateur historians like myself who would think there is something here of value.  It is ironic that my review has attracted significantly more attention than other more positive reviews.  Apparently it is easier to attack criticism of the work than it is to praise the work itself 
 "Tribulation Force" is not as good as the first book in the "Left Behind" series.  The authors seem to be doing so much maneuvering to get their characters into the right crucial positions around the Antichrist, that there's almost no time left for the story.   I was amused by the authors' description of the Two Witnesses and their miraculous protection by God.  If God could do that sort of miracle, why hasn't he been doing it all along?  A few incidents of such miraculous protection of missionaries would have sufficed to convert millions in countries like China and Japan, not to mention unbelievers in the U.S. Instead, missionaries sent to non-Christian nations have routinely been killed or expelled.  Why would God permit such a thing?  Does He want people to go to Hell?  Rabbi Ben-Judah's speech in "Tribulation Force" about how he's changed his mind and decided that Christ is in fact the Messiah struck me as absurd.  The Bible prophecy that "a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son" does not even appear in the original Hebrew of the Old Testament. The Hebrew word translated as "virgin" would be more correctly translated into English as "young woman."  "Virgin" is nothing more than an ancient mistranslation that has been copied and recopied over the centuries.  As for the rest of the 109 prophecies that the Rabbi claims were fulfilled by Christ, to say that Jesus Christ is the only person who could fulfill them is silly. Most of the Biblical prophecies of the Messiah are vague; with many, it's hard to say whether they even deal with the Messiah or not.  The Book of Isaiah has many of these prophecies, and it can be mighty obscure.  As we have very little solid evidence for Jesus' actual life history, it's very difficult to know if he actually fulfilled any prophecies. Certainly his followers wanted to think he did, and accounts written by his followers are the only ones we have.  The power of wishful thinking is often underestimated, in my opinion.    The "Left Behind" series takes prophecy in general much too seriously.  The Book of Revelations is essentially a collection of predictions, mostly of disasters, worded in highly symbolic language. This is the same trick that Nostradamus used in his prophecies. Since the language is so symbolic, the predictions can be applied to nearly anything. Wait long enough and bad things are, of course, sure to happen. Vague disaster predictions therefore tend to come true all the time. Since the day Revelations was written, people have popped up constantly claiming that now, at last, the predicted events are all happening, and Christ's kingdom is at hand. Is the Rapture coming this time? I don't think so. Are we likely to have some bad times ahead? Yes, but not because God planned it that way. It is humans who are now causing the biggest disasters.  As an atheist, I find the fundamentalist brand of Christianity, which loves to focus on the Rapture, even less appealing than the more ordinary kind. Fundamentalists seem to assume that "God will provide" and that we don't need to think about humanity's future.   If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.   If you are inclined to believe in the Rapture, I beg you to at least consider some contrary viewpoints. Christ said He would come as a thief in the night. Consider the possibility that He might not come for 500 more years, or 1000. Remember the parable of the talents. Do you want to face Him having ruined the planet He gave us to live on? As far as other fiction, I would suggest Heinlein's book "Job: A Comedy of Justice," which takes belief in the Rapture to its logical conclusion.  
 Like everybody else, I bought this not because I wanted it, but because it was the class text and thus, required.  In that sense, it did its job (and the instructor's) in that it conveyed the information needed to pass the exams.  The downside: --Numerous typo's, especially in the practice problems, leaving you to wonder why your answer doesn't jibe with the book's.  Frustrating.  --SEVERAL leaps in logic:  The book will (loosely) explain a concept.  Then it will give an equation with no explanation as to how it was derived from the original concept.  Sure, you can just memorize the equation, but without understanding WHY it works, it's awful hard to apply it to the real world.  VERY frustrating.  --Many concepts are glossed over.  Not too useful to those making a career of this.  I suppose this book is somewhat useful for a refresher course in geometry and basic surveying math, but it's no value.  Get it only if you have to.  And get it used 
 Rather than give another general review as others have kindly done,  my review focuses on one aspect of the film, indeed one character, that of Martha.   Martha Dunstock is known throughout the film as Martha Dumptruck. Even the film credits include the nickname `Dumptruck' besides the character's surname (evidently feeling the need to labour the point). Portrayed as unattractive and pathetically grateful for any attention she is given, she unwittingly provides the Slater character with information enabling him to murder a student. Later, when the cult status of the `suicides' (that is, murdered students) becomes apparent, Martha attempts her own suicide by walking into the path of traffic. But her attempt is shown as a failure. At the end of the film Martha is bruised and now disabled, in an electric wheelchair. Ryder's character, having finished her voyage of self-realisation, rejects the school Prom night and instead invites Martha to stay in with a video and popcorn. Martha gratefully accepts and the closing scenes show Ryder walking along the corridor while Martha encircles her like a planet around the sun.  The image of Martha in her wheelchair, an object of pity for Ryder and for the audience, signifies to us fears of being different, of not being beautiful, of not being loved and respected. Martha is the person we are all frightened of becoming. She is given no means of solving her predicament by the film maker. And though some of us in the audience may be fat, or disabled, or both, we may yet still fear Martha, and are invited to consider Ryder's protagonist's journey of self discovery as our own, even is in physical and social reality, we are more like Martha.  For this reason, `Heathers' fails as an exploration of the `Hell' of High School ( a description often used by Buffy/Angel/ Firefly's Joss Whedon). Those in the audience NOT as thin and complying with Western standards of `beauty' as the protagonists (probably the majority of us) ultimately may find the so-called subversion of cruel hierarchy in this film just that little too shallow, leaving a bitter after-taste. The way `fat' people are portrayed in films such as these unfortunately often reflect the predictable, transparent and absurd fixations of the film makers. Sadly this is happening even today - in some ways it has gotten even worse since the Western World decided to wage a 'war on fat' (to quote Paul Campos) - and even at best it is lazy film-making. 
 Unfortunately,comes with electronic format only. What happen to people doesn't had any computer with printer ? What I'm going to do when i need information regarding the navigator on my road trip ?

Got almost everything incluing a 3 months free trail of FM triffic message. Garmin should incluing a owner's manual BOOKLET in this high end price gps 
 A nice book for the uninitiate, boring for anyone else. This is a very,very basic book on military hand to hand combat which reads more like a Readers Digest article than a true handbook. The martial arts heritage spiced with some photos of military units training in hand to hand combat and some big size drawings of basic strikes, throws and some disarming moves taken from military manuals and martial arts books makes up most of the content. If this would truly be the "Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat" than give God that our Green Berets never run out of Ammo. If you want something for real life buy the Krav Maga book 
 This book is supposed to be a guide for young people. Any parent should think twice before using it 
 i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
 Very hard to put together, drawers came broken both times- cute though- not at all sturd 
 I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.  This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.  LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).  THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.  THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.  THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.  THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).  The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked. 
 This is a difficult book to evaluate. Its author is obviously a bright scholar, and the book itself comes from an invited memorial lecture at the Seabury-Western Theological Seminary in 1989. There is lots of good material here about 2nd Century Christian beliefs, and quotations from many sources that can be hard to track down.  BUT, it is difficult to know what the author is up to. There is no apparent structure nor theme. He seems to jump from one topic to another with no segue. Each pericope is perfectly good by itself, but there is no cumulative effect. Even more problematic, the documentation is poor and the bibliography is incomplete.  This book may have made a very good lecture, but it doesn't survive as a meaningful book. Nonetheless the material herein is very valuable and the book may be of interest to scholars of early Christianity who are interested in the works of Marcion, Valentinus, Ignatius, Irenaeus, etc. 
 I have put this film off for years for no particular reason,just didn't get around to watching it until recently. I had heard plenty of good things about it & had definitely planned on buying it at some point because of all the positive reviews I'd read. I am so glad I got to catch it the other night on the IFC channel because it is truly one of the most overrated horror films ever made! Not the worst ever made but nowhere near as good as people have made it out to be. There are some good effective scenes,I do particularly think Dee Snyder did a pretty decent job as a twisted lost soul addicted to pain,torture & his love affair with death,ranting & raving about society while he plays with his victims but there still wasn't enough of that good creepy stuff to cover up how illogical the whole story was. It seemed very rushed & unfinished wich intern provides a ridiculous amount of plot holes. Most of the acting was alright but the lead Detective & his annoying partner were aweful(no grip what so ever on ther character's). In the end "STRANGELAND" felt like it was a bad rushed sequel to a better movie. This film is made out to be so much better than it is,a perfect example of how low the standards were for what passed as a good horror film in the 1990's compared to now! 
 Yayo needs to stick to being a criminal...but then again he wasn't even good at that 
 This is not a book about art, but an analytical philosophy of History. For those familiar with Danto's art criticism, the one star should warn you that art criticism will not be found here. For those curious to read this book for its analytical philosophy, you have a four-star endorsement 
 I have always been excited by the prospect of The Beau Brummels. I'd dove into 60's garage rock hoping to find that elusive, "hidden" classic. However, as much as I would seek out The Music Machine, Count Five or The Human Beinz, all I would find was one good song, and a bunch of lame covers.  The Beau Brummels sounded like the exception. I loved the hits, and had forgotten about them until stumbling onto allmusic.com's reviews of Triangle. After cross-checking the album on Amazon, all I heard was that every song was beautiful, eerie.   Alas, now 40 years later, in retrospect, the Brummels still fall short of the hype. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the Triangle album. It's just not the most beautiful, most progressive folk-country-lyrical album I've never heard.   I bought this CD fully expecting to be wowed. I wasn't. First of all, the vibrato singing of Sal Valentino will get to you after a couple of songs, and you'll have to turn it off. It's so extreme, at times he seems to be off key, missing notes. That's okay. I like Yoko Ono, too. I just don't think she's the greatest undiscovered artist of the 20th century.  As a total listen, it takes until the 6th song of the album, Nine Pound Hammer, to catch my interest. It's a nice melody, as is Magic Hollow, and I love the imagery of "Old Kentucky Home". The Flying Burrito Brothers dove into truck driving songs, Merle Haggard and converted some R&B songs nicely as a foray into country music. Home is a pastiche of spousal abuse, parental abuse and sheer alcoholism. I applaud their dark sense of humor.  However, as a purchase, Triangle does not warm my thoughts as a good investment. Once I get this thing out of my car, I imagine a time 7 years from now I'll find the CD again, and wonder whatever inspired me in the first place.  Don't get me wrong. It's worth a listen. I just don't think it warrants the gushings found here.  
 Thirteen year olds can be easily impressed by cheap tricks, "heartfelt" lyrics, and a lot of pretty lights. So it goes with some reviewers of this movie. This movie contains the unending internal reflections of about 6 or 7 different characters. These reflections never really go anywhere, never draw substantive conclusions. Primarily, there is just a lot of whining. THe only exception is the Sean Penn character until the end, when he whines at least as much as everybody else. "War is tough" is one of the main themes of this movie. Is that really a revelation?   One thing you learn early on in acting or directing classes is to "play opposites," meaning put contrasting things in juxtaposition so that the contrast highlights both sides. An example is when a very evil character such as Richard III uses humor. "I'll have her - but not for long." THe fact that the guy is joking about killing his new bride makes him all the more evil to us. At the same time, perhaps we can't avoid laughing in spite of ourselves.  OK, so this director had some of the same classes I did, but he has to use the technique over and over and over and over and over and ... until it starts seeming boring and banal. War scene, lots of dying. Oh look, a pretty butterfly! More blood and bullets. Oh gee, the light going through that leaf is beautiful! Use this trick once or twice and maybe it seems new to the uninitiated audience. Use it more than three times and you are asking for trouble. This director must use it 10-15 times. He turns it into a cliche. When the audience can predict when they are about to see the next opposite, you have overdone it.  So what do we have so far? A bunch of whining character crying about war being bad and a bunch of contrast scenes. And really, that's pretty much it. The movie could have been cut in half with no loss because if there is one thing this movie is, It Is Redundant. It is spoon-feeding you the same message over and over and over again. Ouch, war hurts! Ew, mutilated bodies are yucky. Oh gosh, a little bird got hurt!!! We are so nasty! We must stop this war!!! (never mind the fact that thousands of little birds get eaten alive by cats every day)  The director focuses on the yucky and inconvenient aspects of war - which I suppose would be briliant, except I think almost everybody on the planet already knows that wars are yucky and inconvenient. It's almost as if the author doesn't Believe we know, that he somehow thinks we missed it. And if only he reminds us at every possible repetitive opportunity, again and again and again, well, then maybe we will "get it" and start opposing wars, I guess. Never mind about Hitler and the 6 million jews. Never mind about Pearl Harbor. War is a yucky thing done by bad men, or nice whimpy men trapped in a situation by bad men. It has no meaning and there is nothing remotely noble about it. We were just wasting our time fighting the Nazis. The Nazis were just misunderstood! If they want to cook 6 million jews in the ovens, let them do it.  An adult movie deals with realties and poses questions like, "how do I get myself to do something that I don't want to do, but that I know I should?" Making yourself do things that are not pleasant is one of the hallmarks of reaching adulthood. This movie takes a very adolescent perspective and asks, "if I whine enough, can I get out of my chores?"   The dumbest scene in this movie is when the Jim Caveziel character is surrounded by Japanese and for no reason whatsoever, will not surrender. He stands there in the middle of about 40 Japanese soldiers and decides (after looking at some pretty leaves and butterlies) to raise his weapon so they will shoot him. The funny thing is, it's completely unnecessary: his comrades have already been warned. His death accomplishes nothing but relief for the audience - he can no longer utter his inane internal monologues.   I think if you are a left-winger or have a thing for looking at the bodies of naked boys, you will love this movie. It's the kind of propaganda piece that a vacant, unquestioning mind will eat up. If your leanings are more adult, however, you may hate it. You'll wonder why the story is so one-sided, why nobody seems to believe in the causes they are fighting for, even though the Japanese did attack us, and the Germans did some naughty things too. None of that seems to matter to the storyteller. "Why can't we all get along?" he cries, as the germans load another group of jews into the ovens and turn up the heat...  A final note: if you want to see two really good war movies that make valid criticisms of the "war spirit" and how wars are conducted, see "Gallipoli" and/or "Breaker Morant." These movies are extremely effective in making their points without using cartoonish characters. The characters are real and the plots move the story foreward.  "The Thin Red Line" is what I would call "professed brilliance." A couple of simple tricks are used to try to impress the audience. But there is no real meat here. It's just a bunch of pointless whining. The poetry is poorly written and pretentious. And the characters are not real.   
 This movie is very difficult to watch after awhile. Its about a psycho boss but its not funny at all. I didn't laugh through any of the movie. I love dark comedies like election, heathers, to die for, etc but this just didn't work for me. I hated it so much I returned it (lied and said it was a gift). Don't even rent it horrendous 
 This is the worst ripoff of a major literary work I have ever seen. It takes colossal gall (to say nothing of immense bad taste) to take the bare bones of a Dostoevsky novella & tack on every possible bodice-ripper cliche in movies & then try to interweave Dostoevsky's own personal travails as narrative interstices. All done with no flair for nor flavor of the original.   The acting is strictly mid-20th century nyah-ha-ha Masterpiece Theater while the casting is about as suitable as Ray Winstone in his infamous Henry VIII turn.  I got this just to see the great Luise Rainer. Now I will dispatch this disk to the dustbin where it will surely be outclassed 
 Layard gives a superficial overview of some economic and psycological research. He uses this research to advocate governmental management of happiness, which is the primary theme of the book. Whether or not you agree with that idea, this book's flawed logic and rambiling prose is unilkley to convince anyone either way.   Layard proposes several policies intended to increase happiness including prohibition of vice, increased taxation, redistribution of wealth, and general intervention in the economy. Naturally, his authoritarian proposals for collective happiness largley ignore individual rights and freedom. They also ignore the fact that similar policies have failed when attempted by governments throughout history.   What is clear is that if the department of happiness comes to be, the central planner's idea of happiness won't be mine, and it won't be yours either. 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 I think that Jessica Simpson is trying too hard to be like Britney Spears and Madonna. Truth is, she's no where NEAR Britney/Madonna status! Yes Jess does sing better than both Brit & Madonna combined together but I think that she needs to make something a little more original! The only album that I enjoy from Jess is Irressistable and the remix album. Other than that she totally sucks at making music. Half these songs are not original and it's pretty obvious that she has no talent at writing songs. If this album had a any orginality and showcases her voice on songs that are fit for her, then maybe I would've given it more starts. But for now, I suggest you skip this album and go buy Danity Kane or Christina Aguilera. And if you only wanna buy it cuz it's Jessica Simpson then download it! You'll hate yourself if you buy it 
 James Randi haphazardly lumps parasychology, mythology and various religious subjects together only to dismiss them with a snide comment.  The book is also full of factual inaccuracies.  An example is Abracadabra, which he refers to as the supreme god of the Assyrians (when actually the supreme Assyrian god was Ashur).  In short, don't bother 
 Ships incorrect items.  Product recieved does not match Product Site Description listed on Amazon.com   
 This book was just ok.  I found it to be a bit boring. Not a very good moral to the story, the children just do the same thing back to their parents so what did they learn 
 The best thing I can say about the test is it took 13 days to receive my results.  The actual results varied greatly from those I received from my doctor 3 months prior:  (...)  Both tests were taken following a 12-hour fast.  All instructions were followed.  I find it hard to believe my cholesterol levels changed so drastically in 3 months.  I contacted BioSafe customer service.   All representatives were busy on my first call so I left a message, which was not returned.  I called again and was able to speak to someone right away.  The customer service person was very pleasant and took a lot of time explaining how accurate their tests were and how results from different testing methods (finger prick vs. blood drawn from arm) will vary "slightly".   (...)  I question the accuracy of the biosafe results.      
 I tried to like this CD but Mr Tyrell just doesn't make it work.  He lacks the style/charisma of an icon like Frank Sinatra. The songs come across as lackluster 
  Psychiatry has always mentioned the brain and its parts. They use technical terms in reference to actual parts of the brain. However thier knowledge of mental illness is purely subjective. Meaning they only speculate as a group or panel then "diagnose" the illness by only labeling. Its strange but true. This is how they do it.   The fact that mental illness has no biological proof is the painful truth about psychiatry.  
 This book, and the IFG group in general, do not offer an alternative to capitalist globalisation, which is the real problem, not solely globalisation.  While subsidiarity, or localisation, is an important concept that should be considered and implented in any alternative to capitalism, this book misses the point that capitalism is the problem.    This book operates on the outmoded and illusionary idea that Adam Smith's capitalism, local capitalism, can be achieved and will provide an opporunity for fairness and equality.  Capitalism can never be this way, as it is by nature expansive and anti-local.  This book leaves out the perspectives of many concerned social actors such as Indigenous people and women.  It provides the view of a very narrow selection of the anti-globalisation movement.  This book is dangerous and subversive in that it appears to offer a viable alternative to the exploitation of the current economic world order, and so activists will work toward this reform of capitalism, and in the end prolong suffering and exploitation. The only way is to end capitalism and explore alternatives that are noncapitalist(and perhaps anti-globalisation as well) in nature.  SMASH CAPITALISM 
 It's a disgrace they charge money for this DVD. Producer and actors should be ashamed this is sold.  Fine if people want to experiment with filmmaking, but to release this film with big name actors and charge consumer, unforgivable.  I prefer to have rated this with no stars 
 The first two or three tracks are good but the supporting instrumentals and vocals are poor.  The supporting instrumental on track 6 was so bad I thought the cd had a defect.  In other places, the supporting music is  barely audible.  The only singing occurs on track 12.  I would recommend  getting the cd "Picture This".  It's much better 
 Castillo tells a great story, even if there isn't much truth to it. Yes, all guerilla groups inevitably get involved with drugs. That's about where the truth ends. John Kerry's investigation went nowhere because there was no evidence, and he admitted that. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Dept. also came up empty. So naturally it MUST be a dark conspiracy! Please. The contra leaders were adamant that their subordinates NOT raise money via illegal means. Besides, if the Contras HAD all of that drug money, they wouldn't have needed so much US funding. The cartels ended their association with contra armies by 1982. Bottom line: Castillo's book is not about drugs; it's a shameful attempt to rewrite history in favor of America's red enemies 
 This live album is well recorded, and the band is the best its ever been. Why only 2 stars? The tracklist! Apart from Can I Play With Madnes (yay!) and Lord of the Flies (yawn), its exactly the same as Rock in Rio, released a couple of years ago, with Dance of Death  instead of Brave New World songs.  Why not play Somewhere In Time, or Wasted Years? Or Futureal (ok Blaze song but still)? or Powerslave? All would have fitted into the theme of the concert well. I don't need to see another version of Hallowed Be Thy Name. Or Wrathchild. Or Fear of the Dark. Or Run to the Hills. Good performance (as expected), but VERY disappointing tracklist 
 First T5 lasted 6 months, then just refused to start - was replaced under warranty. This one locked up after about 3 months - was replaced again under warranty. The third T5 lasted about 5 months. It's now out of warranty and won't start or reset. No - I'm not rough on my PDAs. None of them got even as much as a scratch. Each one looked like new when it "broke". The first 2 times, Palm told me the ROM had failed. I guess it's the same problem again, but I'm not spending $169 to get it swapped for another faulty T5. Good bye Palm.  Out of the box I think it's a good PDA, so check those 4 and 5 star reviews to see how long the users have had their PDAs before you buy 
 I subscribed to Modern Bride as a gift to my fiance.  Aside from not receiving our first issue until 3 months after the subscription, I only received about 3 issues total.  Months went by without anything being delivered.  While customer service at Modern Bride was very accomodating and helpful, nothing happens immediately.  When planning a wedding, each and every month is precious.  Especially during the initial stages of wedding planning.  To have finally gotten this subscription problem under control was exhausting.  Plus, by this time most of the wedding details were finalized, the magazines I received became useless.  If you're under 12 months to your wedding date, you should strongly consider if now is a good time to begin a subscription with Modern Bride 
 JAK books are, imho, one of the best in the market right now.Her stories are spun from a truly talented mind, with determined yet understanding heroines and dark brooding heroes, and laced with humour and wit that never fail to bring smiles and laughter. PERFECT PARTNERS however, sadly lacked this winning JAK formula. It comes across as an absolutely frustrating novel, with a bossy and oftentimes irritating heroine, and a narrow-minded  henpecked hero.Definitely the worst JAK book around 
 Mr. McDevitt's treatise on Tactical Medicine is just that - a treatise.  Although he covered many areas of tactical EMS, most were just touched upon and certainly not enough information was supplied to educate uneducated or to inform the active practitioner.  The book has no scientific references.  It appears to be purely anecdotal.  Any firm fact to be found there is interspersed with unfounded opinion.  To the uninformed, the difference between fact and opinion would be difficult to sort out, to say the least 
 Silent No More is an interesting approach to promoting a greater understanding of Islam, in that it tracks the path towards understanding taken by author Paul Findley, who is himself a public figure.   I like the concept of tracking someone who begins basically ignorant of the Muslim faith and moves towards becoming an expert, but I'm not sure that the execution is all that good. Findley faces an almost-impossible task when he tries to share personal experiences as an elected official whose political career hasn't yet run its course. Knowing how down and dirty modern american politics can be, Findley must write every sentence as if its liable to be taken out of context and used to headline his opponent's next smear pamphlet. This restriction makes what could have been an honest and entertaining story an exercise in caution.   Reading this will indeed give you a greatly enhanced level of understanding of Islam, which is all the more important given recent world events, but you have to be prepared to slog through some rather boring prose.   I guess Findley felt a need to publish while the topical iron was hot, but I'm looking forward to reading his thoughts on the topic when he doesn't have to protect his image.  
 This book makes saltwater aquariums seem easier than they actually are. For one, I don't even think the book mentions the use of reverse osmosis or deionized water, which is strongly recommended by all marine aquarists. The author also doesn't mention the importance of live rock. In fact, he goes as far to advise against using live rock for fish-only tanks! Sure, you might be able to get away with not using live rock, but it won't be worth it in the long run. Also, I don't agree with the list of recommended filter combinations. One more thing, the book lists an air stone as essential equipment, but the only thing an air stone will do is aid evaporation and cause salt creep! If you have enough movement of water at the surface, you should get sufficient gas exchange. There is, however, one thing the book does get right: its strong recommendation of using a protein skimmer.  This book is easy to understand, but you won't be getting the best information 
 We were excited to order this book after reading the other reviews.  We have two adopted children - the oldest is now 4 and the youngest is 1 1/2.  We were VERY disappointed.  In its 33 pages, the book provided some nice art and a couple of nice sentiments in its 150 words - but nothing more.  While less may be more, there wasn't much value in this book for us.  We would recommend finding another book that would be more useful.  We're certainly still looking.. 
 I can't believe the audacity of Brad Steiger. It takes a lot of nerve, or very little honor, to publish a tome of obviously fake photos and ho-hum ghost stories that were admittedly lifted off various Internet sites.   Steiger has little respect for his sources: He rewrites their testimony into his own words, so that every single story and anecdote sounds the same. Not only that, but several phrases are used over and over--I lost count of how many times he spells out his wife's entire name instead of merely referring to her as "my wife" or "Sherry."   It's also frustrating reading about some spectacular photo his wife took, or that was given to him, that shows clearly some spectral phenomenon or UFO--and the photo isn't anywhere in the book. The photos that do appear are of the tired and debunked ilk of orbs, double-exposure photos, even one photo of a paper cutout head GLUED to someone's shoulder!   The only thing scary about this book is that it's supernaturally LAME 
 As other reviewers noted the book is abound with upper body nudity and some rather indecent panty shots (Which are made all the more hilarious by little warnings "Be careful not to draw the crotch in too much detail. Otherwise the affect is obscene" they should have told the illustrators that. Despite pages on n the jiggling of the breast drawing the female face and portraying different female characters is almost non-existent. Add into that the poor illustrations and the affect is a pure waste of money. The illustrations were rather crude and unrefined and not something you want to aspire to. If you really want to draw female characters check out Volume 2 of "more How to Draw Manga" by go office. Although, the title is officially penning characters there's a lot about female body types and the art is consistently top notch. It also briefly talks about women's eyes, a very important feature of any manga character. Just save your money and don't bother with this title 
 Of all the irrational political books on the market, this ranks among the worst. It's worse than Michael Moore as far as innacuracy and lack of evidence of mental strength. It would seem that Bowen has just enough functioning neural connection to write, gather random unverified stories and maintain a paranoid outlook, beyond that I guess he must at least have a functioning brain stem. Nearly everything in this book can (or has been) easily refuted. Nothing more than a middle school students efforts at critical thinking can refute his claims. The fact that idiots are out there buying this and believing it is both scary and disappointing. Nothing new I guess 
 I would imagine it was the cheap, crummy power supply, but mine wouldn't even light up...dead...One wonders why a $200 component can't run on 110 volts?  I'd try it again if they re-worked the power supply, but not if I have to use a DC adapter like a $3 item. 
 A woman chasing a man to this extent is not romantic.It was like a foxhunt with her trying to run the fox to ground,at any moment I expected her to yell "tallyho!" It's ok to give Warren a nudge but this girl was outrageously ridiculously too forward to be believable.I finally got through it by skipping the more outrageous parts. Of course Warren was no dreamboat either.Unfeeling is the best I can come up with to describe him.To be fair to him though he tried to warn her about not setting her cap for him and constantly referred to her as little girl in order to discourage her.Alas she didn't take the hint.Halfway through the novel I still had no idea why she was chasing Warren.What qualities of his caused her to believe herself in love with him? I don't believe he fell in love with her either,he gave in so she'd stop chasing him 
 Having to read this book for a Mysticism class I was appalled at the irresponsible and totally inacurate information slanderously thrown together.  This book pastes Dionisus into any form utilizing kindergarden techniques.  The author claims to have spoken with Dr. C. G. Jung, but his lack of knowledge suggests strongly that he has only glanced at Jung's collected works.  Ecstacy is an insult to any educated person in the ways of psychology, religion, pagan philosophies, inner spirituality and growth.  Personally, it should be removed from all bookstores and book outlets as it is a pathetic excuse for writing.  In short, do not read this book 
  Yes, this is the great PBBB's 2nd album, but it's not the CD you should be buying.  This domestic CD was released in 1990 and has never been remastered.    The import 2CD version of this title (backed with the PBBB's 1st album) is the one to get.  It was remastered by Bob Irwin in 2001.  Ditto for "Pigboy Crabshaw" & "In My Own Dream"; the 2004 import 2CD is also remastered (and sounds incredible) and the domestic CD's are not.  Why WEA and Elektra have not made these four remasters available domestically is a mystery.  Don't waste your money on these inferior versions: Get the imports 
 This book is totally useless.  I've contacted several places listed in the book to no avail.  This will NOT help you make money and does not lead to any "free" money anywhere.  Keep the money you have 
 While this is a good quick reference guide, I have found that I have needed another book for most things.  This would probably be good for kids as long as parents have another source for more detailed reference 
 Nothing in Nazneen's life has ever been under her control.  Even her birth itself was left to fate: she seemed to be stillborn but then she finally took her first breath and fate allowed her to live.  This story was told to her throughout her childhood in Bangladesh, and she learned that it was futile to fight against fate.  When her father announces that she, at eighteen, is to go to London to marry a forty-year-old man named Chanu, Nazneen doesn't argue.  London is lonely.  Nazneen doesn't speak English, is discouraged from making many friends and can't really relate to her husband, a selfish and pompous man who seems to think himself overly kind because he doesn't beat his wife.  She tries being passive and going along with her life.  Then she tries rebelling in small ways but is frustrated when Chanu doesn't seem to notice she's neglected her housekeeping duties.  It is only when Nazneen and Chanu's baby boy is in the hospital that Nazneen begins to appreciate her husband's good qualities and she also experiences some moments of pure happiness.  Throughout the next twenty years or so, though, Nazneen is unable to hold onto that happiness.  It is only when she finds out that her husband finally has taken steps to put into action one of his long-discussed plans that she is spurred to action.  This book, for me, was one long and depressing chore to read.  Nazneen allowed herself to be a slave to her fate, but the entire book was a detailed list of all of the ways in which her life was completely unbearable.  I found it agonizing to read about someone who was so thoroughly unhappy all of the time, and it made me anxious to read about the ways in which Chanu continued to mess up the lives of Nazneen and their children.  The book had an uplifting ending, but it was so abrupt that it seemed unrealistic and jarring, instead of the relief it should have been. 
 This book has some great ideas, but some of the cakes shown and described are actually character scenes, the base of which are the actual cakes, and the decorations are almost all sculptures made of fondant or marzipan. (I  didn't even know what those were until lately.) Although I did admire  Debbie Brown's talent and expertise, the techniques used and suggested were  VERY intimidating. What ever happened to old fashioned butter cream  frosting and decorator bags? I guess if you're into modeling clay, though,  you could get some good ideas from this book 
 I ONLY READ THIS BOOK B/C I HAD TO FOR ONE OF MY MANY ENGLISH COURSES, AND IT WAS EXTREMLEY BORING! MAYBE B/C I JUST IM NOT ATTRACTED TO BOOKS ABOUT POLITICS, AND IN THIS CASE FASCHISM.I'LL GIVE LEWIS THE CREDIT FOR PREDICTING WHATS ALREADY SEEMING TO HAPPEN IN 2006 U.S.A, BUT THIS BOOK IS PRETTY DANG BORIN'...SORR 
 Despite what appears to be the vast majority of opinions on this book, I found this book very difficult to get through. What De Pree writes as "authoritative" leadership concepts, I see as nothing more than common sense. Perhaps I have been blessed to work in a company that touts similar values and beliefs or perhaps I am just a person that already believes that it is the diversity of people that is what makes a company successful. But I found dredging through De Pree's long lists of leadership principles exhaustive and frustrating. I didn't find this book revolutionary (which is how he seems to write it) or even particularly interesting. "Man's Search For Meaning" is a FAR more compelling leadership read... 
 Most alternative science books tend to collapse during their second act,once the premise is established and the reader is persuaded to furtherinvestigate the claims of the author.  Having read dozens of tomes by`maverick' science authors who claim they are breaking away from and challenging mainstream science institutions, I have detected a pattern that often betrays their assertions that they are truly contributing to theinevitable merging of science/spirituality and initiating a `paradigm shift`. How? Primarily by tabulating how many times I have come across the following in all the years of serious investigation into so called alternative science by reading dozens of books in this genre:  1.  The Hundreth Monkey  2. The Butterfly Effect  3. Schroedinger's Cat      The above listed examples have, through sheer repetition, concretized into mind numbing dogma now and hardly serve to inspire anymore (if they ever did in the first place).  The flapping wings of the butterfly do not create a hurricane a thousand miles away.  Rather the hangovers of  USFA personnel responsible for the implementation of  Project Cloverleaf do.  Other than George W. Bush, there is no hundredth monkey and there never was (apparently the story of yam washing simians was pure fiction).   As for Schroedinger's Cat, I think I saw a WANTED: DEAD OR ALIVE poster with the feline's mug on it, in some ghost town laboratory tour I took in the outback of  Los Alamos, New Mexico.         When I attempted to delve into what I thought would be an exciting,promising book on the Akashic records by the superlatively touted, Club of Rome member Ervin Laszlo, i.e., the universal templates that record every and all phenomena that occurs in the cosmos, I was confronted with the same hypnotizing  Quantum 101 crap I've read so many times in the past. What is being exposed overall is an utter poverty of imagination and severance from living, metaphorical realms, realms which could very well serve as a catalyst for authentic paradigm shifts.   It is evident that that authors like Laszlo haven't escaped the materialist/reductionist conditioning of their very own training, even if they claim they have.  That they have been molded according to the dictates of those who hold the keys to science itself and are used as pleased becomes more and more obvious if one scrutinizes more closely the so called metaphors they employ to spin their works and cast a spell on the reader.  Even more telling is the blurb on the inside cover page by Ashok Gangadean, director of The Global Dialogue Institute who says:     `...the reader who encounters this book will be irrevocably transformed and will henceforth experience the world through a global lens.'      I'm left wondering just exactly what that global lens consists of.  Perhaps that Illuminati surveillance camera otherwise know as the  Eye in the Pyramid?  Several other red flags popped up in Laszlo's book, hinting that he hasn't broken free of the conditioning and intense behavior modification scientists are subjected to by their patron overlords.  Laszlo dares to fancy himself as the next Einstein, moving beyond the gravity of relativity theory into a vastly more rarified definition of  the universe as a `coherent fine tuned interconnected whole'.  He even provides a graphic depiction of this so called progression on page 120 with himself now at the vanguard.   If he fancieshimself as such a profound successor to Einstein, where is the tangible evidence of his claim?    In this reviewer's reductionistic opinion, the only thing that will ever create a tangible paradigm shift or help us to fully realize the `fine tuned interconnected whole' that the universe is supposedly is, will be the global development and implementation of free energy technology, a technology that already exists but has been ruthlessly oppressed, its inventors conveniently murdered and their devices shelved away forever.  The shift isn't going to happen with alternative scientists pontificating ad nauseum on Akashic fields, Grand Unified Theories of Everything, and whatever other forms of packaged air they want to distract the public with 
 For a movie like "Hellboy" where half the experience is spent trying to catch up, a novelization provides some opportunity to understand the parts that flew by. I hoped to learn more about why things were happening; instead, I was treated to a novelization in the most literal sense, where the author essentially described the images and recorded the dialog in the movie and didn't add one bit of back story. If you've seen the movie, don't bother with this book. If you haven't seen the movie, don't bother with this book. 
  I have listened to this cd, also watched the dvd, of John Fogerty's long road home on amazon. Nothing can compare to his Dvd of Premonition.I own It love it, Put it on and  makes me  rock out, With one of the best entertainers In his prime time of life.The guitars and Instruments he plays is awesome to watch a legend of great talent.His voice Is so excellent & clear.Had some friends over with John's Premonition dvd playing.It took all of us back to that time In history.They all went to amazon and bought Premonition.I know soon they will all be gone.I went back to buy one more the price is so reasonable.As I consider Premonition to be a Collector's dvd.If you see it again.Do not wait buy it while they are available. I know its a Import as most dvds are today.Mine plays excellent In audio and picture.You feel like you are sitting in the audience with John performing.Give Premonition 10 Stars.Anything after John's Premonition dvd can not compare to it.No matter how hard they try to bring back his music on a Cd or a dvd.Premonition Is the best dvd  of all of times. All the rest get 1 Star for trying. Though not coming close to what I call  my Collector's Edition  dvd of John Fogerty's Prmonition.  
 This book is an absolute rip-off.  Crude drawings surround chapters devoted to the most common stances and thrusts; given fancy, exotic names.   The historian in me enjoyed the author's recollections of life in Sicily  fifty (or so) years ago.  However, as a knife fighter's text, this book  lacks 
 I bought this because it looked like a comprehensive resource for a H.O. that could be stuffed in my pocket, but I found myself in a bind with this book.  I think it might be useful in England, but if you are not ready to work with British units and medication names it is pretty tough to use in an American hospital.  I found myself scrambling for other resources when I  tried to use this book.  I wish I would have bought something else 
 This film gives a good overview of what life is and was like in Tibet before and after China took over Tibet. It gives a good view of what the Dali Lhama is all about and of Tibetan spiritual life in general. The cinematography is beautiful. Anyone even remotely interested in what Tibet and what the Dali Lhama are about would enjoy this film 
 This movie was a terrible disappointment for me.  It aspires to be some weird fusion of a traditional Western and a madcap spoof à la A HARD DAY'S NIGHT and falls totally flat.   The minstrel team of Nat King Cole and Stubby Kaye pop up at pivotal moments singing a series of forgettable ditties that grate on the nerves as the movie wears on.    Lee Marvin spends most of the time balancing himself unsteadily on his horse and acting like the proverbial town drunk.  For the most part, it's a charmless and embarrassingly mannered performance unworthy of a high school thespian. I have to wonder if Academy members were sucking on the same bottle as Marvin's bumbling character, Kid Shelleen, before handing him the Oscar for this dreadful piece of acting.    Most of the supporting cast is also weak, or maybe it's just the quality of the material they're forced to work with that makes them seem so.    Jane Fonda is really the only reason to watch this film.  She plays the archetypal naive schoolmarm who falls in with the wrong crowd, but despite the role's limitations she delivers her lines with moxie and pluck. It's a joy simply to  watch her gesticulate, so captivating are her charms.  Too bad her talents and Marvin's are wasted in this tedious farce of a farce.    If you want to watch an intelligent Western that successfully mixes snarky humour with action and suspense, try BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID instead.  
 This book is sure to please right-wingers who like to denigrate liberals as "elitist'. It does a good job of pointing out (old) issues in which the left did not succeed in all of the goals of liberal programs, without a hint that the things the right-wing was trying did not work either. In Sowells' view, everything was hunky-dory in the 50s, and if only the liberals would have left things alone, poverty would have been eliminated, cars would naturally have become safer, and the God "free-market" would have worked his magic to cure societal ills such as out-of-wedlock births, the plight of black americans, and the AIDS epidemic.   Interestingly, Sowell uses the word 'anointed' a biblical term favored by evangelicals and the current neo-cons in power as they pander to the religious right, to describe a type of liberal he doesn't like. His disregard for the Left ruins any chance that anyone except a right-wing ditto-head will enjoy this book.   Sowell denigrates the Left's use of statistics, just prior to using the same statistics to "prove" his points. "Aha"!   Ignoring the last 12 years or so, Sowell asserts that it is the Left who try to tell people what to do, and use the government to rule people.  Right. And Fox news is fair and balanced.   If you are a right-winger, you will enjoy reading his preaching to the choir of how bad liberals are, and the revelation that their motives (help the poor; seek justice for all Americans; provide for a healthy life...) are really a justification to tell "the benighted" what to do.  If you are a thinking person, you will be mostly  satisfied by everything except Sowell's utter disregard for those who don't agree with him.  For those seeking a balanced look at our societies' problems, how we can solve them, and how we came to be in the current mess, you will have to look elsewhere. Sowell's disdain permeates the book and makes his assumptions (based on the same type of thinking he hates in the Left) not worth trusting.  In short, another attack-book, albeit this time from someone with a brain. 
 I still have not received the product ordered yet, so I am unable to rate at this time.  I knew it would be late, but hoped it would be here by now.  It is a very late gift at this point.  
 My main motivation in seeing this movie was to better understand the reputation of Echo Park, a little area nestled next to downtown Los Angeles. I moved to Echo Park in late 2004.  It's depressing - the vicious cycle of drugs, dropping-out, and  domestic violence. And it's all here, told through the eyes of Latina teenagers. It was easy to see the woman's hand on the direction of the piece with the important roles that women played.  I didn't care for the movie as a whole because it felt sluggish and uneven. I also found myself not caring about any of the characters. So-and-so gets shot, la la loo goes to jail. Whatever!  As an aside, though, the evil neighborhood druglord was called Ernesto. It turns out my next-door neighbor in real-life is also called Ernesto. Luckily, it's just a coincidence 
 I enjoy reading, but I am a very visual person and was disappointed in this book because while it offers suggestions that make sense, it takes longer to get through the book since it is practically all words and very  few pictures for inspiration 
 for ads only pretty much. there is not much to read or learn for the common reader. it seems like it's mailing for the fashion elite not for everyone. 
 I had to get this book because my school required it but if I had the choice I would look for a better book.  This book has no answers in the back and a select few on the book resources.  The example problems are not very helpful  and the book is confusing in almost every way 
 HART'S WAR had potential. The last months of World War Two as a backdrop with demoralized GI's crammed into an overcrowded POW compound.  If this picture was soley about the hardships endured by surrendered soldiers during the Battle of the Bulge, then it could have had a chance.  Instead the film makers took on too many plots and subplots.    Unintentionally the movie borrows from SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, A SOLDIER'S STORY, THE GREAT ESCAPE and STALAG 17.  A cardinal rule in war films is that the premise has to be simple.  In HART'S WAR we find some good elements lost in a virtual Mulligan stew.    In the story Colin Farrell's character, a rear echelon lawyer, accompanies another officer on what he thinks is a joyride.  Unfortunately for Farrell, the Germans have launched their attack in the Ardennes. The young lawyer is captured, harshly interrogated, and finally shipped out to a German stalag.  There he meets the senior POW officer, played by Bruce Willis, and tries to settle down in the dirty and uncomfortable life of a POW.  A soldier is killed and a recently downed Tuskegee airman is accused of murder.  Yes, you guessed it.  Farrell takes on the aviator's defense during the subsequent courts martial.    If director Gregory Hoblit left the storyline to develop around the trial a decent film could have emerged.  Instead we have additions of Colonel Hart's unexplained behavior, an mass tunnel escape plot, sabotage and the German Commandant's attempt to befriend the American lawyer as superfluous baggage.  HART'S WAR was filmed in the Czech Republic, no doubt to cut costs.   A little more effort and a lot less story and this film would have had a better showing at the box office.  Still, if you enjoy war movies you should probably add this DVD to your collection 
 You'd think 50 or Sheridan was smart enough to base the movie on someone other than 50-well, it was supposed to be loosely based on his life, but that's dangerously territory to tread. It was way more funny than it was thuggin'. It wasn't completely a waste. It was good for a few laughs from time to time. If you think this is bad, check out Cam'ron's Killa Season. That movie flat-out sucks, but it sold more on the streets than 50's dud did in theaters! 
 i love terry pratchett's work; i've read plenty of great discworld books, and even a few that i thought were just mediocre (by pratchett standards) but this book is crap. just a sorry pitiful excuse for bringing back rincewind from the nether regions. if you've never read terry pratchett, do NOT start with this. and if you're just dying to know how Rincewind got back into the discworld... well, save yourself the 5 bucks and dream up your own story, its bound to be better than this. i don't feel that pratchett put his best efforts into this, rather, i get the impression someone begged him to bring back rincewind, maybe shoved some money in his face until finally, the author said, "yeah, fine, i'll write it tonight while i'm on the toilet" i just wished he'd flushed 
 The book covers the information but does not lay it out in a form that is clear and concise. I will give you an example. The FSMO roles that DC's host can be seized if absolutely necessary, causing you to reformat the server. However it does not go into these in any reasonable detail. It skims the surface and leaves much to the imagination on what can be seized without messing things up and what can't, like the PDC role that can be seized but does not require a reformat of the original server.   Also the software that came with this book is BAD. I would say 90% of the questions are accurite and should be believed 100% however there was a question on FSMO roles like the one above that blatenly stated that if a PDC role is seized that the server must be reformatted completely. That is completely WRONG and both the Exam cram book and the microsoft references acknowledge that as being incorrect. So don't trust the sample tests from the software that comes from this book 
 I made a big decision to invest this expensive cleaver, but very dispointed after first use. It is not sharp, it is difficult to cut through meat and bones. Maybe it is the cleaver for professionals because they know how to sharpen and hone it on daily basis. 
 Let me start off by saying that if you haven't read any of Gerritsen's books featuring her two main characters, don't even consider reading this book. So much about the characters deeply depends on your being familiar with their history. Even if you have read other books with these characters, The Mephisto Club, while starting off with a lot of suspense, is a disappointment. The plot drags and requires you to suspend belief way too much, there are too many subplots that are left dangling, and the ending -- what there is of one -- is weak and unsatisfying. All in all, I'd advise you to skip The Mephisto Club. Your time and money are too valuable to spend on a book that, at best, is mediocre 
 As a professional art historian who teaches twentieth century art at public university, I find this book to be virtually worthless. Not only do the authors leave out artists from their book because they don't adhere to their own rigid ideological orthodoxies, but the book is very badly written; they undermine their own arguments by constantly lapsing into semi-meaningless jargon. A good postmodernist/ Marxist perspective in a general introduction to twentieth century would be useful, but these authors are too inept and arrogant to bring it off 
 I typed in the ISBN of my text book SOM which is one of my most favorite books in the world.  I found the electronic version and bought it immediately as I will be taking a course on the Roots of Science of Mind and wanted an electronic as well as hard copy version.  Unfortunately, the electronic version is NOT the full text.  It does not even follow the full text version.  I was very disappointed and am still searching for the complete electronic version 
 I was amazed at how sophomoric and amateurish was this great writer's first novel.  Stout was obviously a competent wordsmith, even at the beginning, but appeared hopelessly far from ever becoming an author of merit.  "Her Forbidden Knight" reads like a college Creative Writing major's attempt to create a Harlequin Romance.  It's worth reading, however, to illustrate the way a writer can grow.  Placed alongside one of the later Nero Wolfe novels, it may serve as inspiration for an aspiring author who has not yet gotten the hang of it and fears that s/he never will 
 I found this book vacuous and jejune.  And frankly, I met the author (without knowing who he was) and he tried to pick me up, and I've never heard such a pile of cr.. in my life.  And I'm not even close to beautiful.  So good luck with his advise 
 I thought it would be really cool to be part of a society that wore red hats in public.  Being part of a club where one could identify another club member because they are wearing a certain item of clothes while in public, fascinates me.  But then I started reading the book.  I found the characters non-believable.  The rules of the club, do overs and make overs were just too restrictive.  Life is not about squashing dialogue with your friends because you are too uncomfortable or too polite to say what is on your mind.  The scene about catching Harold in the act truly stretched my imagination.  The amounts of money thrown around boggled my mind.  And the ending?  It reminded me of the last episode of Seventh Heaven 
 Warning to all those who are reading this for a school assignment: you may think that an "enriched classic" is simply the text with commentary also included. Not so, with this book. They shouldn't call it an "enriched classic". They should call it "dumbed down for lazy readers. 
 Can anyone convince me that this books worth the time i spent reading it? not entertaining, not enlightening and definitely not useful. Give credit for using somany examples, but no, just call it "The long introduction  to Stigma", theres no meat in the pie 
 Before purchasing Made in Detroit I read the reader reviews.  The reviews were so mixed that I decided against buying the book and checked it out of the library instead.  As it turns out I made the best decision.  All I can say is `thank you fellow reviewers'; this book was definitely not worth the purchase price.  My statement has nothing to do with the author's writing skills, he is a skilled writer.  It has everything to do with his lack of insight.  That Paul Clemens could live in a city and have such a skewed view of it is downright scary.  I read the book, waiting for Paul to have a revelation that would help him put the pieces of his life together and make peace with them.  But after 241 pages he was no more enlightened than he was on page one.  Blacks are caricatures whose sole role in life is to make Paul's life hard.  Women are peripheral characters who are barely given a voice.  He finds a way to put down and demean everyone who is not a white male in his book.    If you are a white male who harbors secret racist feelings you will enjoy this book and it will validate your feelings.  If you are anyone else your reaction will no doubt range from mild boredom to outrage.  As I read this book I felt sadness, a profound sense of dismay and had some of my worse fears confirmed.  (There are white folks who actually still think like this.)  My hope is that the light comes on for Paul, he is still young.  If it does maybe he will share his insights with us.   
 First of all, let's talk about the noise level on this thing.  YIKES!  That should be against some kind of consumer protection law. The blowdryer part is ok, but didn't like the brushes at all.  I'll go back to my Conair stying brush and my straightener. Live and learn 
 This is by far the worst action/adventure book I have ever read.  I'm surprised that aliens didn't show up at the end to fight against everybody else...  How this book ever got a top review is beyond me.  Please do not waist your tim 
 I've run out of patience.  I stuck with 'em through Be Here Now and everything after.  They said some great song called Stop the Clocks was going to be on this.  There's an acoustic rocker that plays in the trailer for their upcoming movie.  There's a nice melodic slow moving number that plays on a different trailer.  So...in the end...what do we get? A lazy mix tape of stuff we all already have. I understand greatest hits albums are made up of songs that were already released.  And they get one star for re doing a song.  However, I never thought I'd see the day that I'd give Oasis one star.  Unfortunately, today's the day.  It's simply out of disappointment.  These days it seems they're doing a little too much talking and not enough walking.  Mad ferit? Barely.

 I have read or tried to read a number of Laymon books.  For some reason I always feel the need to shower afterwards.  However, I have enjoyed a couple - Blood Games was entertaining and I loved One Rainy Night. This one I did not enjoy.  I tried twice to read it and gave up both times.  If you've never read a book by Laymon - this is not the one to start with 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 On the surface, John Waters has it all -- a loving wife, a beautiful child, a successful business -- but appearances are deceiving. His marriage is in trouble, his business is under investigation by a federal agency, and his business partner has made questionable financial decisions which jeopardize everyone's future. Into this mix wanders Eve Sumner, a stunningly attractive woman who makes it abundantly obvious she's chosen Waters as her next conquest. However, appearances are again deceiving, because Eve Sumner claims she is actually Mallory Chandler, Waters' first great love.  Funny thing, though: Mallory Chandler died ten years previously.  So who is this woman? And how does she know things only Mallory should know?  In an effort to discover the truth, Waters finds himself involved in an affair that quickly turns dangerous, as Eve/Mallory displays the same obsessive behavior that destroyed Waters' love for Mallory twenty years before.  This novel requires a major suspension of disbelief for its critical plot device: transmigration of a soul. Once the reader accepts that, however, the story moves along quickly and works well within its preposterous premise. Waters flails and fumbles and does his best to fix the mess he's made by getting involved with Eve/Mallory, even as she seems to be setting him up for a murder charge. His desperation and fear are palpable, and certainly mitigate his at times wrong-headed choices. I truly enjoyed this story, that is, until I read the final pages.  The final plot twist, which I won't reveal here, is so farfetched, even within the confines of a plot that stretches suspension of disbelief to its outermost limit, as to spoil all the good trashiness that preceded it. I read the last few pages and threw the book across the room. I felt cheated. I think Mr. Iles wrote himself into a corner and couldn't think of any other way to give the reader a happy ending. Gah.  Never have I been so disappointed with a novel's resolution.  Oh, and the frequent references to a novel written by a character within this novel which happens to have the same title as a novel written by Iles bugged me too.  Gah.  Oh. Go ahead and read the story. Just rewrite the ending in your own head. I did 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 This was really, really bad.  I read about 1/4 the way through then had to quit 
 then this isn't for you. Horrible after bite that gives it a unique flavor that I definately don't care for...not to say that you will not however. If you are in search of a generic oriented flavored coffee, this isn't the one to try 
 The series started off so well, it's sad to see it end so badly. This book is just a collection of random events, there really isn't a plot. None of the questions raised throughout the series are answered.  The first book was great, I wish I had stopped there. 
 The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly.  This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into "victimhood" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.  Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer.  
 First, let me say I wanted to love this book. The first O'brien book I read was The Things They Carried, a masterpeice. I suggest to all who were turned off by July July to please read this before writing him off. He has enormous talent, but this book didn't show any of it. The characters are barely credible. The setting of the reunion seems as if the characters dropped into a twilight zone scenario: they can and do haunt the Darton Hall campus in the wee hours, no buildings are locked, no security guards are ushering them out of the door, as if the campus is a ghost town, a mere prop waitng empty for thirty years instead of a real place with a whole new set of students. The dialogue of most characters not only sounds the same, but has the same style in that many scenes end with a character emitting what is meant to be a clever quip. On a more positive note, the sub-tales are mostly quite good, such as David Todd's tale in 'nam (I loved Johnny Ever, the most interesting character in the book), the tale of the lover who drowns (reminded me of a story by Richard Ford), and most of all Marv's tale. Tim, if you are reading this don't be discouraged. I know you have some better stuff in you. Maybe you got a little lazy or contrived on this one. Best of luck on your next effort 
 I've read some Faulkner now, some required, most voluntarily, and still have yet to figure out what the fuss is about. Yes he can weave a story, but good grief, imagine the ego of a man who thinks he can turn out a story as incomprehensible as this. Right now I'm reading his bio by Jay Parini trying to decipher the Faulkner code.  I'll let you know if I do. I guess I've just read too much Flannery O'Conner (brilliant) and consider Faulkner a bit too precious. Slam me if you must. "A Light in August" was good, and I'm reading short stories that are wonderful, but please, present and future authors, try to engage the reader, not send him/her away frustrated 
 My first exposure to Fourplay was "Between the Sheets" which I really like.  I guess I was expecting more of the same.  I think there is such a thing as too mellow and this appears to be it. I've listened to it 3  times now and it's still not growing on me.  There's no polite way to say  it, it's just boring 
 Hirigoyen should have based his book on the french basque recepies and left the spanish basque recepies to the ones who know better. I have not seen a single spanish basque dish in the book that is authentic! Hirigoyen  should know that we never cook with butter and white pepper 
 1- President Bush is building a base on the moon as our forward post for attacking evil aliens on Pluto. Just today we launched a ship toward pluto to start our attack.  2- A secret Cabal of Sceintologists have taken over the Defense Department and a working for Donald Rumsfeld who is actually L. Ron Hubbard come back from the dead.  3- Right Wing activists invented alcohol and drugs through funds from Jack Abramoff in order to make money for Tom Delay's trial.  4- Samuel Alito is actually Pat Robertson under a mission impossible style mask.  5- Edmund Burke and John Adams planned the JFK assination nearly 200 years before it happened and left notes in fortune cookies to tell their plans to future generations.  If you believe any of the above then you will love Brock's book. If not then its not the book for you 
 to my dissapointment, not everything by the original daevid allen era gong is indispensable. this is radio gnome invisible pt. 1 with  the finest space rock lineup anyone could hope for but the final result of this album comes of sounding like a tentative rehearsal where in many places allen scats some of the songs' improvisations and their arrangement lacks coherence and development. instrumentation is limited to supporting the vocals and chants and rarely gets the opportunity to expound any ideas or feel each other out. in the end, daevid allen displays some infectious song writing ability but it appears that the new members just weren't ready to record yet. this is steve hillage's first appearance for gong but you wouldn't know it as his guitar is barely noticeable. things change remarkably for the next albums 'angels egg' and 'you' which are two of the greatest psychedelic albums ever recorded 
 Most of the items were fine. They were just given as gifts with 4 damaged. I have tried to return without success. I am disappointed that I am not able to return damaged or not functioning items. I may think twice about ever doing this agai 
 This book is supposed to be a basic overview of Islamic history from the sixth century to the eleventh century.  The problem is that if you are a beginning student of Islam it throws way to many names in rapid succession at you with not enough in depth discussion for you to remember any of them.  On the other hand if you are an expert in the field you probably know you all these people are and there is not enough analysis to make it worth your time. Compounding the problem is the ridiculous price of fifty dollars for a paperback 
 I wans't really sure what to expect when I picked this book up off of Amazon. I'd heard it was something kind of like Otherkin, but not using that term. I was a little leery when I saw that the author was a very popular, angels-are-all-sweetness-and-light New Age icon, but decided to give it a try anyway.  Talk about Otherkin Lite.  "Earth Angels" are basically people who are reincarnated "elementals" (read: therianthropes, elves and fae Otherkin), angels (read: angelkin), starpeople (read: aliens), Wise Ones (read: people who worked magic in a past life) and walk-ins. Okay, that's not so very different from what a lot of Otherkin believe.  However, it's how she explains the phenomenon of people who were not human in other lives that ruins the book for me. First off, the way you determine what type of "Earth Angel" you are is basically a 30-question "Are you like this? How about this?" quiz that would fit in perfectly on Quizilla--samples of questions are whether you're overweight, if you dye your hair, if you're of Celtic ancestry, whether you're good at handling money or not, if you practice Reiki, or believe in magic. Supposedly these things tell you what type of Earth Angel you are (never mind that pretty much everything she asks about are things that are common among garden-variety humans, too).  Then, her information about each group is not only based on stereotyped behavior and belief patterns that are common among everyday humans as well as 'kin, but it's really, really, really white-light and saccharine. For example, she says that all incarnated elementals are major environmentalists, always happy (but prone to mood swings), and "physically robust". And as far as the whole Wise Ones thing goes, a lot of it plays right into the Atlantean thing--the whole "Oh, magic isn't for regular people--anyone who works magic must be at a higher vibrational level than everyone else!" thing as well as the Burning Times persecution complex. All walk-ins, on the other hand, supposedly walked in because they have some mission to fulfill.  And speaking of missions, according to this book, all Earth Angels are here for the purpose of Saving the World!  I don't doubt that the author ran into a lot of people who, were they in the Otherkin community, would be considered Otherkin. However, this book shows a distinct lack of skepticism and self-questioning, things that are common in the Otherkin community. Instead, it tells readers exactly what they want to hear--"You love nature, so you must be an Incarnated Elemental!" or "You love helping people and often find yourself in codependent relationships--you must be an Incarnated Angel!" While the end of each chapter on specific types of Earth Angels does have some tips on how to counteract the negative aspects of being whatever you are, it's assumed that by answering the spiffy little quiz at the beginning that you are an Earth Angel--there's nothing on questioning yourself further, only how to fulfill your God-given mission!  If you think being other than human is a great way to feel special, feel free to pick this up.  Otherwise, save your money 
 Laura Shumar read my mind when she posted her review.    Bujold is by far my favorite writer, living or dead.  Hers is the only fiction, other than Shakespeare's, that I read with pencil in hand so that I can mark special passages.  I have read all of her books multiple times, with the exception of "Diplomatic Immunity."  "The Hallowed Hunt" will now join it on the far end of the shelf.    I will still buy her next book as soon as it is available, but with trepidation 
 I cannot say that I learned much about the Internet through this book.  The book was too simplistic for a regular Internet user.  The generalizations were repeated over and over throughout the chapters, which made the book fairly boring.  Also, the information in the chapters was commonsense based information.  If anyone has any knowledge about the Internet, this book is not for you.  Most high schoolers could probably give you the answers to the questions approached by Castells.  This book is not worth the price paid, I am sorry I ever bought it 
 The book is a swamp of innuendo and distortion and half-truths.  Example: go look at a good color reproduction of Eakins' "William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River" and decide for yourself if the nude figure looks like a boy.  Adams says it's the figure of a boy and proves Eakins' repressed homosexuality.  Huh?  Upon such unsupported assertions is this book built.  And Eakins' famous "Swimming Hole"--yes, the painting celebrates the young male body, and childless Eakins was like a father for some of his students.  One can't, as a male, celebrate the male body without raising questions about one's sexuality?  I think my two sons' bodies are beautiful, as is my daughter's.  And the lack of photos of Tom and Susan supposedly says something dark about their marriage.  What the lack of photos speaks to is the lack of photos.  To indicate a problem in a marriage requires positive evidence.  And then there's....well, you get the point.  Fortunately, I have faith that Eakins and his work will easily survive this shameless and self-promoting trashing.  It would be fun to play Freud with Adams as he does with Eakins but let's not stoop to the author's level 
 this just sucks the main person just keeps running around. He just keeps running and or walking which is controlled thru the key board.no fwd bike control,he won't peddle, but gos backwards quite well.Tryed different setups reloads and nothing worked. Atleast I bought it used and for not much money.Maybe ill find a fix and try it again later 
 This books tells the amazing story of the notorious House Unamerican Activities Committee, 1938 to l968, and tells it in a highly dramatic way -- presenting the reader with the actual dialogues that took place in the committee room. It is a tale of folks you have heard of, but never seen in this light before -- among the names are Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, Gary Cooper, Paul Robeson, Jerome Robbins, Zero Mostel, Elia Kazan...,and on and on. A rogues' gallery? Well,judge for yourself which guys are the rogues and which the heroes (if any)...In any event, the book is a terrific read 
 You get what you pay for. These are extremely poorly made. They were slapped together with mis-shaped finger holes and seams. Cheap and fall apart at the slights movement 
 I will probably get shot for saying this. But Jennifer Hudson is NO Jennifer Holiday. She my have a strong voice, but it's not Holiday strong (not to mention as skilled) If you want to hear these songs at their best, get the Broadway soundtrack.  
 The film basically follows two groups of characters, one is a young girl named Julie, who wants to prove to a group of girls in a club called The Sisters that she got what it takes to join the club, despite her not being in the in crowed. The other group is a husband and wife couple, where the wife is a daughter of a recently deceased powerful psychic.After his death, a number of questions have been brought up, especially since his body was found with a number of others. We later learn that  he discovers a way to suck the life force  out of people, which grants him great power, and after his death his power somehow grows even stronger. Back to Meg Till's chracter, she finally has one last step to prove that she can make it in the club, which just so happens to be spending the night in a mausoleum that now houses the body of the psychic. Thinking they can scare the hell out of the eager Julie, the girls dawn Hollween masks and props , and set out to the mausoleum. It doesn't take long before the psychic's powers escape his coffin and awaken the dozens of rotting corpses that lay side by side, leaving the deceased man's daughter possibly the only one to put a stop to the madness. For an 80's movie this film surprisingly focuses more on building  the story rather than the typical cheesy deaths and T&A to keep the pace going. For those patient enough to watch the first half of the film you might be  pleasantly surprise by the out come. I know I was. I wanted to like the movie more, and I seriously considered a better rating , but I just counld'nt get into the slow pacing as much as I wanted to. Overall a underated 80's movie that doesn't rely on chessy deaths and gratuatous nudity to keep the audience attention. Check this if you're looking for an above average B-flick 
 I should have paid more attention to the reviews...I was warned ahead of time that this crate shouldn't be used as an everyday or long-term solution. We've been using the crate for LESS THAN three months and already the zipper one one end (that we use all the time) is screwed up and half the time it doesn't open. At least one of the two zippers on that end can still move so the dog can get in and out, but I'm afraid of the morning when I try to open it and both zippers are fully stuck. (We leave one end open and place the crate up against the bathroom so the dog can at least have a little room to roam plus still have her crate to sleep in. When she gets a little older, we will leave her in her crate all day.) We could still use the zippers on the top, but we don't like those since the dog can't get in and out at her leisure.   Although in general it's a nice crate, I probably would not buy this item again just due to the poor quality of the zippers--hence the two stars. I am completely surprised that we only got three months' use out of it before the zippers bit the dust. We've already purchased a different, sturdier, latch-style crate that we're much happier with...and we should have bought to start with 
 but this abridgement is the poorest that I have ever heard or read. There were many elements left out of the story, including some that were mentioned on the cover! With all the missing elements of the story, I'm sure there were nuances that were totally missed, leaving just a fair story with no build up or satisfying resolution. What remained was a "B" grade short story, making me very cautious to ever buy another abridgement. If you like Robin Cook, and want to hear this audio book, I strongly suggest you listen to the unabridged version. It most definitely has to be much better! 
 Will Bassett 4/13/06 	The Divine Comedy, written by Dante, begins with Dante, the main character, stumbling along a deserted path. But, and wolf  " was pushing [him] back, little by little, thither where the Sun is silent" (Dante 1). When it seems that Dante will be eaten by this wolf, a spirit Virgil, rescues him. Virgil tells Dante that he  "shalt see ancient spirits woeful who each proclaim the second death. And then thou shalt see those who are contented in the fire...then ascend, there shall be a soul more worthy than I [to show you heaven]"(Dante 2). Dante is simply told that it is the will of God and that this be done. So Virgil begins the tour with Hell. It is up to you to find out if he makes it through Hell and Purgatory to his ultimate goal: Heaven, where  the glory of Him that moves everything penetrates through the universe"(Dante 106). 	 This book, which takes place during the Middle Ages, does not fall into any genre, it is a religious fiction. Because it is fiction and one man's interpretation of the afterlife, readers should be careful not to misinterpret this as Catholic doctrine. Since this book was written around 700 years ago, the language can be hard to understand. Dante weaves such a web of words that it is extremely easy to get lost in it. However, this does add to the style of the book. Many people associate such elaborate descriptions to something as grand as Heaven or Hell, for that matter. I would not recommend reading this book though. Although the plot sounds good, it is too confusing to follow. Also, many people could misinterpret Dante's idea of the afterlife as Catholic teaching. Since some of the things mentioned by Dante, such as Limbo, are disregarded by the Catholic Church, it would not be good if someone would take it as Catholic belief 
 I like Mos Def's "Black on Both Sides" and the Black Star album, as well as some of his collabs with The Roots, Common, High & Mighty, ect...but this album is worthless.  It's all pop slow jams that are boring and mundane.  If you liked "UMI SAYS" from B.O.B.S. the most off that album, then this may be for you.  But for Hip Hop fans and Mos' fans this will most likely dissapoint.  The Rap-Rock doesn't fit his style, the love ballads get boring after the first 8 bars and everything else is just boring to me.  As a HIP HOP fan I can't recommend this album, but I do give him credit for having the cahonies to experiment 
 Had I read the reviews more critically, I would never have bought this book. From these reviews it is clear that Ms. Devi has popularized yoga, and in so doing, has trivialized yoga. Her earthy-crunchy, anecdotal babbling throughout the book makes this an excruciating read. I have never written a negative review of a book, but this book is an abomination 
 I purchased this item Jan 2006.  It has already quit recognizing any of the items plugged into it.  My USB printer went beserk when I plugged it in - never could get a page to print, so I direct connected into my laptop and all was fine. Now my camera dock and PDA are not recognized. I have contacted the warranty people via email - told me to call. Contacted Belkin and they gave me an RMA # to return the item 
 George Soros, one of the greatest speculators of all time wrote this book which is an ode to govenment and bureaucracy intervention. It seems at first sight that Soros realized that true liberalism (not the liberalism of the left wing in America) was wrong and thus the Estate should intervene to fix the market's problems.  Now you may be asking, How come a guy who made 1 billion dollars in one day thru speculation against the british pound in the 90's is now a critic of the system that let him speculate and get rich?. Well, Soros changed his mind about capitalism when he lost 2 billion dollars during the russian crisis. He tried to convince the World Bank and the IMF to save russian markets like they did in Mexico in 1995, but no help was approved.  So, what's the solution according to Soros? Easy: create new bureaucracy. He wants a Global Fed, Government intervention in the markets and a more robust and strong Estate. If this solution were to be implemented, Soros would be denying to others the opportunities he had to get rich. I think what Soros wants is to prevent others to compete with him perhaps because he is tired of today's competition.  If you are into Mises, Hayek or even Friedman, this book will only be useful to show the clichs that the left wing repeats over and over against capitalism. It doesn't add something new to the debate, just shows us that Soros is a great speculator but a poor economist 
 It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better 
 While I myself had not actually read the book, the problems I see with this work is tautologically apparent.  PIAS works on an objective, logical truth that far exceeds mankinds framed reference of what can be epistemically available.  Recent works have started to combine the gap between current science, and the emerging postmodernist methodologies to create a holistically balanced approach (I refer the reader to  Sokal 1996).  Our job as subjective viewers is to wait in the sidelines until the field codifies itself, but until then, reserve judgement.  
 Leland's attempt to document this history of the concept of hip in America is valient, but his thesis is fault at best. He tried to say that every chapter of the history of hip is related...and its not 
 Tabor does several twists and turns to arrive to the conclusion here, and pieces bits and pieces of a chain to support it.  One chain off and the whole thesis falls apart.  Claims: 1. Jesus wasn't God. 2. Jesus' father was not God OR Joseph. 3. Jesus' father was possibly a Roman soldier named Pantera. 4. Argues that James, the brother of Jesus and Paul were two conflicting versions of Christianity. 5. Paul's "Christianity" won out. 6. Believes on the hypothetical text (Q) being the source of the gospels (yet no archaeological evidence supports it).  And you guessed it, none of the claims have any evidence.  So for a FICTION work, this is great.  For a scholarly, historic work?  The Da Vinci Code was better. 
 Not really much to say, I have read all his other books, but by far his worst.  I'm not really into ghosts in subs, the rest of the plot was not too bad. But I have to agree with a previous reviewer, a billion dollar sub sent out on an exercise in a hurricane and his dead wife telling him what to do 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 The alternate title of this book should have been "HOW TO AFFECT AN AIR OF SOPHISTICATION AND URBANITY IN SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES OF PLODDING AND FRANKLY UNBELIEVABLE PLOTTING COUPLED WITH TWO DIMENSIONAL STEREOTYPES SO PREDICTABLE IN THEIR PRETENTIOUS MUSINGS".   An overly long title you might opine but surely not in light of the success of two such eloquent and verbose authors. I had hopes for these two having started with "Cabinet of Curiosities". Their subsequent offerings flagged sequentially but I retained hope for latent talent. Then this? This self-indulgent, conceited tome demonstrated a predisposition not unlike that so manifestly exhibited by the socially-upward-mobile.  I am so saddened to see that some of the most lauded exponents of modern popular fiction are the likes of Messrs. Preston and Child and perhaps the worst offender of all, Dan Brown 
 This cover works well with keeping leaves and such off of the trampoline; but every single time it rains, I have to spend an hour or so getting the standing water out from the middle!  It is a back breaking job and it is hard to understand why trampoline covers are not made to handle this correctly.  More damage is done to the trampoline with the heavy water sitting there than leaves and limbs falling on it! This is a worthless item 
 Like other reviewers, I found MeetThe Parents mildly amusing and this sequel was in the 3 for $25 bin at Hollywood so I figured "Why not?" Well here's why not. It presents the main character's parents as crude, clueless buffoons, and having no social judgement whatsoever, but it seems the writers want the audience to think of them as cool and hip. And for some odd reason they live in a house that resembles the castle on Fantasy Island. I'm surprised they didn't include a sex with a midget scene. Nobody would want their daughter to marry into this family let alone a right wing former CIA agent, who was set up as an object of ridicule. Oh, and they had to be Jewish too. Streisand and Hoffman should be ashamed of themselves portraying their own people in such an unflattering way. {"Our people don't shoot ducks, dear") Do former CIA agents make enough money to live in mansions and buy a custom built RV that would cost at least $250 k? The toilet humor and profanity wouldn't have made it into "Dumb and Dumber" Nothing reedeming or funny here. Fuhgeddaboutit 
 I thought I'd enjoy this humorous short story collection, but My Date with Satan read like an amateur comic routine at a comedy club.  The author tried too hard to be witty and clever at times and said attempts often backfired.  I rolled my eyes while I read this book more times than I care to remember.  The only story that I liked was "Rats Eat Cats."  That was the only story that had some earnest humor.  As an avid short-fiction reader, My Date with Satan lack the ingredients needed in this stuff genre to hook readers.  This book was not for me.. 
 Although this product is pretty to look at, one must remember not to bend it to fit as it will crack the silver plating and the bracelet will fall apart in your hands. I do not suggest buying this item as it is not solid sterling silver as you are lead to believe 
 It blew chunks. It made me so depressed that I spent the next few weeks throwing up in my bathroom 
 Which of the following statements are true:  a)	René Descartes invented the Cartesian coordinate system to track the movements of a fly on the wall.  b)	René Descartes was messy.  c)	René Descartes absentmindedly fell into the Seine.  d)	None of the above. The correct answer is "d)." Unfortunately, the author of this pseudo-biography, tells an engaging story, which incorporates all three statements. The fact behind the fiction is stated in the Author's Note section on the final page (48), where we learn the only two undisputable facts in the entire book: "...René Descartes made the Cartesian Coordinate System very popular. And he was a darn good philosopher, too." The remaining pages are filled with speculation. Although the illustrations are very good, and the book's explanation of the Cartesian coordinate system is comprehensible, it seems pointless to provide a fabricated story to a seven to nine-year-old child, to whom you must at some point say, "It isn't true." 
 You notice how this book does not have the "look inside the book" like most books on Amazon.com? Yet it's been out for years? This is intentional folks! If you look inside this book you will not want to buy it.   I was SO disapointed when I got this book. I loved the title, cover picture and it sounded like a great idea. Yet when I got it and opened it up it was the most boring and worst kids book I think I have ever come across. And most of the stuff in there is more related to the environment, not to vegetarianism.   I'm still smarting over losing my money on this one 
 The book covers only basic grammar;quite boring; doesn't make much sense. I would not recommand this book 
 Geisler stresses that we must have an objective test for the truth of a world-view. He posits the test of undeniability and unaffirmability. Namely, whatever is undeniable is true, and whatever is unaffirmable is false.   He then says that he'll show that every world-view except Theism is unaffirmable, and that Theism is the only affirmable and undeniable world-view.   Then Geisler discards the test in the very next chapter when he deals with Deism! He never shows how Deism is unaffirmable, but only that it's "inadequate" (p 171).   He criticizes Deism as inconsistent for believing that God doesn't intervene in the world by saying that once the Deist accepts Creation he must also accept the possibility of other miracles. Even if this is granted, this doesn't automatically mean that miracles happen! The possible does not equal the actual Mr. Geisler!  He also claims that "if God was concerned enough about man to create him, it would seem to follow that he would be concerned enough to intervene on his behalf." Thank you for your opinion Mr. Geisler, but why don't you show instead how the position is "unaffirmable" as you promised?   The first section of the book is worth the read but I give it 1 star because it completely failed to meet it's objective of showing all non-theisms unaffirmable and theism as undeniable.  
 This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history 
 Sorry Gary but this is not what I wanted.  A "how-to" book it's not.  This book skims over the industry and is mostly all "Gary" and his wonderful past.  Okay, I concede, he's had a excellent career and I'd enjoy reading his bio but I did not intend to get it out of this book!  I think Gary owes me a free VO session 
 I know that no book can cover every topic, but this book left a lot out. It went into great detail about what I should do if I got some pretty rare diseases, but barely touched on the subject of Morning sickness, which is much more common.  And some of the information was just plain wrong. I trashed the book when it made me freak out in the 20th week because I couldn't feel the baby move. It advised that I should call the doctor. When I did, I found out most women don't feel it move until 21 weeks. Unfortunately I found this out after I had cried my eyes out thinking something was wrong. I would not suggest this book to anyone 
 Liza Picard's book on mid-eighteenth century London is essentially for those who like to dip into a topic and have a short attention span. Though long, there is less to it than first meets the eye.  This is history-lite and as such would probably have found limited favour with Dr Johnson himself. Ms Picard has used some interesting material from medical sources of the day but her reliance on The Gentleman's Magazine as a source shows in the notes at the end of the book. There is little attempt to relate all this detail to the actual events of the times, so the reader is left with a far from balanced picture of what mid-eighteenth century London was really like 
 When this movie began, I was sure I was in for something penetrating and deep.  As it went on, I felt that the movie was merely clever.  Within a few minutes of that, I was just plain bored.    The premise -- Hitler, his colleagues, and a few random Nazis in a surreal, underground world akin to hell -- has potential.  But the movie becomes tedious for lack of any plot, or of any pretense of one.  The whole movie is given over to listening to Hitler make speeches about heroism, propaganda, and other abstract concepts.  For the sake of variety, his speechifying is occasionally interrupted by comments from Goebbels, Goering, Eva Braun, and others.    Having Hitler talk with Sigmund Freud was evidently intended to be the cleverest stroke of all.  Freud, however, is portrayed as a bland, ordinary, TV-stereotype of a psychologist; the only way we know he's supposed to be Freud is the beard and the pince-nez.    
 If you want a quick intro to Adam Smith, read the chapter on him in Heilbroner's "Wordly Philosophers," or read "How the Scots Invented the Modern World" to understand the context of his contribution.  There are also several larger competent discussions of Smith's books.  This book is a waste of time.  It has the usual Smith quotes and some unfamiliar ones too, and the discussion is sometimes helpful, but O'Rourke's attempts at humor range from cutesy to irrelevant to obnoxious.  Smith has aged well, O'Rourke has not.  At several points O'Rourke simply dismisses important elements of mainstream economic theory as confusing.  I thought a short book about Smith with his juicy quotes and some intelligent discussion of contemporary issues that prove his points couldn't possibly miss, but this one missed big time.  O'Rourke himself admits he's a sad imitation of Mencken.  If you want funny, read Mencken.  I hardly ever take books back for refund, but I'm asking for a refund on this one 
 For a thorough understanding of the Mid-East and the Bible, read "Whose Land? Whose Promise?" by Gary Burge, PhD, professor of New Testament at Wheaton College.  Forget the hype and disinformation and find out the facts 
 Wendy Doniger has done a disservice to an important Hindu work. She has misinterpreted the work in important passages.   Poor showing Wendy 
 The shabby, peeling paint trend is dead. None of my design clients want it anymore. This book is a relic of the past and should be allowed to die a dignified death. I challenge Rachel Ashwell to come up with something newer, more fun, and less depressing 
 Before taking a 4 hour train trip, I surveyed the pulp novels available at the news-stand.  I didn't want to make the mistake of picking up another book I would have to throw away in disgust 3 days later, like "Nightmares and Dreamscapes" or anything by that man-hating forensic anthropologist, what's-her-name.  So I went with "Bourne Ultimatum" as a safe bet, figuring, since I had seen "Identity" and "Supremacy" in the movie incarnations, and they were pretty good, this would be more of the same.    I was very wrong.  From the first few chapters, it became clear that the book was incoherent, repetitive, and its characters were laughably underdeveloped.  Later, huge holes in the plot began to appear, apparent lapses in reason and knowledge on the part of the author regarding their own material.  These seem to haunt many pulp novels, but nowhere is it more annoying.  Also, the author has the lazy habit of putting a lot of dialogue in italics to show emotion, rather than writing emotional dialogue.    This book has become almost unreadable, so it's going to the curb tomorrow.  I'm quitting on page 263.  I don't like or feel attached to any of the characters, and the plot has become a confusing spiral of contrivances.  I agree with the other reviewers who have stated that this book is a real slog to read; the opposite of a page-turner.  It's sad to see a trilogy that apparently started well, end like this.  You can guess from reading it that Ludlum, if he even wrote it, had no interest in the material, but had a contract to fulfill.              
 I was rather diappointed in this collection.  A few of the poems are very nice, but overall the work is bland and dull.  The language is so pedestrian.  This seems like a real half-hearted attempt at writing.  I am  sure Walker can do better 
 The expectations for this film were high- a good cast and a promise of a remake of an old movie using today's technology.  Alas- the movie was disappointing. The characters were not developed and the were quite flat.  The action starts very soon in the movie (the wave striking the ship) and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop.  The course of the movie did not allow for any significant development. Moreover, the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable. For example all the surviving passangers, including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period.  It is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable. 
 The sizing in this book is a joke.  As noted in another review, the largest finished size is a 46" bust, which I would describe as, at most, an XL.  Perhaps they are using extended misses sizes instead of women's (plus) sizing. The styles are also uninspired, frumpy and shapeless.  This book was a big disappointment and demostrates again how little the knitwear and fashion industry knows or cares about the needs of plus size women 
 Great coffee, and a convenient size, but the carafes keep breaking on me! I used the original carafe just a few times before it broke. I ordered a replacement, and was extra careful when handling it (especially when washing it). I used the carafe maybe five times before it broke. These things just seem to spontaneously combust. The carafes are $12 a piece, so it's not worth replacing again. ARGH 
 some of the stories were good enough in this collection, but most were too boring too catch your attention (too obvious, boring descriptions, weak plot etc.). i guess you have to be into the old charm of the english ghost story to really appreciate this. i guess i am too modern to be scared by a guy who talks to a guy who turns out to be a ghost, and that's it 
 Zack comes up with really dynamic concepts for books.  I wish her career well.  However, I wasn't thrilled by this book.  Zack edits an anthology on "microdiversity", basically investigating the fac that there is more diversity within races than between races and mixed-race individuals substantiate this.  Zack basically goes back and forth on whether racial categories should be used strategically or obliterated.  The anthology has some interesting pieces from Native Americans.  It is lacking on pieces from Latinos.  It is very academic: everyday fans of Maria Root's books may be stumped here.  The book ends with this awkard, unnecessary essay by a Jewish woman that is not even bi-religious.  This book isn't terrible, it's just that there are better books on multiraciality out there 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 My first Patricia Cornwell book.  Now, it's my last Patricia Cornwell book.  I finished it only because I had invested time in it.  No suspense, no intrigue.  Character interaction is silly.  Somehow, it never seems to bother Lucy that her aunt (Dr Scarpetta) keeps showing up at her apartment, office and field job because she's "worried about her".    For an FBI again, Lucy's got no stones.  I should have read the reviews here prior to reading this rag 
 The Institute for Creation Research promotes Scientific Creationism (SC) as a textbook for high school and college students, and many reviewers were impressed by the "scientific facts" in SC. But how scientific is it, really?    I estimate the number of quotes in the book at about 400 in the "science" section of the book, and about 400 more Bible references in the last part of the book. What kind of bizarre science textbook has that many quotes OR that many Bible references???     Furthermore, Morris and others at the Institute for Creation Research have a very unsavory reputation for dishonesty, including distorting quotes, so any book he writes that contains so many quotes is especially suspect.    Some specific problems:    Chapter 1: Evolution or Creationism?   Morris said all monotheistic faiths are inherently creationist.  Wrong!  Christianity is a monotheistic faith, and millions of Christians are evolutionists!    Morris also said atheism is inherently evolutionist.  That's wrong too.  Raelians are atheists.  They are also anti-evolutionist.     Morris relies very heavily on ad hominem arguments.  For example he said the Nazis were evolutionists.  Not only are ad hominem arguments illogical, but in this case, they are also factually wrong.  Hitler's "Mein Kampf" is clearly creationist, some of Hitler's racist beliefs are echoed in Morris's own statements, and Hitler's racism is echoed by other creationism-supporting groups, such as the KKK.    Chapter 2: Chaos or Cosmos?   Morris said stars have never changed for as long as man has been observing them.  Wrong!  Numerous supernovae have been observed throughout history.   Chapter 3: Thermodynamics.   Morris claims the second law of thermodynamics makes ALL increases in order impossible, which allegedly makes evolution impossible.  But Morris himself describes systems where increases in order ARE possible: seeds growing into trees and fetuses growing into babies.  Interestingly, all of Morris' "exceptions" involve biological organisms, so Morris' own examples indicate that increases in order ARE possible in biology, DESPITE the second law.   Morris says not one new species is known to have evolved during recorded history.  Wrong!  Some web sites list hundreds of them.  Even Morris' colleague, Duane Gish, indicates that over 25,000 new worm species could have evolved from a single pair following Noah's Flood.  That's a lot of "impossible" evolution!  Chapter 4: Accident or Purpose?   Morris said in Chapter 2 that statistics are ALWAYS invalid in analyzing one-time events, but in this chapter Morris calculates the probability of life evolving, something Morris himself says was a one-time event.  Apparently he's too clueless to see the inconsistency there.    Morris bases ALL his statistics on the assumption that only one combination of genes, proteins, etc., will work.  Wrong!  There's 6 billion people and billions of other organisms on the planet right now, all of them with unique combinations of genes, proteins, etc.  For Morris to ASSUME that only one set of genes will work is simply stupid and completely invalidates his statistical arguments.   Morris says ALL life forms appeared simultaneously in the Cambrian, but then lists fourteen groups that started hundreds of millions of years earlier or later, including insects, flowering plants, and trilobites.  Apparently he's too clueless to see the inconsistency.  Morris' most RECENT citation on transitional forms of plants is 1951.  Unbelievable.   Chapter 5: Uniformitarianism.   Morris says rocks are dated SOLELY by their fossil content.  Wrong!  Moon rocks and meteorites don't contain ANY fossils; and in ancient rocks, the rocks themselves are not dated, rather it is their minerals that are dated, and minerals don't contain ANY fossils either.  What a dunce.   Morris repeatedly refers to fossil graveyards containing hundreds of billions of fossils caught in Noah's Flood. ALL those fossilized animals lived at the same time, according to Morris, and that's simply impossible.  For example, according to Morris, oil is the converted remains of billions of marine animals caught in Noah's Flood.  Since it takes 880 million tons of organic remains to make 1.1 billion barrels of oil, the known oil reserves in the world today (not even counting oil already taken out!) would indicate that TRILLIONS of tons of invertebrates were ALL living at the SAME time and in the SAME few places!  Impossible!    Morris says hydrodynamic sorting sorted rocks by size and weight during Noah's Flood, but he describes a huge blanket of heavy conglomerates that ended up HIGHER than much lighter sandstones and silts.  How'd that happen???  Morris's "scientific theory" violates the law of gravity!  According to Morris, Noah's Flood was so powerful that entire mountains were washed away, the fountains of the deep exploded world-wide, and the continents were blasted apart a distance of 2,000 miles or more.  But Morris relies on "ecological zonation" to explain fossil sequences.  Ecological zonation implies that that little minnows, frogs, lizards, mice, and rabbits all remained undisturbed in their ecological niches despite the Flood.  So entire mountains were washed away, but minnows, turtles, and rabbits remained in place???  Unbelievable.  The Paluxy "man-tracks" allegedly overlapping dinosaur tracks are described as "conclusive" "known" proof that dinosaurs lived at the same time as men, even though the ICR acknowledged twice in 1986 that the "man-tracks" had been debunked (i.e., they weren't actually human tracks).  Morris also tells his readers to watch a video documentary on the subject, even though the film was withdrawn from distribution following the tracks' debunking.  One lie on top of another, still being promoted as true today.  Chapter 6: Old or Young?   Speaking of old, the quotes in this section are badly out-dated, often from the 40's and 50's, when radiometric dating was in its infancy. For these ancient quotes to be used fifty years later in a "modern" textbook is simply shameful, a perfect example of Morris' dishonesty in using quotes to mislead people.  If a stock promoter used such tactics, he'd be prosecuted for securities fraud.  Out of 9 citations on the evolution of man, 8 were from 1973 or earlier, and one of them was from Reader's Digest!  Unbelievable!  This "science textbook" is pathetic 
 Wow. This story is full of characters who I think were supposed to by sympathetic. . . Before I was even a third of the way through, I was hoping it would end with some sort of catastrophic event that killed every character in a terrible, horrific, painful manner.   The author managed to take a pretty interesting idea - rewriting the genetic code of a man using DNA thought to be from Christ - and made it dull and very predictable. The mosr amazing feat is that at the same time, he manged to write several characters who were all in need of a .45 cranial injection. The only character I dind't want dead soon into the book was Freddy. I liked him.   A very disappointing book, which is a shame, since it shouldn't have been. The base idea was interesting, and worthy of exploration, but the author didn't have the courage to see it through, and instead decided to go with old, worn-out plot twists that anyone could see coming from a mile away. 
 I've read many books on PKI and there are not many good ones out there.  This one used to be the best among some very awful books, which wasn't saying much.  It was excellent on covering the standards of PKI such as they exist, but otherwise said very little about installation, layout, protocols, and design, common problems, and real world solutions.  Most of what they said was repeated multiple times throughout the book.  Sometimes even on the very next paragraph.  They took two/three pages just to say that the top down approach to PKI planning is better than slapping in a service just to support a single product.  Stating the obvious didn't win any points with me.  They discussed outdated or barely used protocols like SET, and didn't bother getting in depth at all with protocols that are in use like SSL.  They discussed Single Sign On like a simple PKI install will solve all our problems, completely missing the outstanding problem of vendor interoperability.  Active Directory and PKI are only mentioned in passing with no operational details.  Get Klaus Schmeh's book or the Housley book instead 
 Have owned several WD external drives with no problems this one would not work...on the PC on the MAC etc.   The package arrived quick enough...The internal packing list is so sanitized you dont know who or where to return the item to. The return is AGONIZING! came from BEACH Audio ...AVIOD THESE GUYS! Getting a return authorization number is a nightmare!@ Multiple e-mails and calls to them...ugggghhhhhh!  Much better off getting from the MAC store! BUYER BEWARE!  I totally expect NOT to get my refund! 
 Like so many bad, bad movies, this book is a beautiful production.  It features slick, heavy paper; a million color pictures; attractive, readable typeface; witty contributors.  Its proportions seem just right for its weight.  But unless you just love grazing on hors d'oeuvres (and many do), you're likely to be disappointed by this beautiful but cynical exercise in marketing to the culturally insecure.  As somebody has already noted: No Iliad.  No Odyssey. No Aeschylus. No Euripides. No Boccaccio. No Chaucer. No Dante.  No Machiavelli. No Shakespeare. No Marlowe.   No Old or New Testament. No Q'uran. No Lao-tse, Confucius, Bhagavda-Gita (really short and really good). No Beowulf. No Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.  In fact, only 13 works from before 1700 make the cut - and lest you think fun is the criterion, one of them is John Lyly's Euphues long regarded as one of the most unreadable and, shall we say, "affected" works in English literature. You get John Lyly instead of John Milton.     On the other hand, you do get 69 titles of books that have appeared since 2000.  That's a lot of "classics" in record time.  How did they pick these?  And there's another 700 - out of 1001, if you can dig it, "you must read before you die" written in the 20th Century.  The 19th Century is well represented, I'll grant. Huck Finn is here - but not Twain's more complicated Letters from the Earth, The Mysterious Stranger, A Connecticut Yankee, or Pudd'nhead Wilson.    They also felt it necessary to fill out the list with a few short stories like Lovecraft's "The Mountains of Madness" and Gogol's "The Nose."  Great stories, but two actual books had to go to make room for them.  Books like The Red Badge of Courage, for example.    Or maybe The Red Badge got crowded out by Justine or American Psycho.  This is a book for people who like to read about books in snappy reviews, and look at color pictures of books. You'll find some titles worth pursuing, but you could do better, for starters, just by getting a list of Cliff's Notes titles and going on from there.   You can do that for free 
 This book is akin to a fashion magazine.  There are lots of great pictures, and interesting celebrity "sex goddess" profiles, but you won't gain anything significant by reading this.  The "sex tips" are bland and very typical -- nothing new to be learned here.  There's not much else to say about this book.  It didn't teach me anything I didn't already know, and I'm not sure why I bothered to waste money and time on it.  
 After seeing, and enjoying the film "The Magdalen Sisters" I wanted to find more factual information about the subject. This was the only book available.  I was, unfortunately, VERY disappointed. The book is poorly written; the author jumping from one subject to another rather than following any logical pattern.  She looks at not only the Magdalen Asylums in Ireland (as the title implies)but 'rescue homes' for prostitutes run by a variety of organizations, and located in both Ireland and England. The main focus of the book (such as it is) is on early to mid-19th century institutions. At that time the asylums and homes were used almost exclusively by prostitutes, and attendence was purely voluntary. (The author notes that most women left after only a few months, unwilling or unable to cope with the strict rules.) The book barely touches on the more recent history of the asylums. (It was mostly in the mid-to-late 20th century that they were inhabited primarily by unwed mothers. 
 I fail to understand all of the hoopla about Susan Sontag. While I have only read a limited selection of her work, in these essays, "Against Interpretation" being the ultimate example, Sontag emerges as a simple-minded, arrogant ignoramus. In her utterly unreasoned invective,  Sontag ignores (or is just unable to understand) two critical facts. First,  some works of art and theory are difficult to understand (in varying  degrees) without the help of interpretation. Sontag's flawed analysis of  the supposed ruination of the works of Kafka by interpretation demonstrates  that not only is she among this crowd, she has clearly reached new and  unheard of misguided heights. Second, Sontag ignores the fact that works of  art in other languages cannot be understood in translation without the help  of interpretation and criticism that demonstrates the extent to which  aspects of a certain culture are imbedded in the original language. This  couldn't possibly be clearer than in poetry. Weinberger's excellent  "Nineteen Ways of Looking at Wang Wei", which adroitly considers  the subject, hadn't been released when Sontag published this essay but it  probably wouldn't have made a difference. What was she thinking? The only  good aspect of the essay (and why I give it 2 stars instead of 1 or zero)  is the fact that it has given me ample opportunity to win arguments against  individuals who are flawed in their thinking enough to enjoy Sontag's  writing 
 I absolutely loved the Perfect Pregnancy Workout by Karyne....just couldn't get into this one.  I started doing this video when my baby was about a month old.  I had worked out with her Perfect Pregnancy Workout up until a couple of weeks before the birth of my son.    I personally found the exercises not challenging enough and awkward...maybe I was looking for doing too much too soon?!  Just was not as impressed with this video.  I found myself going through the entire video to feel like I had exercised.  I did the workout half a dozen times and then went to the library and got a Denise Austin video.  Sorry...it just wasn't as good as the pregnancy video.    Her Prefect Pregnancy Workout is definately worth it, not this one though 
 I would like to delete about half of the truly unfamiliar tracks and possibly add a couple of better known more familiar works 
 It is not good as  a mainstream movie , it does not have a good plot , some scenes are not relevant . Even as a soft-porn movie, it does not do a good job. Try watching "I like to play games" , its a much better soft-porn movie.  
 So many managers read the 1-1 rubbish and wasted millions on CRM systems that were ill conceived and poorly managed.  And now the same people take their old 1-1 idea and add customer lifetime value (LTV).   While there's no arguing that LTV is important, the authors do not illuminate how it works or why it's important.  The book could have delivered its message in a 5 page article.  A real problem, and a practical one "where do these numbers come from" is left unanswered.  It's frustrating and disappointing that the Peppers & Rogers buzz-marketing machine has deflected so much attention to themselves and away from better books on similar topics.  Suggested reading: - Customer Equity (Blattberg) - Marketing and the Bottom Line (ISBN: 0273661949) - Marketing Payback (ISBN: 0273688847 
 I had this blender for 3-4 years and was very unhappy with it. The design is poor (liquids tend to dribble terribly when poured), the motor seems weak, and it is hard to clean. Food seems to get under the metal band around the top and is not reachable. Today, after only sporadic, medium-duty use over the few years I had it, my blender outright died.  I have other Cuisinart products that perform very well, but this blender is a loser 
 I am a huge fan of BTNH, but even I will admitt this is not a good album. The worst being "Home" which uses samples from Phil Collins. The whole thing feels kind of empty, with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works. There are a few songs worth listening to. Most notably is "Clevland is the City" which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any "harmony" to it. Other songs worth mentioning are "What About Us", "Not my baby" and "Pump,Pump",the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage. It is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released 
 I am conservative on most issues but I do have some problems with our strategies in the Iraq war.  I have a very liberal friend who is in love with the term "Neocon".  He is constantly critizing me for reading "right wing" propaganda so I said I would give his idea of a great book a try.  I read a little over half of the book and I couldn't take it anymore.  I found myself dreading getting back to the book each day, to me this is just a liberal antiwar hit piece.  There are some good questions in the book on our strategies and troop deployment.  But the author's hate of Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and Rice take over and cloud every chapter.  He makes the Neocons sound like Dr. Evil's Chamber in the Austin Powers movies.  His referencing was always from the far left blogs and publications, he constantly referenced conversations that could never be substantiated.  My friend told me this was a historical book, apolitical, I think not.  Read it if you want to, I couldn't get through it.  Ann Coulter is an idealogue, but at least she is funny 
 I made a poor decision based on a few good reviews when I decided to purchase these.  I should have listened to the multiple bad reviews.  Lint...lint....lint....lint....EVERYWHERE!  I made the mistake of washing my green, blue and maroon sheet sets together........HUGE MISTAKE!  The colors bled all over each other in the wash.  Then to make matters the colored lint totally overtook my dryer. It was a mess.  But I was determined to get at least one wear out of this useless mess and so I placed them on my son's bed as well as my own.  The pilling NEVER stops!  Just like others reported the lint was all in our hair, on our clothes and some even flaked all over the floor.  On the positive note, I purchased the pink set as well.  It was not as bad as the darker colors--as far as not bleeding and having lint everywhere. So I was able to enjoy the softness and warmth these sets offer.  So trying again...... I decided to wash each of the darker colored sheet sets separately....as I still got the same results.  So I tossed them.  They are not even good for scraps because of the constant pilling. What a waste!  Please believe if you want softness and warmth that badly you are better off cuddling with a pet who sheds it's coat in the spring...at least it would be less messy 
 This man is like Michael Bay.  Using high speed action sequences and terrible casting and script writing, the fact that Chris Tucker appears in this and almost every movie that the man makes signals a trend to do these as not so much movies as they are music video comedys only it's patheic and not funny, and that is also why the man who is now making X-Men 3 will cause that movie franchise to die a quick death at the movies.  The man is a joke 
 You must know by now, the prize for determining longitude at sea prior to satalites, etc. A race between the sextant types (astronomy) and the creation of a clock that does not lose time at sea(now available at all malls). If your interest lies with navigation, as does mine, this isn't your book.  If your interest lies in the historic quest for the perfect clock, even though the author doesn't really go into why and how this clock is such so superior to others (ie the engineering), then this book is for you 
 This book is alright if youd like to hear about what scientist rushed into the other ones office screaming. Or the life of Dr. Planck, and three hours later find out what the planck length is and what it,s used for. i personally want the facts and the information about the interesting subject that they use as their title. Not the history of why a world class scientist killed himself. To sum up it's a great book if you want a biography with the interesting stuff strewn about in many places so you have to search. although if you like a historical book then you may find it interesting 
 This carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached.  The fabric is very cheap, and it melted in the dryer.  I wash my carseats after every roadtrip, and it didn't even last one roadtrip before melting.  It ripped the day that I got it trying to adjust the straps.  I was very disappointed in this carseat.  I would not purchase it again.  I loved my previous carseats being the Alpha Omega, and a Graco.  If you are looking for something cheap this is the product. There are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured.  Try those ones first.  This is an awful carseat. 
 I couldn't get into this book. I got maybe 30 pages and quit because I can't stand the main character's sense of humor. It may be called "gritty" or "edgy" but I think that it's immature and twisted. 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 I was anticipating loving this book.  I am an Irish Catholic, from Boston, and a fan of the Kennedy legacy.  Forever Young does not tell you anything new.  The author is a megalomaniac and it comes through loud and clear in his writing.  He credits his father and himself for many things that occur in JFK's and JFK Jr.'s lives.  Another reviewer wrote how they were appalled about the way William Noonan treated his mother.  I could not agree more.  This review seems to be more about the author than the book about JFK Jr.  That seems fitting, since the book is really more about Billy Noonan than the person you are interested in learning more about, JFK Jr 
 I really am a big W. J. Williams fan, but this book was a major dissapointment.  I hope the sequel to this poor work shows some of the old Williams' style.  The concept of Plasma as the means to power in this world is UNrealized. Constantine is a particularly UNimpressive hero in an UNhappy world of petty power mongers struggling UNmightily to conquer only each other while the rest of the planet watches UNinterestedly. You will also read without interest.  A lot of UNs is the best way to summarize this  UNmemorable work from a writer who used to produce compelling plots and characters that meant somthing to the reader. The female protagonist follows Williams' now common formula of the person who acts primarily in their own self interest until they reach the moment when they are forced to choose between themselves and someone they love. Mr. Williams' work has not been crisp lately, read the excellent Voice Of The Whirlwind for a glimpse of Williams at his most powerfu 
 I realized this book was written YEARS ago after I received it. With medical science making such progress. I have to wonder how correct the book is now.I have a dog, Muffin that has cancer and I am desperately trying to save her.  
 This was my first experience with Stephen King and I made it to page 150 before I quit.  It was agonizingly slow and it just wasn't my cup of tea.  I told myself that I would quit at page 100 if it didn't seem to go somewhere but I gave it another 50 pages because it was Stephen King.  It was brutal 
 Wuthering Heights the novel grabs you at the first page and drags you through passion, betrayal, madness, despair, greed, hatred, and revenge. It's not necessarily a pleasant read, but always an engrossing one. Emily Bronte's characters jump off the page and will continue to haunt you long after you've finished the book.   Modern day moviemakers have had a notoriously bad time translating any of the Bronte sisters' works into film and this is no exception. The characters are representations in name only and fail to capture any of the true spirit behind this amazing book. Juliet Binoche and Ralph Fiennes are two of the best actors working in film today, but this movie is a definite low point for both.    As Heathcliff and Catherine, Fiennes and Binoche seem to have failed to grasp the depth or the passions of the characters and their performances are flat and bland. Binoche's personality is too grounded and mature for the wild and carefree Cathy so she compensates with endless giggling that got on my nerves. Fiennes comes across as greasy and sullen instead of a tormented and complex soul; he simply does not have the charisma or the depth to play such a demanding role. The other characters are likewise lacking in realism, only Janet McTeer fares well, she is fabulous as Ellen Dean.   Even if the acting were better, the story does not capture the essence of the book. Everything moves too quickly, the film jumps around frequently and large plot holes are left either unexplained or are patched quickly with a few brusque words. Sinead O'Conner's appearance as Emily Bronte to bookend the film is contrived and unnecessary.  This film was very obviously made on a budget and the sets and costumes show it. The wigs are dreadful and the costumes are for the most part, ugly and unflattering. Fiennes actually looks potbellied in some of his vests!   Maybe someday someone will make a film that does this remarkable book justice. This isn't it 
 Clearly pretentious (read the introduction and you'll discover that the author writes that the "academy members are primarily craftspeople who don't possess the critical faculties and scholarly approach of cinephiles ..." hummmm), this guy -who pretends to be a cinephile- has preferred to write here a total personal statement, mainly leftist (but sometimes you wonder...), and clearly mean, against the Oscar ceremony,and the people who vote for them and, those who receive the little golden boy(see in example how he prefers to quote only the bad reviews and not one good concerning Braveheart, which made, by the way, a confortable $210,409,945) rather than giving the reader an objective work, written with distance and elegance. Maybe he has never been able to enter the industry he seems to hate so much, and instead of getting an Oscar, prefers to spend time criticizing it with his typing machine, forgetting how much it's easier than... winning an Oscar or doing a movie. (getting one star for the paper and the ink 
 It's great that Dr. Weil recommends that we get fresh air, exercise, eat lots of vegetables, avoid fast food hamburgers,  breathe and think positive healing thoughts.  But that's the extent of his good advice.  He also gives some very bad advice that is effectively shredded in 2 new books that have come out.  "The Whole Soy Story" by Kaayla Daniel and "The Fluoride Deception" by Chris Bryson.  Between soy and fluoride you'll have a wiped out thyroid in 8 weeks (+ or -) and that doesn't bring optimum health.      
 The only reason to buy this book is to get a evaluation copy of Exchange Server 2003 software. I had Chapter 14 lessons 4 & 5 missing from the book 
 This poorly bound, poorly written book is practically stealing from people who buy it.  It is a pre-fab mess.  There is very little information that pertains to the business.  Avoid it 
 If you want your child to know the true & Bibical account of Jesus' birth...the shepherds came first! An angel announced His birth the shepherds hurried to see Mary, Joseph & baby Jesus. They were first on the scene. Some chronicle the kings coming as much as three years later. I will return my three sets & order the one with the bells & whistles AND two shepherds!! 
 Susanna Rowson's "Charlotte Temple" is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman. Poor, pitiful Charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin.          Rowson encases her heroine Charlotte Temple within a world of virtue and vengeance. Charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author/narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman. She has no real interest in Charlotte as a dimensional character. Charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings.           "Charlotte Temple" was written in 1794 and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed America. A morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now "Charlotte Temple" has been rediscovered and published in a Scholarly Press edition.          Was this reclamation of Charlotte really necessary? In the past twenty years, feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati. Authors such as Anne Plumptre, Frances Burney, Aphra Behn, Sarah Fielding and Charlotte Lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives. Feminist scholar Cathy Davidson has taken Charlotte Temple in hand and aims to join Rowson to the above list of rediscoveries.          Unfortunately, Rowson does not warrant such treatment. Rowson has a flat, humorless approach to the fallen woman story. Unlike Burney's "Evelina" or "Camilla," Rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity.  Her pedantic iron-fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates.           In many of the fallen women stories, authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures. Rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel. She seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man -- in England and America, it was not considered altogether lady-like to read a novel, so Rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed.          Rowson does not criticize men within the novel. She does not censure Montraville for taking Charlotte as his mistress, impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman. When he believes that Charlotte has becomes his best friend's mistress, he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him.          He aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting "dishonorable" against her. Yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her, she would not have been reduced to a penniless, pregnant ex-mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter. He never takes responsibility for his role in Charlotte's downfall.  Rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with Montraville but she fails to take it.           Instead, Rowson places the blame for Charlotte's ruin on the women within the novel. When Charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family, she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men.          Madame Du Pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose Miss La Rue. Madame Du Pont sets Charlotte's downfall in action. Rowson does not punish the ignorant Madame Du Pont by killing her, she ends up an hysterical mess after the Montraville/Charlotte "elopement."          Miss La Rue, the woman who pushes Charlotte into the arms of Montraville, must be punished for being a promiscuous woman. She ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food. She ends up dying painfully as Rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women.          Why would modern readers want to read this? I do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel. At 125 pages, it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace. No character has any shadings. There are no subplots to divert the attention from the static Charlotte. Rowson does nothing to keep our interest.          Unfortunately Rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first American woman to have a best-selling novel. That accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia, but it does not make for engaging reading 
 The book has an attractive cover and is well-marketed.  Beyond that, it's not worth the investment of time nor money.  The well-meaning author writes in a folksy narrative, with flagrant grammar flaws and overuses exclamation marks.  The organization and chronology are likewise poor.  Worse yet, substantively, the book reaches far and states assumptions which are not Biblically  sound.  Unfortunately, the author is not clear to point out those incidences when he may be speculating versus citing fact, which makes for some unsound theology.  Read the Biblical book of Esther and see how vastly different it is from this book.  This read is heavy on extras and tangents that are irrelevant to the theme 
 When I heard they re-made the classic 74 version I was real pumped to get to see a new take on it. That means that maybe they would delve deeper into the family in general. Like the hitchiker and cook from the original and how they along with Leatherface got into the whole killing business.   But this version has a really lame and uninteresting family. A cursing sherriff, legless old man, extremely obese woman, and an awful acting job by Leatherface himself ruined it for me. This family doesnt scare me at all, I would much rather have the old family back.  The casting of the main stars also was a bad move. How can anyone relate to a Seventh Heaven star? When we see her everyday on tv, its hard to imagine anything but her, meaning you see Jessica Beil and not Erin. The rest of the acting is also average at best.  I didnt want a scene-for-scene remake but I also didnt want a totally different movie. Why not just call this Chainsaw Massacre 5 or something? That wouldve been more honest. As a sequel this would have been better. I wanted to see a whole new take on the original, seeing different actors play the same characters from the original and at least the same plot.  I guarantee this movie wouldnt have done so well if it was a sequel. So the big wigs decided to call it a re-make. Another bad thing was the cinematography, why do new movies have to have the camera like an inch away from the actors face all of the time? Also during action scenes the camera has to shake wildely, and during kill scenes the camera is also right on top of the action, making it difficult to even tell what is going on 
 Granted, Erikson's book makes for a great read, but lacks any real credibility. This book, along with his book on Gandhi, demonstrate that one can read anything into people when seperated by time and space. Take  everything you read with a grain of salt. There are many more Luther bios  that are more accurate and useful 
 Modern creation theories are proving that an infinite God is the origination of our finite universe.  The consequence is that there is no celestial world.  Instead, God empowers and enlightens our world directly through a holistic spiritual atomic system.  Some of these atoms are human mind/souls.  Since the creation only contains wholes, mind/souls-bodies relations are never lost, making reincarnation a natural process.  So, channelling and paranormal sources must be questioned. 
 Reason once had two things going for it. It articulated principled libertarianism, and it was a consistently interesting magazine. Now its ideology is fuzzy; certainly not consistently libertarian. It is also dull and aimless, often badly written. Case in point: the current issue as I write includes a defense of the FDA by a writer who publically attacks prominent libertarians, and who works for an organization that supports a prohibition on the sale of nutritional supplements, as well as promoting state assaults on the tobacco industry. The "old" Reason would never have published such a piece.  Nor would Reason have previously published Ronald Bailey's article advocating mandatory health insurance. Bailey also supports the Iraq war and psychiatric coercion. A bright spot continues to be the writing of Jacob Sullum 
 This video is a collection of interviews with minor characters in Tupac's life. Tupac never shows up in it! What they had to say about the performer could have been condensed into a 10 minute production--if that. Your money is much better spent buying the Tupac Resurrection video, which is really very good and actually has Tupac giving the interviews 
 After enjoying his first book, Term Sheets and Valuations, I was looking forward to this one.  I regret to say that I found it a big waste of time and a bigger waste of money.    It appears as if the marketing of the book by the pblisher sought to take advantage of his first book by raising the price by 500%, giving the impression that this book was better or more comprehensive.  However, nothing could be further from the truth.  
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 The animation in this movie is an improvement over the televised series, the voice talent is good, the plot is solid-and I hate this movie. I cannot tolerate the body fluid/noise humor, the screaming and squalling of the kids, and the mamby pamby parents. But my daughter cannot get enough of this. She watches it at least once a week, and it never fails to delight her. 
 Let's see. Ken Starr wastes the public money attacking Bill Clinton with false accusations while at the same time siding with KON-servative Mitch Mcconnel of KY to allow for more corrupt campaigns as if there aren't any already !!! This book is a perfect tool for neconservative NAZIS to enjoy and drool over but is otherwise useless trash for the rest of us who are already facing mass destruction by Bush/Cheney/Rove/Delay and GOP with of course a spineless opposition that barely got together to defend Clinton but easily caved into and defended Bush the liar-in-chief ! 
 Give me a break.  MIchael Drosnin has written the worst book of the new century.  Actually think about what everybody is saying because there is nboway that these codes can even be valid.  Nuff Said.  I have done my work, read all the other reviews (including Kazuo, ahem).  gift?  WHo tags this piece of _____ with gift 
 My wife and I have now spent a good month "learning" with this book. In fact more than 10 minutes a day,  more like 30 minutes per session. We both speak other languages, so we can compare.  GOOD, nice thematic picture groups,  and you need to learn the words associated with them.  (We did.)  BAD, again, and again Ms. Kershul introduces words,  and grammar which do not fit into the "just mastered"  scheme of things.  IRRITATING to the extreme: Ms. Kershul gives her instructions in a mixture of English  and Italian in one sentence.  (We would have preferred one line of Italian ONLY,  followed by one line --say in italics--  providing the English translation, in many cases preferably, with an explanations "how this compares to what was done yesterday".)  BAD: In attempt to NOT introduce grammar, you are left high  and dry figuring out gender, declinations, and worse conjugations by yourself.  (We have not yet seen satisfactory forms summarizing 'things',  and we are half way through the book).  In anger, we finally went to the local library  and got a 70 years old Italian grammar for High Schools.  That did solve our problem and left us convinced that "new and improved" does not necessarily  provide a better learning experience.  Somewhat IRRITATING:  Ms Kershuls's choice of vocabulary seems to assume that 1. you wish to visit lots of relatives  (not an uncle, niece, grandson, cousin, grandparent, or daughter  is forgotten in the family tree),  2. you wish to order meals and "buy stuff" constantly (we assure you, that is the one thing Italians are very good at, understanding English when you want to  buy things or order a meal)  3. you wish to tell Italians that you are "American"  (as if our accents and clothing are not dead-give-aways)  4. you pray "catholic", "protestant", or "Hebrew".  (the Italians we know couldn't care less -- how about instead "politics", "music", "movies", "soccer"  and the "bella ragazza" over there)  In summary, we are ready now to look for a book which does not claim to be "easy, in 10 minutes a day",  but emphasizes grammar,  groups vocabulary (and discusses alternatives for each new word),   provides clearer indication of emphasis in the pronounciation (example: telEfono, versus incorrect tElefono) Teaches Italian as a language of "constructed" full sentences, rather than "single catch words". ------------------  Our final test,  No, we would not recommend this book to a friend 
 Very disappointing, felt like I was reading a magazine article.  Not very valuable information.  
 i really like the look of the toaster, and it does a nice job; on one side. the toasting elements on one side in each slot do not fully heat up so it toasts one side more than the other - will be trying to get it repaired, or likely, will have to get a new one. 
 While I enjoyed reading the first half of this book, the second was pure agony. I actually started to skim through most of the pages until I reached the end.  It is dense with detail; almost too dense. For instance, Finney spends way too much time describing an office building ablaze in fire. His descriptions are interesting for about 3 pages, but by page 10 of the fire, I was completely and totally bored. Now, I'm not saying fiction should always be a "quick, easy read". Quite the contrary. I found Finney's writing to be refreshing. But c'mon folks, this book should have been 100-150 pages shorter. (Strictly for over-the-top romance lovers). 
 I thought this would have more actual crafts inside. I expected the projects to be dated (obviously, hence the kitsch factor), but they were plain tacky and a few required tough-to find and/or expensive supplies (resin grapes, anyone?). The illustrations are colorful and entertaining, but it looks like the author just ripped off a bunch of old ads from the fifties and added a sparse amount of lame craft patterns (like a really complicated lace doily as well as a difficult embroidery pattern with little or no help in the way of learning the stitches!) here and there for posterity. It's better for someone who already has a strong background in crafting, and doesn't mind filling in the considerable gaps in the instructions with their imagination. Don't waste your money 
 Amazon asked me to review this book, which is funny, considering I still haven't received the copy I ordered more than a month ago!  If you really want this book, you might try getting it elsewhere 
 Given that this is the man who claimed to have predicted the fall of the Soviet Union years before it occurred, I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately after having read this dirge, I'm suspicious that Todd would be incapable of predicting what day tomorrow is.   The book starts with a self promoting preface, wherein Todd tries to play up some vague Pro American sympathies he professes to have, which given the later content is somewhat reminiscent of Robert Mugabe's early eulogising of white farmers in Zimbabwe.  Todd's book has two main premises, one, that the US is a spent power, using it's military to intimidate other nations into providing it the capital and goods that it needs to continue it's parasitic existence. The other that Europe (A united superpower version of the EU, which doesn't actually exist), Russia and Japan should realise they are the masters of the earth, not the US. (He seems to periodically forget China exists).   To support this disturbed worldview, he proceeds to give bizarre, specious arguments using faulty logic. (The US is equally to blame for the Russian situation in Chechnya was one eyebrow raising example - although in this case, it was probably driven by his desire to portray Russia as a positive force compared to the wicked US).  His main arguments are basically vague attempts at portraying a world he would like to see (Europe, specifically France, as a global colossus, bolstered by the Economic and military might of Russia and Japan). He brushes over such things as the demographic meltdown of Germany, presenting it as a positive force since it means that Germany will eventually shrink to about the same size population as France, at which point the Franco - German axis will be a partnership of equals!   The peculiar self-deluding bigotry that permeates the French so called elite. is present in spades in this book, and unfortunately just comes across , as a wish list from a man who  hasn't realised that his countries imperial days ended in 1945.   A huge disappointment, I had hoped for an insightful analysis of the real problems that afflict the US, not a bigoted attack shrouded in pseudo intellect and drowned in meaningless statistics.    
 American Originals is a poor, dry shadow of The American Religion written  by Harold Bloom several years ago.  It has none of the thrill of following  and intimately disecting the american direction in  religious ontology.  It  has an overall air of Ho-Hum.  A feeling of "I wrote this book because  I could."  Not that its facts are terribly inaccurate but the point is  that if I wanted a dictionary of religious history I would have bought one 
 I'm afraid that I was disappointed by this 1936 movie of French gangsters in the Casbah. I suppose this was a copy of American gangster movies, but Jean Gabin as a suddenly love sick hard guy willing to risk prison for a pretty face is not believable. In fact, none of the characters seemed realistic. They were almost cartoonish. Humphrey Bogart or James Cagney in their 1930's gangster movies were far more realistic and their films hold up better. Because Gabin's love for Juline Duvivier is not developed, we can not understand why Pepe would give up the sexy life he has in his exotic world. The best part of the movie is Pepe's walk to the harbor. The camera follows him from behind and from unusual angles and cuts. There is a Citizen Kane feeling in these shots. The gritty tear scene at the end is interesting also. Technically this movie is not up to American Gangster movies, but you can see the influence on Godard in the 50's 
 My 2 1/2 year old son loves this book and I think most children familiar with the movie will because it presents familiar characters and situations.  But it feels *so* incredibly tossed off!  The writing is slapdash, lackluster and just pathetically bad.  Good storytelling is more than just hitting the high notes of a film -- if you're going to bother making a book, it should read well *as a book*.  This book lacks the heart and soul that actually "animates" the movie 
 This book was horrible I couldn't get into it all. I loved Black and ugly but Hustler's son was not as well written 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, "The Descent" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, "The Descent"  "The Descent" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.  At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.  Even though "The Descent" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.  "The Descent" is unrated and contains violence and language 
 Como aficionado acérrimo de MVLL desde la Ciudad y los Perros, encontré esta última novela bastante decepcionante.  El personaje central se tilda a sí mismo de cacaseno, precisamente el vocablo que utilizaba MVLL contra los apristas en las elecciones del 90.  Pero es más un aburrido total sin pizca de la picardía limeña.  Cuando el personaje estaba a punto de tirarse al río en París, daba ganas de darle un buen empujón para ahorrarnos por lo menos cien páginas más de tortura.  Y su contacto con las eventos sociales de las últimas décadas se asemeja a la de un Forrest Gump quien todo lo ve y nada lo capta.  Pero quien diga que la vena de MVLL ya se acabó se equivoca: la reciente Fiesta del Chivo es fenomenal.  Los hinchas del fútbol tenemos que clarificar una error en el libro: el compadre de Valeriano López en el Boys (y luego en el Alianza) en los años cincuenta fue don Willy Barbadillo, no Jerónimo Barbadillo quien militó en la selección del 82 
 The book was an interesting enough read to keep in my library, but I would not consider it a legitimate argument for the Aquatic Ape Theory - nor, specifically, for the aquatically influenced evolution of the human female and the proceeding ramifications. It approaches the issue in a simplistic, unscientific manner that is not at all convincing. Keeping in mind that this book is dated (having been first published in 1972) could not save it's argument either. The Descent of Woman left just me as I was before and I'll be looking further still for writings on the subject 
 I heard so many raves about this book, so I bought it for my 10 year old. The information to me was sparse, the printed words in the book are so tiny, I almost pulled out my magnifying glass for my child. The internet links, are links you can find on your own, by typing the subject in google. The price for this paperback book is riduculous.  Very disappointed, ended up buying the Kingfisher history book, which I found so much better in reading quality and price, especially since it is a hardback and the Usborne book I bought was a paperback. Check if they have it at the library or school to see if, it is what you want, before you waste your money 
 I bought this from Amazon and I don't like it - the masured temperature drifts from 96.8F to 99.6F in 6 minutes. So inaccurate 
 The author, having spent his military life reading about leadership, tries to write a book about leadership.  What he ended up writing was a book about reading about leadership, and given his own limited writing ability, even his writing recommendations can't be trusted.  I'm going to go read some Heinlein and see if I can't get better recommendations than this 
 Dude, Where's my car?  This is exactly what you'll be saying after you watch this one.  very bad idea 
 I bought a few books on raw feeding and holistic diets and I have to say this is the worst. It's not even about raw meaty bones. This book is more about how the author feels martyred by both the Australian Vet Association and the pet food industry. I guess this might make an interesting story if thats the kind of thing you want to read about. I just found it a tiresome tirade.   Work Wonders, by the same author, is much more informative about raw feeding and can be downloaded for free at [...]. 
 I'm really surprised the authors became so famous as the new gurus of CRM or 1to1 marketing. This book is just a collection of superficial case studies but it says nothing on the technologies used, the real problems companies had to face when they implemented CRM programs. This is just a book for high school kids or sunday newspaper readers who want know more about CRM without getting into the details. Not worth the money and absolutely simplistic 
 I am a reasonably big fan of Madonna. I bought 'Confessions' the day it dropped in November and went twice to see her on the tour in New York City, both of which were such amazing, absolutely incredible nights that I am absolutely thrilled she is in talks for an NBC special to bring the show to network television this fall.  Nevertheless, I cannot honestly recommend this CD single at all.  Don't get me wrong, the 'Confessions' album is an awesome spectacle from start-to-finish, and the remixes for "Hung Up" and "Sorry" are just awesome. The Bill Hamel and Pet Shop Boys remixes of the former and Paul Oakenfold's remix of the latter are so awesome that they equal or even arguably surpass the fun of the originals.  Thus it is all the more dissapointing that the remixes of "Get Together" are as terrible as they are. Even the "Jacques Lu Cont Mix," which is named for the French alter ego of producer Stuart Bryce, who actually produced the original 'Confessions' album, is nothing special, despite its rhythmic, quirky guitar work which sounds promising at first. Quickly something sounds wrong; this sounds like the kind of frothy, slightly above mid-tempo music that one can usually hear played in swanky, high-brow cocktail bars. That's right - lounge music.  "Danny Howells & Dick Trevor KinkyFunk Mix" starts out to be more promising but quickly grows boring due to its meandering, lingering pace and only sparing use of vocals/lyrics. In fact, none of the remixes on the CD use Madonna's vocals enough at all. The remixes of "Hung Up" and "Sorry," however, did, and that was an important part of why they were so good.  The "Tiefschwarz Remix" and "James Holden Remix" are even worse, since the former starts out with propulsive, frothy, initially promising dance beats but then never goes anywhere, while the latter is pure lounge music, complete with the sound of raindrops popping in and out.  The I Love New York (Thin White Duke Mix) is also terrible. Also remixed by Stuart Bryce (Think White Duke is another one of his undercover monikers), this remix yet again does not feature enough Madonna and the beats simply take the song nowhere.  Sure, you would probably dance to all of the songs on this CD if you were in a club and they came on. But for Madonna, they are terrible. And since they overall make minimal use of her vocals, it is doubly hard to find anything satisfying.  Worst of all, the moment I heard "Get Together" I could not WAIT to hear remixes of it, and when I heard it would be a single I was so excited that I would. The original song, from beginning to end, spells "DANCE/POP CLASSIC."   Imagine my dissapointment then when the remixes finally arrived in June and they were this terrible. With such an incredible song, one would think a remixer who knew what they were doing would not be able to mess it up, yet that is exactly what has happened. This CD is certainly not worth the $7.49 I paid on it.  Let's hope Madonna goes back to Bill Hamel, Paul Oakenfold and Pet Shop Boys for the remixes of "Jump." 
 Author doesn't have anything in this book which not already available free of cost on the internet.  It was a total waste of my time and money procuring and reading this book.  May be useful to people who can't search items on their own online. Admire the market who knew how to title useless books like these! 
 Simply put, "A Types" varies little from the hordes of other dime-a-dozen emo records currently crowding the market. Yes, I'll give them respect for trying a different direction from their previous works. However, this new style happens to be the exact same insipid cookie-cutter sound that every other floppyhaired/lip pierced clone band out there is currently doing, only with a few spacey twists. The melodies and song structures wander and meander, in some places building tension and then abandoning the idea without resolution. Sonically, it's lukewarm- never really rocking too hard, never really getting quite as beautiful and spacey as they used to on other records.  I don't recommend this album at all, it is the lowest quality record the band has put out (which isn't surprising, considering only one original member remains). Instead, I recommend '...No Wings to Speak Of", "the Frailty of Words" or "the Satellite Years," in that order.  If you think Thursday and Coheed and Cambria are the best bands ever, you'll probably like this. Which is fine, I don't care how you spend your parent's money.  Finally, Hopesfall should change their name. If George Harrison kicked Paul out after John and Ringo quit and then got 3 other guys to fill in and called the band the Beatles, there would be mass outrage and rioting in the streets. They'd probably hang him. Josh Brigham should be ashamed of himself, really 
 It always struck me as odd that anyone would accept what are clear contradictions in the gospels regarding the events surrounding the alleged resurrection as proof that the events really happened--that this is evidence of a story not contrived and agreed upon afterwards but indicative of the various subjective perspectives each writer brought.  Aside from the fact that the various accounts are too different to be attributed to this prior notion, Christians have a bigger problem; for they believe that the bible is the word of God and is authored not by man but God.  As such, there is no room for contradiction or the hoped-for subjective perspective.  In a nutshell, the standards for human testimony can simply not be applied to an alleged "inerrant word of God."     I give this book two stars instead of one because it has value to the "Josh McDowell" type Christians who think they can intellectualize their sky-daddy myth into credibility.  With this book on their bookshelf, they'll sleep easier at night.   Two stars for being a myth-keeper 
 As someone who has read a lot of inane sports book (if you took out all the f-words in Lenny Dykstra's book, it wouldn't even make for a pamphlet) but this clearly is the worst book ever published by someone who can seems to be able to speak English.  He is entertaining and witty holding a microphone and in the forward, he pretty much admits he just took the money but clearly so did the "editor" and publisher - nothing wrong with that - we don't expect most sport bios or sport commentary books to be very substantial in tone or language but to be pointless, dull and pointless and dull - yes, it's that's pointless and dull.  The premise seems pretty simple - basically give us a rundown on the year on the PGA Tour - give us insights or take us there? Doesn't sound too difficult. Can't write - not a problem - why not just talk into a recorder and someone can type it up, an editor can move things and so forth but to fail on every level?  Nearly every sentence starts out with one idea and wanders off to another completely.  After being a golfer and a commentator for nearly 20 years, you'd think he'd offer some insights - any insights? Except that golf is hard and sometimes unfair ... really? Is it saving it all for the TV?  Funny stories? Nope. Says some stories are funny but can't them to us or writes it in such a manner, it's not funny.  He's infamous as an announcer for being banned from the Masters Tournament - how about setting the record straight? Nope. Gives us some general info everyone knows and then goes into another subject IN THE SAME CHAPTER.  On TV, he is a raconteur and witty but gives ZERO evidence here. Unless you just want it on your shelf to own every golf book or if you intend to hollow it out and store valuables, there's no real point to owning this book as reading material.  For golf fans, this this clear a whiff, the grip slips off, the driver goes flying and knocks us loopy. Even in that condition, we could've written two coherent sentences that McCord is clearly incapable of ...  In contention for the worst book ever published 
 You guessed it: It's the same leftist b.s. we were all taught in school. Please, I'm yawning already.. 
 The only good thing about this movie is the plot.  From there it goes downhill.  The script needs to be rewritten to add some sophistication to it.  The acting is marginal except for the actor that plays Justin.  If the script were rewritten then I think the acting would be better, maybe 
 The book does not live up to its title - most of its information is theoretical and uses examples not relative to the person who would read this book - i.e. smaller business owners.  It is a scholarly overview of the process but for a do-able, step by step approach, I found it highly inferior to John Gross's "Fundamentals of Maintenance" - just because it is written in more difficult language does not make it a better book.  Gross pointed out, and I agree, that people talk ABOUT preventative maintenance and the benefits for your company, but no one tells you how to actually set up a department or actual procedures.  This is that type of a book - all research and very little actual, personal experience.  Bypass this one 
 If you're one of those people who paid money for the book or spent the few hours reading it when you could have been shampooing your hair or some other trivial task, then yes, be mad, feel cheated and confused.  However, if you're like me who came upon this book that someone threw away, you might not be so angry.   Flip forward to 1999, Rosemary wakes from a 27 year coma to find her son, Andy, is the most popular fellow in the world with the ability to bring together all people.  He has no religious agenda other than a "can't we all get along" umbrella that has  succeeded greatly on a worldwide scale.  When it's discovered that our Rosemary is the Mom of the most beloved person in the world, she gets thrown into the arena of celebrity too.    If you look at this book as a whole, it's not particularly good but if you can look at some of the premises, some are kind of interesting.  The ending which at first left me feeling cheated actually took on more meaning when I reread it.    If you come across this book and have nothing to do for about 2 hours, not a bad read...otherwise not really worth your while 
 I bought this with my camera and I guess I didnt realize I could get 3 sony tapes at walmart for the same price. My bad. But I would recommend you get the sony ones locally versus spending $14 on one tape 
 NOTICE: this is not really a sequel.  This is one of those Television movie/mini-series remakes of a theatrical release.  You will not get cinematic visuals, you will get TV quality visuals.  Too many people are not providing appropriate reviews and this is more a betrayal of your consumer bethren.  The original Storm Riders is an amazing fantasy tale, this is not.  This is more like a standard kung fu action flick that uses the characters.  Storm Riders had that fantasy feel, this does not.  There is good kung fu action, but this thing seems incoherent while you are trying to watch it, and that may be because they have tried to cut and paste the movie together, if my theory is correct in that it was a miniseries adaptation.  The story starts and stops with no flow.  If you just want an action flick with some decent fight scenes get this, it's tolerable, but in no way is it on the caliber of Storm Riders.  I really wish they establish a standard that differentiates the TV adaptations from real theatrical releases, such releases tend to be a bit insulting.  The ONLY thing that is redeeming for this is a really cute female actor, and that's it!  I've never seen Wind and Cloud so unattractive, and this is based off Aaron Kwock and Ekin Cheng.  These 2 are appropriate, but no substitute 
 This is honestly one of the worst films I have ever witnessed...gay or straight. I am amazed it actually got made, let alone distributed! I hate to be mean, but it was hard to watch Ms. Lesnick. Her talents must lay elsewhere. She can not act her way out of a box. Oy!! She should have stuck to her Rabbinical Studies. Seriously folks....you should just rent it to see how bad it is...you will be fascinated. I am sure Helen Lesnick is a lovely hard working woman, but what a flat actress. Her heavy black and blue makeup made her look like a Drag Queen and the fact that she says she's 34 in the film is insane! She clearly looked 45 +. I am all for accepting yourself as you age, but the woman had such deep lines in her face, she looked like road map. If you force us to stare at your face for 2 hrs (and tons of annoying Close Ups!! Oy again!)please consider Boxtex next time.  Well she got a film made and out there, starring herself as the lead. I am sure a great accomplishment for her...BUT, PAINFUL for us.   
 In order for a cordless monitor to have any privacy, you need it to be digital and use digital-spread-spectrum (DSS) technology. 900 Mhz is the best frequency for a baby monitor, though. Here's why: It is important for people to know that if you have a wireless network in your house, that it cannot share the same frequencies at any other 2.4 Ghz devices. This includes baby monitors and cordless telephones. The correct arrangement should be: Baby Monitor: 900 Mhz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS) WiFi Netowrk: 2.4 Ghz Cordless Telephone: 5.8 Ghz Digital-Spread-Spectrum (DSS 
 Bought this as a first introduction.  It's very, very, high level.  Maybe to the point of useless.  Six Sigma does have, at it's core, some statistics - it would be useful for anyone trying to learn the approach to understand a few of the basic statistical concepts.  There are mistakes in the few numerical examples that are offered, probably creating more confusion than insight 
 This is a very well-written book, but it is OVER THIRTY YEARS OLD. The selection of topics was excellent for the time, but it is now a different time. If you are not yet brain-dead, i.e. not content with teaching only what you learned as a grad student, try something more current, such as Chaikin and Lubensky 
 The expectations for this film were high- a good cast and a promise of a remake of an old movie using today's technology.  Alas- the movie was disappointing. The characters were not developed and the were quite flat.  The action starts very soon in the movie (the wave striking the ship) and thus there was no opportunity for them to develop.  The course of the movie did not allow for any significant development. Moreover, the special affects and all the action are not very well tied together or simply not believable. For example all the surviving passangers, including a young kid prove to be record swimmers that can hold their breath for a long period.  It is a pity as if the script was a bit better and more developed the film could have been enjoyable. 
 The author has a terrible time of writing without skipping around and overshooting the reader.This book is not for the novice of history or christianity.Its a very hard subject to cover when you leave god out of the equation.Its from a point of view that looks at jesus and the apostles as average people. The book has a great amount of knowledge but the author to me is a bad writter. 
 Schuller desires to take the reader down a feel-good road.  Unfortunately, the path is littered with little more than cliches and pop-psychology.  The text is a series of sound-bytes which is easily equalled or surpassed in most any book of collected quotations, or, if one prefers, a Google-search under choice key words.  The road signs of the book (i.e. the gist of the text) are 1) you feel unfulfilled; 2) don't worry, be happy; 3) oh yes, and God wants you to be happy.  All the road signs are supplemented with the above-mentioned sound-bytes and pop-psychology.  In keeping with the spirit of the book, I took the path and stopped at Schuller's lemon tree.  Unfortunately the lemons were not good.  I then tried to make lemonade.  Unfortunately the lemons were so bad that no amount of sweetner could make them palatable.  In fact, it became unhealthy.  I tried several other uses, but all were equally unproductive and unhealthy.  I began to wonder why--then I realized that lemon trees, in order to produce palatable fruit, must be trimmed regularly.  The lemon tree at the side of this particular road is in need of serious trimming.  There is better and more nutricious fruit to be found elsewhere.  Even the old cliche "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" is of no use when the tree itself is no good.  It is this last part that Schuller fails to adequately address.  Too bad.  I strongly suggest you take a different and more scenic road that bears much better fruit 
 This book is a good review guide for the A+ exams, however a lot of the material in it is out of date 
 I have to agree whole heartedly with the previous reviewer on this.  It is obvious that Aune has not read very much of Rothbard's work and has focused entirely on the criticism of his work written by anarcho-socialists (who haven't even read Rothbard either).  Aune's glaring errors about Rothbard's writing and Aune's tiresome descriptions of "market failure" and "oppression of the proletariat" are predictable and boring. Aune also engaged in a form of intellectual dishonesty common to marxists for the last 150 years. She did not even mention government failure or the impossibility for any collective organization to rationally organize the means of production due to the lack of a free pricing system provided by the free market.  His dishonesty was that he consistently talked about the glory of marxism by discussing the evils (failure) of capitalism.  There was no discussion about how a socialist society would be organized or its own "glory."  Where was the discussion about the paradise of Cambodia?  Or the worker's utopia of Albania?  But I should not be surprised by Aune, he's just following in the footsteps of every other marxist that came before him.    
 I, too, wish I could get my money and time back...even though it only took me 3 hours to read it over 2 days. I laughed 4 times in the whole book. I just expected more from Larry. The last couple chapters were the funniest, and the part about Easter made me laugh out loud...but the rest was just crude. I can take crudeness but the CONSTANT mention of the "t" word for breasts was annoying. I've always hated that word and this just sealed it. I really enjoy watching Larry's cable specials but this book was just a disappointment 
 Keneally writes reasonably well -- not exciting, but serviceable prose. Possibly if you are a committed Catholic and interested in the difference between today's Catholic beliefs and those of fifty years ago, this novel might keep you awake. Otherwise, this novel is exhausting in its exploration of an inexperienced priest's coming-of-age, and the plot is slow-paced--I couldn't make it to the promised murder. Besides, the victim was so uninteresting, I couldn't bring myself to care who might have killed her 
 I bought these for my wife for x-mas based on their picture.  They arrived, she put them on.  Both earings had the stones fall out and frame break within a half a day.  They are junk and the company that sent them cannot be trusted.  Be careful!!!  
 I purchased this book and McFadden's follow-up on Scotland (which I haven't yet read) based on the local newspaper's Travel section recommendation of the Scottish title.  If the book on Scotland is much like the one on Ireland I'm not looking forward to reading it.  McFadden spends  too much of his narrative observing himself and his unexpected travelling  companion, the impulsive Spanish chambermaid/photographer/poet Lourdes  Brasil, then he does the people and landscapes of Ireland.  I grew tired of  his self-congratulatory asides that Lourdes was gaining admiring glances  from the Irish.  I wanted to know more, to SEE more about the land he was  travelling through and the people he was encountering.  And instead of  making countless references to the photographs both he and Lourdes were  taking, he should've included some of the photos in the book.  Overall, I  wanted more descriptions, to gain more of a sense of being there in  Ireland.  Instead I was left with the feeling that I had eavesdropped on  the unexpected frolic of a middle-aged man and a young Spanish chambermaid  who just happened to meet in Ireland and drive around the countryside for a  bit.  For a better sense of place, skip McFadden's book and try any of the  series of travelling and life in Ireland by Niall Williams and Christine  Breen 
 Similar to the other reviewer, my seams ripped the first time i used it.  I don't like top loading as well, but it seems pretty common.  Would avoid and spend an extra $20 and get something else.  It does fit into carry on regulations, however. 
 A great idea, poorly executed. This is the book Mel Brooks would have written if he had been born in West Haven, and attended Lawrenceville Academy. Yiddish by Episcopalians 
 I had pretty high expectation of this book.  Unfortnately I was disapointed.  With the exception of the chapter dealing with how to navigate through towns and cities there was nothing that hasn't been written about a thousand times before. Along with the fact that everything was written as though you've never seen a bicycle before.  What's up with that!?!  It's not totally with out merit if you've never done any distance bicycling.  But there are certainly better books out there that cover the same material and in a much more entertaining fashion.  I suggest you look else where for your bike touring information 
 BAsed on some good and some bad reviews, I bought the book to see for myself.  Let's just say I gave the book away for free, because it's not worth the bookshelf space.  If you really know anything about voip security, you'll know this book is a waste.  It's not technically wrong, but it's easy to be not wrong when you don't say much.  You can learn more from NIST and vendor docs than from this book.  My respect for CISSPs dropped after reading their positive reviews of this book 
 I was raised in Virginia and never understood the details of the Battle of Yorktown. Now I see the big picture and how all the regional events in the glorious cause fit together. Immediately after finishing this book I returned to Yorktown with an entirely different understanding. I could relive the battle as if I had been there during the war. It was fascinating! I never learned this from history books.  Male Age 60 
 I found this book to be quite interesting and insightful. However, I was turned off initially by the assumption by the author that the readers of her book were "European American", which I am not.  Throughout  the book she wrote about how European American women might relate to and  view Kwan-Yin, seeming to forget that other non-European women are both  literate and spiritual and may have an interest in and reverence for Kwan  Yin 
 The book is great but though I was charged for the shipping and handling , still I recieved the book in a bad shape and I did not complain because my last purchase was the same and I/my account/reputation with the custmer service  would have looked bad. But generally the book is great and I recommend it for every body but try to ship it to the US address and let somebody bring it to you as it will save you money and you will have an undamaged book which you could sell it in the future 
 This book is not very helpful and confusing to use. A lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels IF you buy those brands. 
 I don't know what the other reviewers got out of this book, as it contains nothing but a hodgepodge of scales, notes, & chords with no real explaination of what is going on or why.    I can read music but if you are a guitar player used to tabs, you won't like this.  You'd be better off buying something geared towards guitar, such as REH Jazz Solos for Guitar.    You'll gain a "jazz vocabulary" by playing, by imitating, and then creating something from that, but not by anything in this book.  There is no approach, no method, nor any useful information in this book.       
 Great book... if you are 12 and smoke crack.  Seriously, who in their right mind would write this **** 
 This bible as far as the commentary goes should be considered heretical. For instance the commentator of the book of Esther considers the book three seperate tales combined to make historical points but cannot be proved to be historically true. So far this has made me uncomfortable with this Bible being one of my main sources of study. Although this Bible seems to be very scholarly in its content reaserched seemingly thoroghly, giving good information. It seems that the contributors are attempting to undermine divine inspiration of the Bible. This study Bible must be used always with other study Bibles sound in its doctrine. 
 Back in the 1990's, Steven Segal and Jean-Claude Van Damme were the stars going head to head at the cinema for these types of movies. They, unlike Arnold, Bruce Willis, and Stallone, were both heavy into martial arts. Both had similiar acting styles (look mean -hit people). Both went into the straight to video route after a few under performing theatrical releases. But if Seagal keeps putting out crap like this, Van Damme might be looked upon in 100 years from now as the better of the two. He did afterall, go into sci-fi, tried more creative approaches in his movie plots and acted as if he really wanted to be an actor...he played a ex-con, a cop, a soldier,a father, even twins with more depth. Sure, he fell like Seagal in the end, but not as hard.    Seagal, on the other hand, stayed the course with very few exceptions (except The Patriot) playing all characters the same. And somewhere in the late 1990s, tried to add a environmental message into his films, sometimes awkwardly.    I heard, but don't know for sure, that he dated or married a Chinese lady, and this changed his movie style to the Asian themed, Asian style direction, and the choppy editing that have plagued his latest films.    You have read the reviews of Out to A Kill so I won't go into it. But I do have suggestions for Steven if he ever reads Amazon.com    This movie would have worked better if he was a retired professor whose son was framed. He could have married a Chinese woman. He goes to China to snoop around about his son being in jail, and kills a bad guy who is with those that are smuggling the goods. The rest of the bad guys, as well as the Chinese police, and the American police are after him until the gets to the bottom of it and proves his son's innocence.Explain somewhere in the film he was martial arts teacher at the college he taught and one time was a champion so he kicks butt realistically..      In fact, in this movie no characters (such as his wife)that are really explained....they just come and go.The acting is terrible all around.    Action is nice and expected, but the story actually matters and time alloted for character's personalities to come together has to happen for it to be well recieved by most people (remember Under Seige?)Then it might get a theatrical release instead of the usual straight to video hell.    LOSE WEIGHT. Be like other stars.Take pride in yourself. When a movie is in pre-production, other stars hit the gym, go jogging, etc. George Clooney once said he got in shape by cutting back on eating and working out hard twice a day for 8 weeks or more before shooting started. Stallone trained for months before the Rocky and Rambo flicks.    Take acting lessons. Show more emotional range and still be a tuff guy. Maybe like Bruce Willis in his later roles?     Get rid of the long leather jackets. It makes you look like My Cousin Vinney...totally out of place.     Do something with the hair. Anything. Tie it back like you used to if nothing else.     Play parts that fit your age, like Clint Eastwood does.     Practice your martial arts and get your edge back so we don't have to endure stunt doubles, slow motion, camera tricks. Be like Jackie Chan and be real.     Your fans love you so please respect them by no longer turning out doggie-do like this 
 These blank discs are defective. I was never able to record any pictures or audio data to them.  The Maxell blank discs that I have did the job fine. 
 Mr. Dennett's book demonstrates the ignorance, irrationality, and dishonesty  of humanists. Discussing the meaning of word materialsim, Professor Dennett says:  "In its scientific or philosophical sense, it refers to a theory that aspires to explain all the phenomena without recourse to anything immaterial--like a Cartesian soul, or "ectoplasm"--or God. The standard negation of materialistic in the scientific sense is dualistic, which maintains that there are two entirely different kinds of substance, matter and ...whatever minds are supposedly made of." (p. 302)  Philosophers stopped believing in dualism a thousand years ago with the development of metaphysics. A modern view is that man is an indefinability that becomes conscious of its own existence.   The philosophy that God does not exist is not materialism, it is naturalism. Materialism is the view that all that exists is matter. Materialists frequently say that free will is an illusion and that the experience of the existence of oneself is some kind of epiphenomena. (In a quote below, you will see that Dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in.)  It is not clear from the book whether Dennett is a materialist, but he is certainly a naturalist. Concerning the proof of God's existence, he trots out David Hume's "Who made God?" which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality. I refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof.  Let's look at two quotes, the first is at the end of the chapter "Belief in Belief" and the other at the beginning of the chapter "Morality and Religion":   "That is, isn't it true that, whether or not God exists, religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy, in the rule of law, in free will? The very widespread (but far from universal) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning." (p. 245)  " Without the divine carrot and stick, goes this reasoning, people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires, beak their promises, cheat on their spouses, neglect their duties, and so on.  There are two well-known problems with this reasoning: (1) it doesn't seem to be true, which is good news, since (2) is is such a demeaning view of human nature." (p. 279)  In the first chapter, he mentions "bulwark of morality" and "meaning." But in the second chapter, he leaves out "meaning."  If our purpose in life is not to get to heaven, what is our purpose is life?   Whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief. Mr. Dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist Christians.  There are worse things than divorcing your spouse. Disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said. Mr. Dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life.  The only miracle mentioned in Mr. Dennett's book is the Shroud of Turin, which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man.  Since no one claims to know how the image got there, it can be called a miracle. However, Mr. Dennett does not tell us anything about it. The reader is left to find out about the famous relic by looking it up on the internet. 
 What's with people always praising this _______ band?  Stones suck.  Unlike their opposite enemies (or basically, their mirrored version) The Beatles, the Rolling Stones did not do _____ for rock.  All they did is create another _________ bad-boy image for fat bikers (don't think I'm insulting motorcycle enthusiasts) who ride around with their morons and call themselves "Hells Angels".  No evolution of any kind, nothing ot look forward to, and _____ lyrics.  NOthing wrong with fun lyrics, but The Rolling Stones's lyrics were typical, mindless, thoughtless, retarded, I could go on.  NOthing wrong with suggestive (Can't use  that other th ree letter word because amazon won't post my review) lyrics, but goot ahave something clever, like the great song "The Bad Touch".  The music itself also sucks.  Boring, simple, repititive, and boring.  Hoe can people like this mess of crappy generic beats and music, I have no clue.  Ballads?  DOn't give a _____ what they have, The Beatles were about 100 times better, and these old ______heads still don't no when to quit.    I must admit, I was a bit of a sheep (_____) and went blindly, but I am cimpletlyt out of that and with every overrated band I hate, I am getting closer to my own opinons forming.  SO if you see me write a hate review for Altar Of Madness despite evbery metalhead  praising it.  So Don't get mad okay?  So in closing, I leave you withb these word: deal with it, you ________.  PS  Reaaaaaaaaly bad example.  Altars of Madness rules.  If you don't have that now, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?!  I was going to review it next, but some reason, Rolling Stones just came up to me.  My next review will be for Altars of Madness 
 Certainly this album offers very little to a fan of The Ocean Blue's eariler work.  The vocals and guitars sound quite different (gone is that beautiful dreamy sound).  And what about those awesome saxaphone and  keyboard sounds that made their earlier tracks so fun?  Just because Steve  Lau is gay is no reason for the band to abandon keyboards altogether.  So,  anyway, what does this album offer instead?  Harder sounding guitar,  angrier sounding vocals, and songs that are somewhat intersting, but are  lacking in any magic that would make you want to listen to them after  you've had the CD for a couple weeks.  Exceptions: "Whenever You're  Around", and "Slide" are good enough songs to standout  inspite of boring production 
 I bought this CD not long after it came out.  It didn't last long in my collection because it only has a few good songs on it!!!  I like Somehow Our Love Survives and Abandoned Garden.  Other than that this is a mediocre effort for Michael. He has used this kind of Brazilian theme on Sleeping Gypsy already. Stick with your roots Michael...you are from California...not South America. Try buying Blue Pacific instead!!! I abandoned this one a long time ago 
 I have not heard Kerplunk, but probably out of Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, and American Idiot, this is the only one I would truly label as bad (Nimrod was better, but not great either). The sound is very forced. Green Day admitted that they tried to make it darker sounding to lash out at fans who criticized them as sellouts. It also was trying a little too hard to preserve the "I'm still punk" notion which fortunately Green Day gave up years later.  I have known for a long time that Billie Joe was never the best guitar player, (except the guitar playing is pretty good now)and Brain Stew's refrain that is supposed to sound like a ticking clock is very bad. It sounded even worse in the live album, Bullet in the Bible.  Geek Stink Breath is really the only other song on this album I liked. However, its too short and the guitar playing way too simple.   In general, unless you are a major Green Day fan, there really isn't much you're missing in this album. 
 The Good Girl is a Horror of a film. It imagines itself as an ode to the everyman, trapped in a humdrum existence. What it becomes on film is an insulting example of Hollywood filmmaking at its worst. I use the word insulting because that is what I felt as I watched this movie. Aniston, Nelson, Gyllenhaal, all are trying so hard to be average that they seem on the verge of a "Forrest Gump" imitation.  Gyllenhaal and Aniston in particular seem to be doing a caricature of working folk. The way they slump around and furrow their brows as they trudge thru the tired dialog, it's as though each is fighting to understand what the other is saying.   The film itself is grey and dull. The other characters in the film flat and stereotypical (i.e. the coworker who invites her to bible study).   Overall this movie isn't worth the time or effort it took to transfer it to DVD. In another era it probably would have never made it to the screen. Oh how I miss that era..... 
 I received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas.  The chest is beatiful and will be great for future use; however, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea.  Although the bags are highly aromatic, the tea is very bland, as if the bags were old. I am sure Bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty, just not the box I received. 
 I saw this movie and decided to do housework while I was watching it. About 1/2 way through it, I became bored with the movie and just did housework. I am sorry, but this movie is just plain awful. The only reason I started to watch this movie is because it said it was by the director of "Boogeyman". Yes, I was one of those few people that liked the "Boogeyman". I try not to rate movies this low when I watch them, but this one deserves a "0". Watch "The Zodiac" instead. It is much better and informative than this piece of trash 
 My reaction to this book was the eventual impetus to just go out and purchase other books on meditation because the style and approach of the author were so irksome to me. I bought it because of the simple eloquence of the cover and the title, and I think I did read the first page when I was in the store. It looked straightforward, and I did indeed want to learn simply "how to meditate", being a beginner. (I subsequently learned that there are actually a few books called "how to meditate".)   I felt it was important to write a review because there seem to be so many positive ones, and it seems a book that may work for some, but for some like me, it's a real turn-off, although fortunately for me I just resolved to look for other meditation books (I've been using the "Getting in the Gap" meditation most extensively, and been trying to read a couple other books). There are a few reasons I wanted to learn how to meditate... one of them being the hope of maybe experiencing moments of deep insight or contact with something mystical or angelic, and at one point the author actually more or less actually discourages this aspect of meditation. He specifically refers to the possibility of these types of experiences during meditation, saying that you can just basically ignore it and keep going with the meditation, because these aren't the important part of meditation. It would seem to me if you had a mystical experience during meditation it would be something important enough to pay attention to, whether "real" or not.   This annoyed me, but my disagreement with that view was not so much the problem, as the consistent authoritarian and absolute style of his teachings on meditation. He seemed so focused on the shoulds and shouldn'ts of the whole discipline, which to me in a way is sort of going against the whole notion of meditation, and it made me put the book down. I did his first breathing exercise, which was fine, and I tried to go on with the book, but the style of his teaching was too much for me. It was annoying because the cover looks so elegant and zen-like and then what was inside, to me, seemed at odds with that.   Basically, if an an air of finality in an instructive book on meditation doesn't appeal to you, then you may want to read-before-you-buy. Because of my frustration with it, I was only able to get 15 pages or so into it, so I can't say much to the teachings of the book, only the way in which it was presented 
 I guess this wasnt the type of book for me... it was boring, not surprising, and it felt like 3 months had gone by since i started the book (took me 2 weeks to read)! If i hadn't had to read this for school I would've never finished it 
 I admit, I can't help getting caught up in the the whole "chill-out" music craze.It just gets the best of me.But if this turkey is supposed to relax you, I'm sure a 50 cent cd would get me more "chilled" than this junk.Seriously, I give it credit for 3 good songs on the first disc, but that's about it.The rest is either really freaky sounding acoustic music (friday's dust is one example), or cheap little techno beats.The more chillout cd's I'm buying, the more I come to realize that it's just a trend waiting to burn out-personally, next time I wanna get "chilled", I'll pop in some mellow r n'b, or somethin' jazzy 
 I don't know what is up with the Entrepreneur-magazine series of books, but I've read several of them now and I've yet to be impressed with any of them. The best way to describe this book...BLAND AND FULL OF FLUFF. Most of them are apparently written by people who have NO real-world business experience. They are not recommended 
 I have news for Deedra, it is just as humiliating, infuriating, and degrading for a father as it is for a mother. If women spent more time meeting the short and long term needs of their children they wouldn't be so wounded. Mother's start out on top with the legal system and usually end up on top. Deedra and the other women are heard by the legal system even when they whisper. It doesn't need to be a fight if everyone is concentrating on our children. Children need a mother and a father even if those people live in different homes. 
 this cd is not all that....srry 2 all my girls but 2 tell u the truth he needs 2 sit down!!!!! "do u mind"....yes i do that song is borin 2 me!!if i were 2 like 1 song on there it wud b "all because of u" i cant lie 2 u i dnt like that song either i wasted money on this cd!!!!...haha thats y i sold it 4 $13.00 no offense but its not worth it chris brown on the other hand....thats a cd u wanna buy haha bAy ArEa stand up!!! 
 PEST CONTROL was my first book by Mr. Fitzhugh and 30 pages into it I decided it will probably be my last.  The plot outline--ordinary Joe too fixated on his entomological obsession to notice he's been accidentally mistaken for an international assassin--is an ingeniously set stage ripe for grand comedy.  Alas, the curtain never rises above knee level.  The central events & conversations which must create the grand illusion on which the story hinges are unimaginative, unconvincing, and alas, not very funny.  The story goes from there into an adolescent action slapstick, full of too many hastily-created throwaway characters that mostly showcase the author's lack of descriptive power.  If ever a story cried out for an editor this it it.  His awful similes ("Their hearts were harder than trying to open an oyster with a wet bus ticket.") only look good compared to the juvenile imagination which chases the increasingly implausible plot into an oddly tedious crescendo of casual New York slaughter.  The final resolution tries to leap too many logical potholes to survive the crossing into epilogue intact.  The utter unreality of Fitzhugh's cartoonish world could have been a comedic asset if it were consistent, but it doesn't just migrate as the pages wear on, it gallops away, leaving this reader wondering by the end why he didn't quit on page 30 
 It's a big nasty mess.  As big of a mess and disappointment as Floa 
 I couldn't get past Chapter 6. Abbie is pathetic. Just when you think you have her figured out, something will be stated that completely changes your perception of her. However, that statement never has basis anywhere else in the book, and doesn't fit in with Abbie's personality. The book itself is not very funny, and not at all a gripping read. I do not recommend it 
 This book explores a phenomenon termed "psychic vampirism".  Specifically, it deals with people who limit the energy and auras of others via vampiric tendencies that sometimes augment their own energy and aura.  Amazing.  However, the author does not cite a lot of evidence to support his claims.  As a Ph.d. I would imagine that he would be accustomed to supporting all of his claims with facts.  The problem with this book is that while there are some intriguing clues into psychic vampirism, the author combines reincarnation, astral projection, aura viewing, crystal healing, etc. without really proving any of them.  There are some very interesting photographs of auras.  The author should've provided more of that type of information instead of going from one claim to the next without really proving the vast majority of them 
 Okay so I thought this book was supposed to be really great, but when I read it, it seemed very outdated; almost as if it were written hundreds of years ago.  Also, I am so over Ben Franklin.  So, he invented the kite and the can opener. I think that we as a society would have figured those things out for ourselves after a while anyway.   I was looking for some good witty sayings to use when I picked up this book.  Until I turn 75 next year, I will not consider myself old and will not be using any of the outdated sayings or information in this book.  As far as an almanac goes, my arthritic joints do just fine in predicting the weather for me.  In terms of up to date information , I would like to recommend Player Haters by Carl Weber.  
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 This ring does NOT look as pictured.  It arrived today (almost 3 weeks after I ordered it) and is extremely thin, has tarnish marks, and the metal filigree on the crown shows up only in random places.  It looks like it came out of a vending machine and I'm obviously pretty disappointed.  I won't be buying anything from this vendor again 
 Save yourself the shipping costs of returning, don't make my mistake. THIS IS THE US EDITION EXPORTED TO CANADA! This is not the real UK edition. Not even close!!! Who knows why they think Americans want to hear this stuff, but go and order from the MoS website or from amazon.co.uk. This disaster never used to occur in years past before HMV "teamed" with Amazon, go figure 
 this book contains information that is basic business common sense.  if you dont know how businesses in general operate, you shouldnt be buying this book anyway.  WHERE ARE THE NUMBERS AND THE INDUSTRY SPECIFICS???? i got nothing from this book and have no background in self storage or real estate.  i kept turning to the next chapter hoping to see some useful data but it never appeared.  the only thing that was of any use was the sample income statement in the back of the book.  DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  you could find much more information on self storage by visiting various free websites and forums online.  very dissapointin 
 compared to this revised edition, i would rather refer to the original work of W. D. Ross, whose translation is excellent and marvelous. i recommend this one but don't know where to get it now 
 One can't be sure that this book isn't deliberately exploiting a cynical belief that most business books are so bad, that if this weren't crappy, it wouldn't sell. Even for someone who believes in Csik's theory of flow, this book is a no-win blow-out. Instead of making clear statements backed by evidence, the book's tone and presentation are mere editorializing assertions. There is no reason to read this, when his original popularization, Flow, more carefully and clearly summarizes Csikszentmihalyi's interesting research. 
 I was not into this movie at all.  My mother recommended it to me but it was lame all the way through.  A middle-aged man decides he wants to do something different with his life, so he takes a dance class.  Ofcourse there's a fine dance instructor, a crush is pursued, a wife gets jealous, hires a detective, and *gasp* his crush is found out.  The movie was too predictable and it just wasn't for me.  Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea.  Richard Gere was cute as usual, which was the only thing that made me watch it to the end, besides wanting to know what a correct quick step looked like since "So You Think You Can Dance" never had contestants who mastered it 
 Whoever wrote this book has a great idea in having students actually working things out to find solutions, but to expect students to discover in an hour what geniuses discovered after many years is unrealistic. There are little to no examples, no glossary, and the hints are useless in helping the student understand the concept. All in all, a very poor book 
 If you are looking for actual good workouts look to Oxygen or Womens M&F 
 Pauly "The Weasel" Shore stars as himself in this movie about well, himself as he goes threwout the movie, backtracking and tracking forward on how his career went down the drain. He had hit movies, Son-In-Law, Encino Man, In The Army Now, Bio-Dome and Jury Duty. He had a failed Fox TV show and no one liked him anymore. He keeps bugging fellow actors to ask the director for a spot in their movie. Anyway, Shore gets a visit from the "Ghost of Sam Kinison" and Kinison tells him you'll be famous if you're dead. So, Pauly Shore fakes his own death and everyone mourns him, even his # 1 fan Bucky (W. Earl Brown) but soon everyone finds out that he faked his death, so he goes to Celebrity Prison, everyone hates him. In prison, Shore shacks up with Todd Bridges and has encounters with Heidi Fleiss, Tommy Lee and Carlos Gomez. Soon, Shore wants to be known as Pauly Shore the actor, not The Weasel anymore. Funny in a bunch of parts and cameos are scattershot as well...some cameos include Ben Stiller, Tom Sizemore, Michael Madsen, Britney Spears, Bill Maher, Paris and Nicky Hilton, Fred Durst, Andy Dick, Mario Lopez, Carrot Top, Vince Vaughn, Rico Suave, Dustin Diamond, Charlie Sheen, Verne Troyer, Clint Howard, Sean Penn, Kurt Loder, Pamela Anderson, Dr. Dre, Whoopi Goldberg, Jason Mewes, Kato Kaelin, Snoop Dogg, Thommy Chong, Ja Rule, Chris Rock, Ellen DeGeneres, Corey Feldman, Rick Ducommmun, Mark McGrath, Montell Williams, Perry Ferrell, Matt Pinfield, Taylor Negron, Jerry Springer, Adam Sandler (voice only) and many others. Deep down, The Weasel fails to deliver the goods. Pauly Shore Is Dead, dies along the wa 
 This is a fast-paced book with all the formulaic elements required of a political thriller. Nothing here particularly surprised me. I would guess that if you have enjoyed Mr. Flynn's other works you will enjoy this one as well.  Mr. Flynn needs a more assertive editor. His use of language is so sloppy as to distract a reasonably sensitive reader from the finer points of the story. This probably isn't detrimental to the reader's comprehension, but it is irritatng.  Finally, one very minor quibble: non-standard spellings are used throughout (such as "harken" rather than "hearken"). This may or may not matter to any given reader, but I found it to be worthy of mention 
 i struggled to get past the first 150 pages of this pile of words.  too bad the thing only runs 270 pages or so, because alan furst has become a first-rate cure for insomnia 
 I am a breast cancer survivor and I find this pink dressed, blond "doll" of  perfection rather insulting to my female self, the perfect perky boobs, the long blond hair, the body that does not exist on a woman after the ravages of chemotheraphy.  I can perfectly understand Mattel wanting to support breast cancer research and donate a portion of proceedes towards funding (and thank you for your generosity), but to do it under the guise of selling a "doll" which does not reflect the community of women who have experienced the challenges of recovery and survivorship...a doll which does not look like a survivor is literally painful and insulting!  Why doesn't this doll have a wig?  Why doesn't she have a breast removed?  Why doesn't she have a bra fitted with a form to mimic the shape of a breast?  What is wrong with reality?  Why can't Mattel acknowledge the true nature of this disease and make a doll which comforts, not insults the sensibility of women who have suffered from this disease.  I will purchase this doll, just because I am horrified by the product itself.  I will disrobe her, and with a saw, cut off her breast so that she will look more like me, a survivor, a woman of pride.  I will dismantle the construct of supposed beauty and make this image more like my own - because I am what is woman, not the facade of a false construction.  
 i bought this item as so many people has said how much they loved it.  i find it a nightmare!  if you stand in the corridor between the monitor and the receiver it cuts out.  it does not work when on the charger.  it does not work unless there is a clear line between the two parts. what a piece of junk.  I would in no way recommend this product to anyone 
 This frame looks great until you turn it on. The picture quality is less than stellar, but that isn't what annoyed me about this frame. When you buy this frame don't expect to view your photos at the 16:9 ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program. What does that mean you ask? That means that your photos won't fill the entire screen in the 4:3 mode. You will have 2 black bars on either side of your images; This will not take advantage of the entire frame. If you switch to the 16:9 mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame, making peoples faces distorted. I have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation. See below.  The build quality of the frame is pretty good. If Mustek would fix the 16:9 problem and get a better quality screen, this would be a nice little frame.  A little work is evolved setting up the pictures for the 16:9 ratio, but I figured it out. 16:9 stretches the image, making it look distorted. These steps compensate for the stretch and make your images appear normal. I set up a macro in Photoshop allowing me to do a batch in one click of the mouse. You will just need to keep an eye out on how it crops the image. Some of your images might be better served one at a time.   Start with an image that is 1024x768 in your image editing program.   1. Go to the image size menu and change the width of the image to 77% (or 788 pixels)   This will make the image look distorted. That is ok.   2. Then go to the canvas size menu and crop the height of the image to 77% (or 591 pixels)              The image is ready to save. You might want to save as in to another folder so you can go back to your original if needed.   3. Copy your edited images on to the flash card and insert into the frame 
 Now I know that there is a difference a BIG difference between a songwriter, poet and comedian. I know this book is not intended to be funny, but to me the poetry "It is poetry:thoughts" was just funny to me. I cannot give this book a fair rating because it is not a fair book. When will songwriter, actors, atheletes,models whatever! realize that just because they are good at one thing, doesn't mean that they are good at the other! God help the corporate/mainstream talent industry 
 I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.  At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.  A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.  I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that. 
   I was disappointed with the amount of 'foul language' in his sentences.  They were poorly written and researched.  Very amature in content and writting skills.  As far as content, he started out with very biased and critical view of the medical care in this county.  His answers are too simplistic and every thing in medicine will be solved by 'molecular imaging' technology.  The author did not explore detail with real 'foot soliders' of medicine in USA, i.e. Nurses, Doctors that really practice and care for patient day-in and day-out, not just someone in training and in the hospital staff on salaries like department head of radiology at Stanford University.     His focus was too much on money, but what can I expect from ex-wallstreet person.  He complains too much about how doctors and hospital made too much money, but reality is the author made money (more than $1 billion) worse way than these doctors.  I can't say he made his money honestly on wallstreet and he is complaining about doctors (i.e. ophthomologist) making a living with a trade they put years of educations to become competent.  He expects doctors not to make mistakes like if they are machines (even machines have error rate).  This kind of book promote more law suits in medicine, because he sets up unrealistic expectation on the public and CEO's of this country.  He never explore the cost of defensive medicine and its costs associated with medical care in this country 
 bloody horrible. I'm terribly disappointed. dear lord, terrible 
 I just purchased a set of two 4 channel Westinghouse intercoms and they worked only intermittently.  If I tipped one of the units, it worked sometimes, as though it had a bad connection.  I am trying to return them now to the seller.  Good luck if you purchase a set of these.  They seem to be hit or miss as to whether you get a good set 
 There are not many movies I have switched off after the first 30 minutes, but this is one of them, and I recommend you rent this one first before you buy or else you might have a nasty surprise 
 When the lead character acts like she's sleepwalking through the entire film, that's distracting! When just about anyone from my high school's drama class could do a much better job while brushing their teeth, then it's time to open up the wallet, and hire better talent.  Once you get past the special affects, all which use cheesy models, this godforsaken movie is boring as sin, or, should I say mud!   Beside being preposterous, for example, the meteroid, or whatever, ONLY hits a dam in its first strike, this pitiful film is also delusional! Remember the scene where the head of FEMA risks his life to save someone who is obviously in danger of being wiped out by fire. As Hurricane Katrinia proves, there is no such thing as a bureaucratic, administrator hero! Instead, this movie comes off as a piece of not-so-subtle Federal government propaganda not worthy of a moment of your time 
 This work on foraging theory is extremely weak on all aspects of foraging theory or ecology. I would recommend to interested individuals almost all other textbooks on foraging, most which are much more informative 
 Middle-aged Gracie is a typical Hollywood wife, right down to her botox injections and designer wardrobe.  When her husband dumps her after almost ten years of marriage, Gracie finds herself without love, without friends, and most importantly, without status.  (But at least she's still got the money!)  Actually, most of what I know is from the dust jacket since this book was too torturous to finish.  The plot is predictable and uninteresting and is littered with so much name-dropping that sometimes it's hard to follow.  The characters are taken straight from Stereotype 101 and are so badly written that they're impossible to relate to.  The writing is ponderous and lumbers along awkwardly, lacking polish, wit, or interest.  Especially irritating is Grazer's insistence on using Gracie's name as much as possible.  For example:  "Gracie thought about it; they'd never been to marriage counseling.  Gracie had gone to counseling in the beginning of their marriage - there were many issues to overcome.  More or less her personality issues - the fact that Gracie had too much personality.  Gracie said and did pretty much what Gracie pleased, in the beginning.  Before Gracie learned The Way of the Wife" (p 38).  I lost interest after about 20 pages, plowed my way through 40 more, then gave up.  It's very obvious that this is a poorly-veiled autobiography (Grazer/Gracie) and that as a Hollywood wife, Grazer DOES have the connections and clout her protagonist lacks or this book would never have been published.  Definitely not worth your time 
 Celebs using body suits to pretend they are pregnant while using surrogate mothers and claiming the babies were born the natural way. Also, celebs using body suits since they don't want to put any weight, favoring the now ultra thin mothers to be, those who lose the baby weight in less than a month.  Well it's a creative idea, as is Guatemalan week at Les Sprogs, the baby shop that Ruby and her posh cousin Stella manage; only Ruby is too tacky for Stella and she quits the partnership.  Dating a Gynecologist who delivers your 50 year old mom's newborn baby girl when you have 32 is also a creative take but the novel just didn't do it for me I was eager to put it down at any given moment when in reality when I am engrossed in a great read, I definitely cannot put the book down.  I would recommend it for people who have no other reading material and want to have 2 or 3 laughs. Just an OK book there's no other way to it. 
 This book is just awful. There are such biased misrepresentations of Christians and the Bible that it would be viewed as bigoted if it were aimed at any other group of people. The Bible is misquoted, taken out of context and generally misapplied. Anyone who chooses to use this as a classroom adjunct should first be mandated to study what the Scriptures really has to say 
 This book is just not funny. I tried hard to laugh, but it was just not funny. Anyway, it's a nice read.. so it doesn't deserve 1 star 
 Tha Dogg Pound - Cali Iz Active (KOCH, 2006)  And another entry in the long list of this year's disappointing albums from veterans is Tha Dogg Pound's Cali Iz Active. Kurupt and Daz still got that chemistry together, though; it's too bad that they're rapping like it's still 1992.  It's really a shame because in the 90's, Kurupt used to be really dope with his and Daz used to rhyme tight and produce tight jams. But on this album, Daz doesn't produce anything (which is already a one-star deduction) and his and Kurupt's rhymes are both uninspired. Overseer Snoop Dogg shows up a few times on here and though I can say the same about his deteriorated rhyme prowess, he steals the show from the Doggs. You can even look at the song titles and tell that this album would be unoriginal ("Sittin on 23z", "Keepin it Gangsta", etc.).  The saving graces on this album are productions by Battlecat (who is still severely underrated) and Soopafly (him too). Also, the Ice Cube-assisted "It's All Hood" adds some life to the party. "Fakina** H**s" featuring and produced by David Banner would also be good if the beat didn't sound like a rip-off of Jay-Z's "Dirt Off Your Shoulder".  If Cali is active, this album should not be proof. How did 2Pac say it? "All you old rappers tryin' to advance/It's all over now, take it like a man." -EJ 
 This one will help you go to sleep for sure. This is my second attempt at Ross MacDonald and I give up. Endings are a given, no surprises here 
 If you're looking for a book about the voyage of the Beagle and the development of Darwin's theories, this book is likely to disappoint. Written in an academic tone and with no sense of narrative, it's hard to believe the author won a Pulitzer Prize (different book). However, if you want to learn about buccaneers and the Galapagos Islands you will find more of the following: "At the time, buccaneers held a shifting status somewhere between adventurers and thieves. 
 With such wonderful illustrations, and a mostly enjoyable text, it's too bad that this book gets its inspiration from "Twas The Night Before Christmas". Jewish parents work hard teaching their children that Chanukah IS NOT the Jewish Christmas. This book doesn't help. There are much better choices out there 
 Kant is a genius; I give him that.  Still, his primary problem is that he presupposes in all his philosophy that there can be nothing beyond the natural and material world.  His aesthetics suffer as he tries to find a completely "objective" way of interpreting and appreciating the arts.  Not only does this not work in theory, but every human knows empirically that music, sunsets, and Monet are simply not capable of being interpreted completely void of feeling or pleasure 
 This printer does produce some fine output.  That is when it works.  The paper feed constantly refues to load paper.  The film scanner should have been left off all together (not worth using).  I have been looking everywhere for a recall on this unit (read ALOT of negative reviews).  I have been a long time HP fan, but after this experience I am going to look elsewhere. My advice is to NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS PRINTER 
 Looked nice and plain in the picture and it was on sale. Got it and was all doily and fru fru at the top. Gave it to a girl I know 
 This book is not a great value.  It does not explain German grammar with the clarity found in April Wilson's "German Quickly" or even Sandburg and Wendell's "German for Reading."  It is particularly weak when explaining prepositions and the extended adjective construction, and it does not give pragmatic advice about figuring out the various crucial elements in a German sentence.  Moreover, the exercise sentences are dull, and not worth the effort needed to translate them.  This book is a classic mainly because German teachers are too lazy to seek out substitutes 
 I wasn't that happy with the book. Seeing the personal post cards the Beatles sent to each other over the years seemed like a good concept. I guess it looked better on paper than reality. For one thing, there aren't many postcards.Two: They are just the average postcards anybody gets when someone travels, except more boring. Nothing more than "having fun, see you soon". That's about the whole lot of them. Each postcard has a one or two line Ringo quip about it. Sometimes they're interesting, mostly not. The only good thing about it is the fact that it was only $10.00 and some or all of the profits go to charity. Even a die hard Beatle fan won't find much to love about this book 
 The book has great pictures but no real detail about how to build ponds or waterfalls.  How disappointed we were when we received the book.  We will look for other books but will not purchase them online.  We need to be able to see what is inside the cover.  
 This book is average. My daughter doesn't really like it...nothing in the book catches her attention 
 The guy makes his liberal points like gangbusters. But why on earth is this type of material required reading in several colleges without an equally substantial pro-capitalist book to counter it?  Nowhere else in society are young people exposed to such raw indoctrination as they are in America's college campuses. Kids need to learn to think for themselves, not just repeat the rantings of their instructors.   
 My mother's mother was German and raved about this book. My mother bought it for me and my brother when we were quite young. It gave both of us nightmares. The scare-them-straight attitude of the book seems to say, "Look, your kids are too stupid to do what they're told. You have to scare them into behaving or who knows what they'll get into." I can picture a modern-day update of this book, "Hey, kids, don't play with guns or you'll wind up just like Billy who played with daddy's gun and blew his brains out. Here is a picture of Billy and his brains, before and after."  First of all, I think this kind of book would give bad kids more ideas on how to behave badly. For instance, the depiction of animal torture near the beginning of the book (I'm not kidding) might give kids in a two-story house ideas on exactly how to torture the family pet. Second, let's say the book does work, and teaches the kid that if he sucks his thumbs, he's going to get them amputated. Good job, mom and dad. Now your kid doesn't suck his thumbs any more, and he's completely traumatized because you showed him this book straight out of the enlightened Victorian age of parenting. One read-through of this book, and you're ready to send him to the work-house so he can earn his keep.  Apparently the individual who wrote this did so for his young son (He has my sympathy), because he believed that children's books at the time were "altogether too enlightened and rational, falsely naive, unchildlike, untruthful, artificial". Untruthful. As oppsed to in this author's book where it's "truthful" to depict a child as dying of starvation when refusing to eat for less than a week. I pity the children of any parents who mistakenly believe that this thing is suitable for children. It is tasteless, over-rated and iditiotic.  
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 I read this book after reading "The Wal-Mart Effect" (by Charles Fishman), and I immediately noticed that I didn't like the writing style in The Google Story (and trust me there was an extreme contrast between these books).  I think the title sums my aggravations up nicely: "The Google Story: Inside the Hottest Business, Media, and Technology Success of Our Time".  It seems to me that Vise is always trying to inflate the facts and turn them into some sort of sensational story (when he even bothers to use facts instead of a bunch of editorial).  Another thing that bugs me about this book is how Vise tries to inflate the "battle" between Microsoft and Google and make it sound like they are arch-rivals.  Google and Microsoft are operating in different spaces in the technology world currently.  Microsoft's bread and butter is Operating Systems, professional office software, IDEs, etc.  Google's bread and butter is advertising.  Sure, there might be a battle for the best corporate culture, but it's not like Microsoft releases Windows Vista and the Google team scrambles to release Google Earth 4.0 to show them up.  Vise also cites a speech given by Eric Schmidt at a school in Washington to illustrate this "battle" between companies.  I personally found Eric Schmidt's speech to be banal and irritating, and a mark against Google rather than for.  He sure did "attack Microsoft on their home ground", but how cool is that?  Schmidt pretty much acted like a jerk and tried to snatch up the best and brightest from a school in Microsoft's back yard so he could "flip the bird" to Steve Ballmer (who by the way is also a big jerk, so no big deal there).  But Vise makes it sound like it was some covert mission into enemy territory to make the world a better place.  As others have noted, there's no real wealth of "insider" knowledge on Google here.  I was hoping for a more technical book (e.g. I wanted more info on their clustering technology and less info on their investors).  He mentions that there was a fire that wiped out one of their data centers and their search engine coped with no problems.  How?  Doesn't it seem as if there would be a problem if a data center was taken out?  What about the search requests that were being processed by that data center at that time?  Still, I gave this book 2 stars.  Larry and Sergey were the saving grace, because their charisma and story somehow manages to shine (however dim or brief) through the pages of this book.  Because of that, I was able to get some value from this book.  But, I was able to derive value in spite of the author rather than because of the author 
 There are SOOOO many GREAT books about wicca out there I certainly wouldn't waste my money again on this book, and I suggest others don't either. It is a lot of pop propaganda made to make wicca and witchcraft look like something out of the movies. It is full of false information made just to look cute so it will sell, sell, sell. This book is not for anyone who is seriously interested in learning Wicca or witchcraft in general.  This supposedly "advanced" book doesnt go into details on how to make your spells better, how to connect with nature, how to beome stornger. It doesnt encourage deep thinking and lots of factual information. It DOES however make the reader feel like they can just read a spell out loud from the book and it will all work in a puff of blue smoke. This book is not about a different of opinions or different practices, it is about portraying a real, serious, religion as a fun and games, do whatever you want choice as she mixes in things in tradtional witchcraft that has been shown to have the oppsite and/or nagative effects, as well as doing spells which do not follow the Wiccan rede.  Even though I am not in a coven I understand wicca is a religious choice and like any religion there are beliefs and redes which are followed. It is not 'do whatever you want to do and call yourself wiccan'. Yes some things in religion are personal choices but the building blocks of the religion are totally lost on her. Freedom of choice in religion is wonderful and its everyones right but if your choice is to make up your own religion you should not go around saying your wiccan when you do not follow the wiccan ways, Unfortunatly that is EXACTLY what ravenwolf does. She doesn't differentiate between the Wiccan and Paganism, in fact she barely cover the topics at all giving vague rehashed information from her other books. This book seems a nice commercial, cutesy items to make everything pretty and oh so shiny. This book is teaching hype not truths.   This book is demeaning and disrespectful to anyone into witchcraft and wicca alike. There are many good books which put things in simple, pleasant terms without all the false, goofy information spread thoughout this book.  Go pick up another book on whatever your interst (wicca, witchcraft, or paganism) and you will undoubtably end up more informed, this book will just leave you feeling broke. 
 Ted Rall is a cartoonist and in way's we can say that he lives in a cartoon world. He very much wants to believe in the greatness of socialism, he wants to believe that everything good in this world has arrived from socialists and that everything bad comes from conservatives. Living a life like this is hard and causes one to make gross fabrications. To Mr. Rall superman, spider-man and wonder-women exist. But to us, slightly more well adjusted persons, we view these characters as fictionalized cartoons. Unfortunately Mr. Rall's book is that of cartoon-land so filled with these fabrications, that it really becomes a work of fiction.   It goes without saying that from the-1940's - 1980's, America was pulled brutally to the left. The Conservative Party was weak and simply capitulated to the powerful democrats. During the 1980's the American people realized this country's slide toward socialism, they also began to see that the policies were failing miserably to create the supposed utopia of the left. So starting from the 1980's to current day the pendulum has begun to swing back towards the center. The problem though is that the center now has been moved so far left that the republican party of today appear more like the democrat party of the 1960,s. In essence we do have a one party system, Socialist party A or Socialist Party B. But there are still some differences.   Rall doesn't quite understand that in our current situation, in which Democrats, whose domestic policy are carefully tailored to benefit a narrow socioeconomic segment of wealthy individuals, unions, lawyers and fringe special interest groups has become unpalatable to the average middle class American. Across the country, from California to New York, the hard leftist democratic candidates were unable to motivate their own base, let alone attract the center voters required to win close races. What Rall doesn't seem to get is that the Middle American doesn't view the Democrats as targeting the Republicans as opponents, instead the Democrats target America and the way of life that Middle America lives.  For example, Teddy has himself in an uproar because of GW's tax cuts "that favor the rich" Unfortunately this hard-left mantra just isn't true. Anybody who has simple cognitive skills can reed the CBO report that was produced at the request of congressional Democrats. It confirms that tax cuts since 2001 increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners. INCREASED!   It increased the share of federal income taxes paid by the highest earners, while decreasing the tax share of lower and middle-income groups.   Hello, automata on the left, are you paying attention, go back and read the CBO report about Clinton's draconian tax increase on the MIDDLE CLASS. It very clearly stated that lower and middle-income groups had their taxes RAISED disproportionately, while the top earners received little if any tax increase.   If you favor the middle class you have to vote republican, not for elitist billionaire candidates like Kerry, who would only hand out more favors to his fellow billionaires.   Ted and his ilk are so out of touch with the average Middle American that this doesn't make sense to him. They don't understand that people don't like being lied to. The biggest problem is that Ted believes that you can say whatever you want, this doesn't work anymore. With today's access to information you can show a lie so quickly it just doesn't make sense to say one.   For example, Ted lies about 2000 election on just about every count. First of all the state was called for gore 70 minutes before the polls closed in Florida. (Sorry Ted your lie that it was 10 minutes is patently false.) This early and fraudulent call was a concentrated effort by the liberal media to help disenfranchise the states voters. Democratic (yes, democratic) pollsters put the number of disenfranchised voters at between 10,000 - 15,000 that decided not to vote in the panhandle region. This, btw, is predominantly republican country.    But what is even more appalling is that the exit polling by all major news outlets was showing that Bush was winning. The extent to what liberals will do to swing the vote unethically in their favor is atrocious.  Gore's slide into win at any cost came quickly with his lawyers filling a petition to stop the counting of oversees military ballots. These ballots, btw, were never counted and added to the official total. Since most of them would have voted Bush and by counting the disenfranchised voters Bush easily won the state.   Now remember, the only reason the Supreme Court got involved was because the socialist state judges refused the follow the law. Gore only wanted the most liberal of all counties to be counted, but the state rules said all the counties had to be recounted. The first Supreme Court decision was 9-0 the second was 7-2, both of these decisions said in effect that the whole state had to be recounted. Ted's argument that the Supreme Court had no jurisdiction is merit-less, the presidential election is FEDERAL not a state election.  In the end the state recounted the ballots 4 different times and in all 4 Bush one.   Then a bunch of hard left media outlets got together at a cost of nearly $1 million bucks to try to PROVE that Gore won (NORC).  Cartoon-boy tells us that "Media Consortium Statewide Count of `Undervotes' and `Overvotes' Proves Gore Won Under Any Standard." (PAGE #)  This statement is blatantly, undeniable False, a big fat Lie and you can download the NORC document yourself. The NORC reports that they recounted all of the votes using 9 different methodologies. Bush won eight out of the nine and he won by a larger margin than was officially certified.  Sorry Cartoon-Boy your lies are great for the socialistic automata; for me I prefer to remain in the middle and support the truth. 
 I felt the book had highly unorganized content inside the chapters. The examples were vague and confused me further. It's more like a reference book than the text book which would explain the beginner Palm OS programmer the nuts and bolts of palm OS .I read the online docs for palm os4.0 sdk and found them much more informative than the book 
 These are indeed simple ideas--and hardly secrets.  If you have never thought about success in your own life, perhaps you may get something out of this book. But if seeking success and achievement is a part of your life this book will be nothing but dull for you.  The stories are not at all inspirational since they lack any real meat.  They were more like a set of facts which may have sometimes been derived from a really good story, but left me thinking "So what?".  The stories are too simple.  The "science" consists of a quick statistic.  E.g., "The productivity of employees who score high in dedication to their career is 33 percent less likely to be affected by the quality of their managers than is the production of low-dedicated employees."  So, in short, the points are trivial, the stories don't work, and the so-called science is presented in a way that is generally useless.  Very simplistic.  
 These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply 
 I think this is exactly the kind of textbook that should be distributed in abundance throughout all states wanting ID as part of their science curriculum. This will not only guarantee my two daughters a great deal less competition in medical school, it will also help fill the need for astute, critical thinkers in the food service industry.  An EXCELLENT BOOK! David/San Francisc 
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 I found this book sadly lacking in substance and quality activities. Spend your money on Days of Knights and Damsels by Carlson 
 The author mostly talks about how hard his training in the SEALS was.  What good does that do the normal person?  If anything, it makes your life seem simple and easy and that doesn't exactly motivate a person.  He introduces the book by saying that he'll give techniques to "unleash the warrior within" but all he does is present a simple idea like 'focus' and then talks about experiences in the SEALS.  The book isn't good as a motivational/training guide and it's not good as an informative piece on the SEALS.  It's a little of both and that makes it very weak (unless you're training for the SEALS and need to unleash your warrior within at the same time) 
 I decided on this item because I liked the idea of putting it in my cup holder and not having to worry about where to place my Sansa E250.  The MP3 player will sit nicely in the holder if you don't have a case on it, but I purchased the Speck ToughSkin which makes the player thicker.  Luckily you can pull off a cheap plastic template piece and still use it with a case, but it won't hold it very securely and it would pop off once in a while when I hit a big bump.  This thing worked great for a few weeks, great sound.  Then one day I tried to turn it on and it wouldn't power on.  I checked all the plugs, but it still wouldn't work.  I sent it back and am going to try the FM transmitter from Maximo.  I probably just got a dud, but they lost my trust 
 A typical teen/early-twenties movie juxtaposing moments of characters being fun slacker caricatures, and moments where their humanity comes through. It's not about the rave scene, that's just the setting. It's about people, and the people in this slow-paced movie aren't very interesting. Their emotional issues didn't engage my interest or sympathy, and the fun scenes didn't make me wish I was there. Movies that did the same thing better include Dazed And Confused, Suburbia, Spun, The Party Monster, Empire Records, and even Go.  
 While this book is a good attempt at placing statistical topics necessary to toxicology in one spot, the mistakes are inexcusable.  Many formula are incorrect as well as text referring to the wrong tables or data. Therefore, one begins to lose trust in the information presented.  Be careful if you use this book 
 I have read 2 other chem book and found this book is my least favorite. 
 I bought this to connect via 1/8" Monster patch cable directly to my CD player. There is a ton of static and line noise introduced when using it this way. If I could give it zero stars, I would! Avoid! 
 This film pulls together all of the arguments in favor of wal-mart.  There is also a very interesting conclusion on the undeniable good work that the company did in summer 2005 in the Katrina-ravaged regions.  However, none of the legitimate concerns of critics are given any thoughtful review.  I say this as a concerned conservative, who wants to understand the enormous changes occuring in my country, and not a liberal.  On the plus side, it is hard to argue against the business model of wal-mart:  it offers everyday low prices, which the company accomplishes by incredible and continual productivity gains - by some measures wal-mart is responsible for 25% of the productivity gains in the US due to its use of new technologies! - as well as vast scale economies in particular with globalisation.  Regardless of what critics say, these factors are the basis of the company's success:  consumers chose to buy there because of the prices and convenience.  However, this is the point when the film becomes disingenuous.  Anything that critics say is summarily dismissed by either a single and simplistic example, by some self-appoined talking head, by employees who like their jobs, or simply by people passing by on the street.  I found this pathetically unconvincing.   For example, because wal-mart is criticised as a destructive force against traditional town centers, the filmmakers find one town that was able to renew itself as a tourist spot with boutiquie stores and then assumes that that can happen everywhere (but the site was in the Blue Mountains, not in the Oklahoma dustbowl).  No statistics are offered, no additional proof, and no counter-arguments are acknowledged.     Moreover, it is easy to find people to spout the opinion you want to espouse by looking for them - to be sure, wal-mart critics do the same, but there are some critics who act like journalists and try to see what truth there is in the arguments advanced.  This film does not.   At one point, the filmakers interview a group of teenagers who state wal-mart wages would  "enough" for them (none of them work there), as if that refutes the experience of single mothers trying to make ends meet on wal-mart salaries!  They also get a few people to state that they never get asked to work overtime wothout pay as if that eliminates the need to investigate the claims of thousands of others who are winning multi-million dollar class-action lawsuits against that practice in their wal-marts.  Finally, some of the talking heads make the most ridiculous arguments.  One of them dismissed all the arguments of critics who charge that wal-mart urges its workers to use the welfare system as "those who advocate government health care anyway" - as if that negates their arguments!  By glossing over the details, they don't even make the case in  favor of the wal-mart business model all that well, let alone consider how the intallation of a wal-mart impacts entire communities.  As such, this film is for the convinced, for those who want to have their opinions reinforced rather than challenged.  That makes it like Fox news at its worst:  you know what you are going to get before you switch it on - pure opinion and little reporting - so why bother?  It isn't for learning.  The costs behind wal-mart's methods are not even open to question.  The one thing I took away from this is the sincerity of some of the employees, who genuinely believed in the company.    Overall, I cannot recommend this film, except as a pure ideological view in favor of this controversial company.   This doesn't do anyone any good - there is no chance for dialogue in this approach, no acknowledgment that critics can make legitimate points.  Whether powerful companies like it or not, they do not automatically deserve our trust, but instead our critical and constant scrutiny

 We got this set for my 4 year old son for Christmas. His eyes lit up when he saw it. He dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away....we didn't, of course...we waited a whole day...thank goodness...it literally took an hour to put together. There are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different. It was very frustrating...then it wouldn't stay together once it was finished. It has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since. He gets so upset when he tries to play with it. We saved the box. It's going back, if they will take it... 
 I have the Laser Disc version of this film along with the special features.  I bought the DVD for convenience sake.  But, this pressing is not in the same league.  The DVD is not so sharp visually (which I could live with) but the sound track is terribly distorted.  In particular the choral numbers are unlistenable.  Even the two serving maids who sing along with Eliza's "I could have danced...etc" are distorted.  With all the advanced technology available to modern pressing plants, is this the best they could do?  I have many vintage film musicals and a large collection of older opera performances which have now been released on DVD and this "My Fair Lady" is easily the worst as far as sound is concerned. 
 I purchased this movie based upon the reviews and recommendations from others on Amazon.com who ( I assumed ) had watched it and liked it.  Not knowing the titles or directors of good erotica, I based my decision on those comments.  I have to say, and I'm usually NOT one to go off griping about things that don't deliver on their "advertised" qualities, but this was by far and without a doubt the WORST movie of ANY category I have ever seen.  I considered selling it on e-bay just to recover some of the cost, but I refuse to subject any poor unsuspecting man (or woman) to this garbage.  If you're looking for something to set the --mood-- this movie will NOT do it 
 Despite its' title, this book (wide page margins and large type actually make it a distended pamphlet) is only incidentally about Pope Pius XII.  Its' real purpose is to set Roman Catholics and Muslims at each others throats, and to lead Catholics to support any and all actions taken by the Israeli government against Palestinians living within Israeli-occupied territory.  It tries to accomplish this by tarring all Arabs (and by implication, all Muslims) as subhuman beasts.  Throughout this noisome tract, Arabs--wherever and whenever found--are relentlessly portrayed as the exact equivalent to Nazis and vice-versa.  This technique scarcely differs from that of crude anti-Jewish screeds that go from noting that Karl Marx and the Rosenbergs were Jews, to claiming that Jews and Communists are one and the same.  Pius is used merely as a foil to a contemporary, the notorious Nazi-sympathizer, Haji Amin al-Hussaini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem.  Considering what a low basis for comparison this is, one hopes that at least some Catholics will take offense at the Pope being dragged alongside such a grotesque figure.  Not a trace of original research or primary sources besmirch these pristine pages.  Instead, the book deliberately conflates two separate and highly emotive issues which will be untangled here.  1.) Pope Pius XII, the Holocaust, and the Jews:  For whatever it is worth, this reviewer believes Pius was caught in an almost impossible situation.  Not only was there legitimate concern that more forceful denunciations of Nazi genocide might backfire; the Pope himself stood in danger of kidnap, capture or murder.  Hitler certainly would not have had the least compunction about such methods; a head of state such as deposed Austrian Prime Minister Kurt von Schuschnigg was imprisoned in a concentration camp until the end of the war, barely escaping execution at the last.    Questions concerning Pius' precise actions during the war have now been thoroughly muddled and muddied by sloppy research, overstatement, and much venom squirted by both Pius' extreme critics and extreme defenders (this book very definitely included).  A recent scrupulously fair and rigidly factual examination of these matters is "Pius XII and the Holocaust: Understanding the Controversy"  by  historian Jose M. Sanchez (available from Amazon).  Regrettably, it will probably be ignored.  Everyone seems bent on finding another prosecutor's charge sheet or defense attorney's brief to augment their pre-fab opinions.  2.) Israel, the Arab States, and the Palestinians:  By now, the struggle between (and within) these groups has become so poisonous, archangels with Ph.D.'s in International Relations would be hard pressed to come up with a solution to the conflict all sides could accept.  To bitter partisans on either side equipped with guns, bombs, microphones, or pens; no falsehood is too gross, no libel too base, and no tactic too vile.  By contrast, Catholics (as well as Christians generally) have a Just War tradition against which all sides are to be judged.  Hopefully, this ugly attempt to further poison the wells of controversy will be seen for what it is.    Perhaps the author should be congratulated; he has managed to becloud and envenom not just one, but two hotly contested topics in 256 brief pages.  Nazi propagandists called this tactic `zersetzung' (literally: decomposition).  How curious to find a rabbi resorting to it 
 El producto es de muy bajas caracteristicas.

 Dr. Gullo has quite a few good ideas here.  My problem is, #1, most of them are already in "Thin Tastes Better"; and #2, the book is blatantly padded, which drives me nuts. The useful material could be condensed down to about 30 pages -- so, to make the book long enough, he repeats every idea about 30 times.  He mentions the GG Bran Crispbread on literally every page... which brings me to annoyance #3:  as other reviewers have suggested, most of his recommended foods are nearly impossible to find.  Absolutely NO ONE in my area carries the bran crispbread; I finally mail-ordered some, only to discover that it's barely edible -- it tastes like thin sheets of wood.  It's bearable if topped with something, but really awful eaten plain.  Take my advice and forget about it -- just get yourself some Ry-Krisp, Finn Crisp or even reduced-fat Triscuits (my staple!).  I finally found Fage yogurt, and it's very expensive ($1.99 for an individual 7-8 oz. cup) -- AND it's only available in either fat-free (which I don't like) or very high fat (250 calories per 8 oz).  I did find Walden Farms salad dressings, but when I saw that they're labeled "Calorie Free," I decided they would probably be vile-tasting and put them back on the shelf.  I also found Vitamuffins, but if you read the ingredient lists, they are NOT particularly healthy:  the top three ingredients in their "Cran-Bran Muffins" are water, sugar, and white flour!  Bran is way down the list, and the fiber content is not high.  So I didn't buy those either.  I was glad to know that Alba shakes are still being made, although again, you have to mail-order them.    Dr. G. does have good behavior modification suggestions.  I think he's absolutely on the money about "trigger foods" and always carrying a snack pack with you.  But again, I believe all of that is in "Thin Tastes Better." 
 I'm amazed that a movie this bad can be made in 21st century. To classify the performance as acting reduces the art to begging in the street. We just tried to watch the movie with some friends but had to turn it off and throw it in thrash. Please don't buy so movie this bad not get made again 
 Sorry...it's not what I expected. I kept thinking, "where is this going???" It just wasn't funny. It reminded me of something written 100 years ago. But that's not to say someone familiar with Portuguese linguistics (maybe a German academist or an up-in-coming Dr. Dr. Longname, etc. etc. hrumph, cough), could not read between the lines and find this humorous...it was just a little dry and boring to me. After the first couple jabs at these pompous doctors, it got tiring. I read every single book in the Ladies Detective series and couldn't wait to sink my teeth into the next Precious Ramotswe story. This, however, was a disappointment. I'm only sorry I bought all 3 in the series, sight unseen, based on the other books I'd read by Alexander McCall Smith 
 I am a Navy Wife of four years facing my first deployment as a wife and I found this book to be the corniest thing I've ever read. EVER.  The "comical" stories everyone seems to be gushing over sound like they were pulled right out of a dusty old Reader's Digest. I didn't find the book to be informative and I found the definition section of the book to be incredibly trite and boring.   Example: Term Active Duty, Military Speak: Actively serving and deployable. Spouse Speak: This means your address is written in pencil in address books.  Dear God. How incredibly lame. Military members move. Yes. It's true. We ALL know that. Civilians know this. EVERYONE knows this. This poor attempt at humor is dull and over-used.  I didn't learn ANYTHING from this book and would NOT recommend this to anyone  SERIOUSLY looking for information or advice about military life or deployments. You can get USEFUL information by going to your local Fleet and Family Support Center or attending a pre-deployment brief. 
 I tried to install at my house with only 20 feet range but I was getting static noise.  Only way I could make it work was by disconnecting our 2.4GHz cordless telephone (Panasonic) unit.  I tried to contact the customer service but nobody are answering the phone.  I was on hold for 30 minutes twice and it was answered by a voice mailbox 
 Perhaps I had been expecting a true sequeal to the original. I was so excited when I saw the book but instead of a taut, touching tale I got a rambling, frequently boring, difficult to follow story that I had to force myself to finish.  It seemed more a tale of politics and religious infighting than a science fiction story.  Problems?  How about WAY too many characters, many with multiple names. I consider myself intelligent and widely read but the rush of people created such a flux that the plot seemed almost secondary.  I liked the hero but for all his potential he did little more than whine, worry and wonder.  His boss, the antipope, became the star of the show along with the swordsman.    The story did not "flow" and bogged down several times in minor details.  The first section covereding the time in the abbey passed uneventfully but for a few personal crises. Then we journey toward the conclave and are introduced to host of new folks.  Finally we arrive in the city and meet yet another cast of characters.  The story was as much about Native American culture as anything.  The language issues, interesting at first, became tiresome as we switched from various dialects (some almost unpronouncable with special symbols) to Latin (frequently) to English.  All in all, not a success 
 There appear to be at least 3 different versions of this DVD for sale on Amazon, each with a different price. Some reviews say the video quality is good, some say it is terrible.  It would be helpful if Amazon would indicate which version of this movie each review is associated with so that customers could decide which one to choose 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 So...I bought this for our 7 month old.  What a nightmare.  What the previous posters said about this thing is TRUE.  It is hard to get it to STAY PUT in the cart while you put your kid in it. It just doesn't happen.  And then...when you DO get your baby in, the seat portion is so narrow that it barely is the width of your child's hind end.  Forget the bar cover.  It is just as narrow.  This thing covers just that small area and if you have a child like mine, they are reaching over and touching EVERYTHING.  To add to it, the back cusion part doesn't even go up to the top of the back support.  My daughter totally whacked her head on the back of the cart seat and screamed.  The cusion part totally doesn't cover it.    Just bad.  Just spend the extra cash and buy something that covers the whole darn cart 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I, guess, as a musician I was hoping for more emphasis on music and not twelve pages on bathing, showering, shaving, putting on underwear...well, you get the idea.  It's the first Reading Rainbow book I have not liked at all.  I had planned to give this to a friend's children but I defintely will not 
 This pair of authors has no credibility in the Vajrayana community, mostly because they just make it up as they go along. Publishing books like this is their way of making money and trying to gain credibility. (If Shambhala publishes us, we're as legit as anyone else Shambhala publishes, right?)  Um, no.  If you are interested in the specific topics Chogyam and "consort" flail away at in this volume, see Magic Dance by Thinley Norbu. His book is much shorter, because he knows what he's talking about and he's not just inventing nonsense.  Interested in Tantric Buddhism generally?  See Gates to Buddhist Practice, by Chagdud Tulku, and The Buddha from Dolpo by Cyrus Stearns. Or anything by Chogyam Trungpa.  One may assume my aversion to this "teaching" is a symptom of a generalized aversion to "controversial teachers." Hardly.  The trouble with Aro gTer? Their controversial leaders aren't teachers at all 
 Senator Obama is an engaging speaker and has potential to be a leader, but this book doesn't offer any new insights or solutions to the political climate we have today in the USA.  Nicely written but the next book will tell whether he can avoid the decline into standard partisan behavior now that the Dems are in charge of Congress.  Time will tell 
 Hamburg obviously writes for a different genre, allegedly screenwriting. And while ascribing himself much credit, his prose falls largely flat. Many of the sentences read on a basic level, a recitation of his accomplishments, marginal people he met, and esoteric details that are painful to dig through. For the Stone fan, an interesting read, for the average person, it has its moments. But its material, and its potential, is so much greater than what Hamburg delivers. For all the material possible, the book delivers flat. It's not worth the money and not really worth the time. It often reads as Hamburg's diary entries, with most chapters being a scant three or four pages, rather than a real story about great opportunities and fascinating characters. Hamburg is also a constant name-dropper, for almost no discernable reason. It seemed as though Hamburg's insights were immature, overwrought, and full of snide commentary and self promotion. It's no coincidence that his career centers on the two parts of the country that hype both: Hollywood and Washington 
 So of the 22 tracks almost half are skits. What is the deal with skits. Almost every rapper has atleast one track that is just a retarded recording of them being drunk, high or just acting dumb. Do the people who buy this record realize the are paying $13.00 or more on 10 tracks of music (i am using music losely) Who thinks these skits are even entertaining, I know I don't. Yet again the YYT have concocted another perverted cd thats only purpose makes for good club beats but as usual the lyrics suck. Not suprising. 
 To the reviewer who thinks these are the originals, I "just want you to know" (lol) that this is NOT the original "Take It Easy On Me".  I have the first greatest hits album and it's awesome.  I've listened to those songs over and over and I can tell just from this sound clip that it's not the same version.  Listen to the phrasing and the way the singer holds the notes when he sings "I'm getting lost in the crowd" and it's TOTALLY obvious.  What a disgrace.    I also agree with the reviewer who commented on the change in the order...it was perfect before.  I knew the song "Cool Change" from when it was originally released, but hearing it on the first greatest hits album, as the finale, really made me appreciate what an amazing song it is...now my absolute favorite by LRB.  Again...disgraceful.  I will admit that I DO NOT own this CD, but I gave it a low rating because I am disgusted by what they've done to this great compilation.  And, from a completely different point of view, let's pretend that this re-release isn't a total debacle...let's say it was a fantastic re-do.  It's REALLY annoying to those of us who bought the original greatest hits to have one that would now be outdated...have the decency to rename it or, at the very least, change the album cover!!!  A wag of the finger to you! 
 The most frequent advice the author seems to give, is "Take a sabbatical". Iberra ofers little advice for the person who is ready for change, but simply can't afford to make it. If you make less than six figures a year, you'll find yourself asking "Uh... what am I going to eat while I do that?".     Beyind this, though, the book does deal with how to emotionally navigate the hurdles of being "between two worlds" while changing careers, so it's not a total loss.     Myself, I find that I fell into a career track that I never wanted, and know I want out. I need the financial and navigational help to move back towards where I wanted to be originally, or find something new. This book doesn't provide that, as much as the emotional support needed to convince yourself you really have chosen the wrong path.    If you're wealthy, this book will work for you. If not, you may want to look for another one, as this one has some items of use for you, but you'll have to work to find them 
 This is nonsense. Who really cares to hear every lame ass detail of this "has-been's" life? Not i sir, not i 
 Sat down and saw this one on televion.  Only good service was that now I know buying the DVD would be a waste of money.  What was actually achieved by the British is portrayed as an American achievement. Slanders the U-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders. Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats.   The movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and  unrealistic. Action scenes unbelievable. Characters Two Dimensional.   This film Awful. 
 The under read writers in this anthology should be very grateful for Peter Jackson, the director of Bad Taste whose studio franchise benefits them. But Tolkien would have found little to admire here, consider Ursula Leguin a feminist academic bandied about in the political science department at U.C. Berkley and editor of The Oxford Book of Science Fiction, which is just a collection leftist propaganda. Tolkien who disliked newspapers and barely ever read them would have found the hyper contemporizing mis-readings here incomprehensible 
 A very talented author strays out of his comfort zone, and the results are lousy. Paper-thin characters, implausible plot - in short, a waste of time. All his books before this one, however, I'd highly recommend. 
 There is actually a lot of interesting historical information for the right-of-center reader who wants to learn about the right-wing/Republican successes in bolstering its face time in the American media.   But it's a tough read because Brock is obviously extremely skeptical of pretty much everything that comes out of the mouth of anyone who votes Republican.   Brock hurts his credibility early on when he states flat out that his early conservative writings were actually literary regurgitations of the right wing party line. But what's to keep a reader from viewing this book as just a left-wing version of the same?  I think he could have balanced the book by discussing more specific left-of-center successes. Whenever he does mention the left-wing in the media, it's usually in lofty platitudes about their objectivity and non-partisanship (trust me, Brock really believes this).   He seems to think the left-wing is totally helpless in the face of the right-wing media juggernaut. Does anyone in America actually believe that?  This book has the potential to be an informative read (it's over 400 pages), but it too often lapses into name calling, unsubstantiated generalizations, and conspiratorial excess.   Leave the wild rhetoric to Michael Moore and just give us the facts 
 This book has been summarized already by previous reviewers, so I won't rehash that. I agree with the reader from Austin that this book was very disappointing. To me, it seemed as if Shattuck couldn't decide whether the book should be literary criticism or historical overview or a chance for him to air out his morals. He tried to do all three at once, resulting in a bit of a mess. He kept switching back and forth between objective history lesson and subjective moralizing to the point where the points he professed to be trying to make became somewhat lost and pointless. The objective bits were dry and boring and the moralizing was condescending and annoying and insulting to the reader 
 may god have mercy upon this poor excuse for a mans sou 
 This film is as mildly interesting as listening to Zamfir alongside the continent of Australia can be... As for the enemic story, we are in the realm of the Victorian repressed-sexuality genre. One shot explains much of the film: pan over the silent magnificence of unknown nature, RACK FOCUS to an old buttoned up lady reading geometry. Weir thinks he's getting away with this minimalist pablum but it's just a bore. Nicholas Roeg explored somewhat similar territory with much more success in his film Walkabout 
 I was excited to find a crockpot cookbook that didn't have lots of recipes with cream of mushroom soup in them.  Some recipes are written more clearly than others.  Some have a range for how long you should cook stuff instead of a particular number.    I tried 3 recipes.  First was a Rosemary Chicken recipe which cooked the chicken too long and dried it out.  Then I tried a macaroni and cheese recipe which burnt.  Finally I tried a recipe for chicken with soy sauce and honey which once again was dried out.  The seasonings were good and some of the recipes were pretty unique, hence the 2 star rating.  I followed the directions to the letter and even had the same size crockpot which they mentioned in the recipe!  So if you choose to use this book, watch the food VERY CLOSELY 
 Yikes!  I am newly engaged, and this book scared the bejebbers out of me!  My fiance and I were looking at a simple wedding.  This book intends to scare you into looking at more and more elaborate proceedings.  Finally, you are at the point where you believe no one but a diety called a "wedding planner" can actually pull off a wedding.    Perhaps it is where I live and my social-economic class, but this book view of etiquette is manners that quickly translates into cash.  I literally woke up in the middle of the night when I considered how much everything would cost and how far behind the wedding planning was.    My friends who are married knew what sort of wedding I had in mind and did not hestitate to tell me to send the book BACK.  
 I am a big fan of Rita Ciresi, so I went out of my way to find this one. This was her first literary work, a collection of short stories. It is just plain weird, and darkly sad. Awfully written. I can't imagine how it won the Flannery O'Connor award. Rita Ciresi's other books, especially Pink Slip and Blue Italian are so much better. I've been trying to unload this on ebay for a long time now and no one will buy it from me. Can't say I blame them 
 I got this product for my daughter.  The password feature was difficult to program and the voice recognition was so precise it was almost impossible to reproduce the right voice inflection and pattern for the journal to recognize.  My daughter often could not make the journal open. After a frunstrating week or two, she stopped playing with it altogether 
 Don't get me wrong, I love Brian Stokes Mitchell. His deep voice is intoxicating and beautiful, which was why this CD was such a dissapointment. All his songs are high and do not show off his wonderful low voice. Mitchell should stick to what he does best and it is not covers of songs made for tenors. I hope his next album will be more fit for his voice, I'll be the first in line 
 In the wake of corporate scandals, David Callahan decided to look into cheating in America.  What he discovered was the cheating has become part of our social structure. He attributes this to the intense pressure that society puts on us to succeed.  Since many high profile people cheat and are not caught (and if they do the penalty is low), many other people begin to cheat because they feel that they have to stay at the same level as others.  This causes cheating behavior to "trickle-down" until it almost become socially acceptable.  He even mentions how people begin to cheat at a young age in school, and when they do not get caught, they continue to cheat throughout their lives because they see the benefits are greater than the chance of getting caught and being punished.  Additionally, he says how many people cheat even when they do not recognize their behavior as cheating, such as when they steal cable or download music for free.  This book is based on a good idea, and Callahan does give many real world examples.  The major downfall of the book is that with every example he reaches the same conclusion, which is more or less, what I described above.  After reading this for a couple hundred pages, it becomes redundant and mind numbing.  By the time you reach the chapter on how to solve the problem, you already know what his solution is because he repeats it throughout the book.  I feel that this book would have been a lot better if it were only half as long.   
 The Left Behind series is the best reading I have ever read. I admit my reading is not all that much, but when I read the very first book I was hooked, I read all twelve books in about six weeks. They lead me to understand the Bible better. Thank you Tim and Jerry for such great books.       Corrine Robinson    
 I have never been so frustrated with a toy!  The instructions are not only hard to read but wrong!  You get better instructions if you go to the Alex toys website, so just throw the instructions away that come with the toy.  You waste alot of material with this toy, it seems to be designed that way, so you better purchase extra sticker material when you buy the toy.  It jams extremely easily so a child should not play with this awful toy alone.  
 Well, nice cinematography as set-designer work: nicely interiors and well dressed actors. Maybe, visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once, but not enough to consider it as a remarkable  movie of year, as other reviewers trying to assure 
 The EN-EL3a is a works fine and with no problems.  HOWEVER, AMAZON IS MISLEADING ITS CUSTOMERS BY PUTTING A LOWER PRICE FROM A PARTNER COMPANY AS THE PRIMARY PRICE OF THE ITEM.  Amazon should market the item at it's price and show the partner price as an option unless the item can only be obtained from the partner.  The 2 stars is not for the item but for amazon's misleading advertisment 
 The only reason why I finished this book is because I held out hope (even till the last 10 pages) that the entire 600 pages would actually explain what the whole "Game" and "secret" was (because there was no POINT to the entire plot - it was almost like 5 year-olds in a sandbox seeing who could collect the most lego pieces, except this was a really really big sandbox), and would have somehow been worth my time. No such luck 
 some idiot edited this and put two bars on the top and bottom that are part of the video so in you watch this on a laptop or widescreen tv you will also get two bars on this side.  this means that when you view it, it takes up about 25-35% of the screen with four black bars taking up most of the screen.  i could not even watch 5 minutes of this.  complete trash. 
 Anita Shreve is pushing an agenda, but not necessarily a moral one.  Yes, Fortune Rocks contains many truthes...teenaged mothers shouldn't be ostracized from society, and are still people worthy of love, but ultimately the book tries to make adultery acceptable.  This book depressed me.  Not only because Shreve never admits that most of the suffering could've been averted by different (and wiser) choices, but because her amoral thinking is cleverly couched between truthes and half-truthes.  I also hate reading books that make hot, infatuation sex the highest possible endeavor in life, and that all else (especially a good marriage and children) should be sacrificed for it. 
 In 5th grade my reading group was assigned this book. We all hated it because Gilly was an obnoxious, snotty brat. We spent most of our work time drawing comics in which she crawled out of the school toilets and attacked us, and we had to fight back and defeat the evil Gilly. So if you want your kids to waste time, buy this book; if you actually want them to read something meaningful and enjoyable, look elsewhere.  However, I do have to say that we weren't at all shocked or corrupted by the language. Kids learn that stuff anyway 
 I was looking forward to get the massager, which I was for a while searching. But I regret to inform you that I could use this item for only 2 times @ 15 minutes. After the it didn't work. (the light on the adapter do not work) I'm glad that I can express this. 
 I just want to say, do not judge the author by this book.  I loved Ugly Duckling and many of her romance novels, but this one was terrible.  The hero of the novel starts out being strong and interesting, but for no aparent reason turns into a spineless idiot.  Bess, the heroine, acted like a selfish, hypocritical child and was never once brought to task for her stupidity.  She spends half of the novel blaming Kaldack for risking her life for the good of many, but spends the entire novel risking not only herself but everyone else for more selfish motives.  As the bodies pile up as a result of her actions, she never acknowledges any culpability.  I completely agree with every bad review that has been written 
 I was looking for a compass to put on my daughters bike and bought a couple of these.  It does not work very well wether it is on the bike or away from the bike 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 I found the book thought-provoking, but there is more to philosophy than provocation. The common underlying argument of this book, and its only valid statement as ethics, is that since the only purpose of ethics is to regulate human behavior, the ethics society adopts should reflect the kind of society we want to live in. This results-oriented approach is all very well, but Singer doesn't really build upon it through any legitimate philosophical argument. Virtually all of Singer's arguments about particular issues rest upon emotional premises that the reader either does or does not accept. If you accept the premise you are likely to find at least some merit in the argument; if you don't accept the premise, its impossible to follow along to any useful conclusion. In short, these are not ethical writings but the political writings of someone who is too smart for standard political discourse and not interested in limiting his thoughts to philsophy as a discipline. How useful you find this is up to you. I personally don't know Singer from Adam and had not received any prior indoctrination about how groundbreaking he was before I picked up the book; as a result, I have trouble seeing what people are so excited about 
 Terry Pratchett's only written four bad books of which I am aware. This, I suppose, is a sign of genius -- when your work is so consistently good that a small slip-up is so glaringly obvious. It doesn't help Carpe Jugulum, though.  The Witches are the least interesting of Pratchett's sub-worlds, since Granny Weatherwax is simply too confident and sure of herself for us to really believe that anything can threaten her. Her cohorts are simply not as funny or interesting as Death's family, the University Wizards, or the Night Watch.  The storyline here is also something we've seen many times before; something strange and modern is invading the Discworld, and the native forces have to oppose it. In this case, the threat is a bunch of vampires who play by modern rules instead of traditional; they like garlic, they ignore holy symbols, and so forth. The Witches mobilize to oppose them using a combination of clever tricks (which don't really make sense) and blind optimism (basically just hoping something lucky will happen). The subplots involve the arrival of an Omnian revivalist in Lancre, some strange avian life, and a bit more of the fairy-tale cliché from Witches Abroad; none of these subplots actually go anywhere.  Really, this is the exact same plot as Lords and Ladies, but not as well executed. It's still not Pratchett's worst (that's hands-down Fifth Elephant) but it's certainly nearly as much fun to read as his other works 
 Too bad that the last of the Ripley books was a bit of a let-down.  A great set up and interesting premise, the book is marred by its poor resolution.  What potential - two vulgar Americans who become Ripley's neighbors with a hidden agenda...the "cat and mouse" of this book should have been great, but sadly it falls short.  In my opinion, Ripley's Game is the best of the Ripley sequels - this one doesn't even come close.. 
 Scraping and processing the web for data is increasingly interesting to blooming social scientists.  With the availability of the BeautifulSoup library, these occasional programmers are now able to slice & dice HTML with regular expressions.  But they shouldn't use this book to help them scrape the data from the Internet.  Reading this book and using its examples, one might conclude that cookies don't exist on the Web.  If you're looking for solid Web examples or networking example code, don't look here.  This section of the book is in need of a re-tune
