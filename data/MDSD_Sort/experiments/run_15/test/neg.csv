 This may be the worse movie ever made.  The plot is pretty lame and the movie itself is boring.  Basically nothing happens during the entire movie.   If I could give this zero stars I would 
 This book was a major disappointment.  If books could be returned for a full refund because of disappointment with the contents, then I would immediately return this one.  I liked the title and I am a fan of both Ali and Frazier and I was interested in reading more about their great third fight.  Plenty is written about Ali, but I was interested in reading and learning more about Frazier.  Well, 90% is about Ali and race.  6% is about Frazier and only 4% is about the fights themselves, including the third fight that the book is based on!  This book could have been a short magazine article, instead it is needlessly expanded.  I only finished this book because I paid full price for it and I knew that I couldn't get my money back 
 This book is a waste of money. I received it as a gift so I couldn't return it. It is full of historical mistakes and careless errors. It is not  worth taking the time to point them out 
 My cousin bought this for my daughter thinking she would have hours of fun making braclets and necklaces. However, she can not even use the gift.  You need to buy the Totally Beadifully Jewelry Maker to use this kit.  No where in the online description of this toy on Amazon does it tell you this.  Toy is being returned b/c we don't have the bead maker 
 It was the wrong cable and did not even fit the Garmin!  I phoned Garmin and they said they will send a replacement out.  Hopefully when it gets here it wil be the correct cable 
 This book claims to be written in a large font, however the font is barely larger than the paperback edition.  The large print edition is at most 2 points larger than the paperback, maybe a 12 or 13 point font.  What makes this book bigger is the extra space at the bottom of the page which is not all that usefull for making notes.  This edition is poorly laid out for enjoyable reading and useful notation.  Don't waste you money to get this so called "large print" edition, you should probably just buy the regular sized one.  
 This book is far from believable. But never the less a good read. I was able to put it down and took a few days to read it, instead of my normal one to two days. She starts plot lines and does not follow through on them. And the flow of time from chapter to chapter is very erratic.   The first chapter of this book is very well written. There is a wonderful depiction of village life in tribal India. I felt as if I was there. It makes you want to read the rest of the book.  But this level of writing is not carried through. I also found that the quick glimpse of high tech computer firms corporate backstabbing was very accurate. And the choices they make on whom to fire and keep was right on target. It made me remember why I retired from the work force before I was at the age of forty without any regret and never looked back.  The book does have romance and intrigue. But, the characters are too atypical and our heroine is too perfect. The author does try to let us into the view of a bicultural heritage in today's world. She just seemed to not know how to show is the journey. 
 This book has an "I" problem.  The Judge repeatedly uses "I" did..., "I" thought..., "I" knew ..., "I"....  It seems egotistical, judgmental - and paranoid.  We have experienced the whole thing, first hand...he puts a lot of spins on the truth!  Christian love doesn't do things this way 
 This is a kids book. First few had my attention but since then its getting worse with each book. 
 I found this book to not only be shallow and poorly written, but also insidiously demeaning to women. Rather than focusing on the individual strengths and weaknesses men and women bring to relationships, the author focused on the weakness and instability of women. In addition, his examples and analogies were often misplaced and poorly devised... certainly not illustrative of his points or of a healthy marriage. I found the content much too general with overuse of stereotypes. My fiancee and I have read Chapman's Five Love Languages and got a great deal more out of that exercise 
 The Onkyo TX-8522 receiver lasted less than one month. I purchased it to replace a Fisher receiver I have had for 36+ years. Thought it was time to replace it. While listening to one of my favorite jazz tunes this new Onkyo receiver sparked - followed by the smell of a burning resistor. Needless to say I put my 36+ year old Fisher receiver back in service and continued listening to my favorite jazz tunes. They just don't make them like they use to. More to follow pending the results of the repair 
 A to much classical style for my taste. There is an extreme rigour, out of date nowadays. Besides, it presents few photos and hands and feet are forgotten! 
 I was inspired to purchase this cd after loving Bebel Giberto's "Tanto Tempo", as Suba was credited for one of my favorite songs.  However, for those  who revel in the true Brazilian sounds of samba and bossa nova, Suba's sound is not what you are accustomed to.  After listening to a few tracks I was bored with the repetitive techno sound.  While there are a few interesting sounds here, give me real musicians and sensuous rhythmns over electronic sound 
 I picked up a copy of this pretentious garbage at a library used book sale. I paid one american buck for it, which was about 100 cents too much.  It's obvious from the start that Rush is extremely impressed with his massive vocabulary. Probably giggled himself to sleep each night after he finished his writings, imagining all the ignorant folks who would need the same dictionary he used to write it, in order to decipher his blather. I would recommend any of John Steinbeck's novels to any human who plowed his or her way through this dire drivel, simply to clean their mental palate. Dumpster fodder. 
 I rented this movie because I really adore the two lead actors.  However, although they do the best they can, there is no saving this banal, movie of the week-esque movie.  There are a couple of nice moments, most notably when D'Onofrio's character talks about his father and about his love of football.  Other than that, the story seems to be cobbled together from many other "uplifting" movies.  At times, you can not only guess what will happen next, but can guess what the exact line will be.  Football hero becomes self-pitying after an accident leaves him blind (and unable to satisfy his cheap girlfriend in the sack--which she exposes in a tell-all book).  His tutor from school shows up, himself in a wheelchair, and pops this crazy idea to enter a whitewater rafting race.  Even though he professes to have it all together and is all rah-rah, he still feels his own sadness that his dreams of being a dentist were dashed by a drunk driver.  But first--you knew it!--they have to learn to trust each other.  This involves whacky stunts.  The two drive to the race, having adventures, learning about themselves and each other, suprising locals with can-do spirit.  Each scene seems to end with the two sharing a warm laugh in the fuzzy sunset.  Each person they run into is nutty.  And even though I said I liked this, the lines from the scene where Olee talks about his dad seem to practically be directly from "The Breakfast Club" where the jock talks emotionally about his dad.  Only the commitment of Hines and D'Onofrio keep this one from getting no stars at all.  So to recap: Person who's cocky and beloved for his physical prowess loses it and feels sorry for himself? Check. That person has one last chance to hear the chanting of the crowd and relive the glory? Check. Another person who's been down that same road of self-pity and redemption comes along to save him? Check. Two men bond on the road and endure colorful locals? Yup. Student becomes teacher? Yes. Locals try to keep them down? Check. Other dreamers lend a hand? Drunk driving? Boy stunted emotionally by father? Bathroom humor? Improbable competition set up to prove worth of the outsiders, and won to stirring music and cheers? All those who've been touched by the quest and who we've met along the way show up at the end? Suprise ending that is supposed to warm your heart and teach you what's really important?  Yes, yes, yes 
 If you are looking for love, romance, witty banter and everything else that has made Suzanne Brockmann a hit....don't expect it from this book!!  The romance is undeveloped, sparse and stale.  The suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt.  A great read if you're looking for nightmares.  
 Throwing usnuported by the facts claims about Serbs and intentionally distorting the truth - are the only marks of this book. Good for garbage bin, as somebody already mentioned here 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Although most of the advice is pretty standard that you get in any how-to-write book, my two stars comes from his statements that you must have a premise (such as "Cheaters never win") before you begin to write. This kind of approach is perilous for beginning writers, leading to work that can be preachy, predictable, and cliched. Many times, the true premise of a story or novel makes itself known during the revision process, but to begin your first draft that way is to try to shoehorn your story into an ill-fitting formula that serves neither the reader nor the writer 
 I can never forgive Mary Calhoun for her book _Audubon Cat_.  This book is a glorification of a cat while it hunts birds.  As a bird watcher I was highly offended, and as a father I found it very awkward trying to explain to my child what the owl was going to do to the cat it caught 
 Not very good for a house with impatient people. It was a little sticky at first, by the time I contacted seller, they broke it. 
 i love terry pratchett's work; i've read plenty of great discworld books, and even a few that i thought were just mediocre (by pratchett standards) but this book is crap. just a sorry pitiful excuse for bringing back rincewind from the nether regions. if you've never read terry pratchett, do NOT start with this. and if you're just dying to know how Rincewind got back into the discworld... well, save yourself the 5 bucks and dream up your own story, its bound to be better than this. i don't feel that pratchett put his best efforts into this, rather, i get the impression someone begged him to bring back rincewind, maybe shoved some money in his face until finally, the author said, "yeah, fine, i'll write it tonight while i'm on the toilet" i just wished he'd flushed 
 I have been on the phone, and on the internet with LINKSYS support suince I received this ite,  The install discs did not work.  The support personnel cannot help.  After an HOUR on the phone, stumped, you are CUT OFF and have to start over.  E-Mails to LINKSYS are ignored.  I am NOT computer illeterate, but you have to have a systems degree to install this unit.  Mine is still sitting here like a lump--I will return it to Amazon and ask for costs of shipping as THIS IS A USELESS PRODUCT.  
 This book is now five years old. It has no information on any Palm device likely to still be out there. A waste of money. 
 Instead of being titled "property and freedom," it should be titled "property and power." Pipes was a prominent old cold-war apologist for American capitalism, and you can tell that he is still trapped in his little world of false-dichotomy.   Pipes overall argument is contrived, and with the exception of his knowledge of Russian history, superficial. Most of his time is spent criticizing the Stalinist Soviet Union, while at the same time lacking any thoughtful rebuttal to Marx's critique of capitalism.  His title claim, that freedom cannot exist without private property, is weak philosophically and logically. He has poor insight into the nature of freedom and presonal responsibilty. He would really benefit by reading some Sartre or Nietzche, before trying to describe his own made up idea freedom. His attempts to link economic thought with philosophy and history fail miserably. He barely exposes the actual writings of Marx. This is incredibly unfortuante since most "real-world" capitalists, such as wealthy Wall street brokers, know that Marx understood capitalism better than any of its supporters. His philosophical support is all anecdotal with no real thoughtful analysis. His historical summary, although detailed with Russia, leaves much to be desired. He fails to discuss slavery, prostitution, or even slumlords, all which flourish under American capitalism.   Although some might find his credentials enough to accept his flimsy argument, I for one was greatly disappointed. I realize that property is linked to power, but freedom is something completely different.   I'm sure many right-wing folks will look past all of this flaws in this books and embrace it. I'm sure the paternalistic allure of an established Harvard professor will cause some to avoid challenging the views in his book.    But I'm not trying to convince those people. Look past the credentials, the excessive use of footnotes to appear more "academic" ( a clear sign of a writer who is insecure of his own beliefs!), and the comfort of someone who agrees with your agenda, and you will discover shallow puerile nonsense 
 I found this book to be thoroughly uninformitive. The author's "understanding" of his subject matter  was non-existant and he made many statements that were blatantly wrong and altogether idiotic.  If  I  could I would give this book negative five stars 
 Instead of being named "AC and the Age of Steel," it should have been named "The Age of Steel with Andrew Carnegie."  This documentary is more about steel than this famous rich guy.  They don't even bring up Carnegie until one-fifth of the way into the work.  They show about two photos of him and that's all.  You never learn if he went to college, what charities he supported, or how he died.  They show a photo of Carnegie with a man I believe to be Booker T. Washington.  Did Carnegie support Black colleges or other African-American causes of the time?  This work never answers:  all it does is focus on steel.  I can't believe that the History Channel actually thought a marketable number of people would want to know about that.  Leave that boring stuff in an engineering classroom!  I liked that the interviewees came from a diverse range of universities in the South and North.  I hate that I'm buying into ideas that only "great men" are worthy of historical works.  But still, yawn!  I was left very disappointed 
 I agree with all of the other reviews about this tent and its durability, however my daughter absolutely loves it.  First the three plastic sticks that come with the tent to hold it open broke and warped pretty quick.  I went to Home Depot and bought three wooden dowels for 79 cents each and cut them to the correct length and it works great.  My daughter uses this mostly inside and it is fine, when outside the wind and everything else did move it around.  I bought a 4 pack of plastic tent stakes from target for about $1 and put one in each corner to hold it in place, works great.  I think we paid $19 for this at Target and it definitely seems worth the amount of enjoyment my daughter gets.  If you are expecting a $200 high quality camping tent, you will probably be disappointed 
 These are $10 headphones. There's nothing amazing about them in my opinion.  I bought them to use with my ipod when I'm out, or at work.    Right out of the box, I was disappointed with the fit, and I know everyone is going to be different, but for me they just aren't comfortable.    The sound quality is clear, but very thin and lacking bass. Even when I'm pressing them into my ears to get the best possible fit, the bass just isn't good. EQ settings to boost the bass don't help either, and often reduce sound quality even more.   The ear clips don't really seem to do that much either.  They kind of keep them on your ears but don't really hold them IN your ears at all.  The ear pieces tend to get tangled together easily as well.  In summary, I wouldn't recommend these for music, but if you want a cheap pair of headphones for listening to audio books or some other kind of spoken word, they might be good-IF you can tolerate them in your ears for that long 
 When yours truly was eleven and in Reading class, "Incident" was required reading.  This had to be the most ridiculous book that I ever had the displeasure of reading. I mean, the boy is cared for by a badger!  Badgers are mean and ornery critters that don't much like people or even their own kind.  I did not believe it at eleven, nor do I now. Also, Eckert certainly didn't need to include some of those descriptions.  Was it really necessary to describe a mother badger eating her offspring's excrement?  What eleven-year-old wants to read about that? So, for kids who like to read long descriptive passages about things they really didn't want to know about in the first place: this book's for you 
 This movie is the most frightening film I've tried to watch with my [...] daughter. It is NOT suitable for very young children. I was rather horrified by just how creepy it is. The juxtaposition of the saccharine bears with the sadistic cruel scary "spirit" is truly bizarre and could;ve been created by someone who in fact HATES children. If you are not buying this movie due to your own nostalgic desire to relive the 80's, but to watch something sweet and cuddly with your sweet and cuddly children, be forewarned. This movie is not only bad, it's kinda 'bad'. Like, not in a good way. If children are not involved in the purchase- but you are reliving the 80's or getting some really weird gift for a friend, then, you know, maybe you'll dig it. I didn't 
 This book is for specialists, mapping Earth. Myself I found it not interesting 
 This is the story of Sheriff Bell, an insufferable dullard who won't shut up about how criminals these days are really evil (as opposed to all the lovely ones he knew of when growing up?).   He's also a world-class boaster, never going more than a few pages without telling us how fantastic is wife Loretta is. The same Loretta who spends most of her time baking for or writing to evil criminals -- which tells me all I need to know about that marriage.  The yakkity-yakking doesn't stop there. An even bigger gas-bag is Chigurh, the motor-mouthed murderer. In fact, he kills people twice. Before he shoots 'em, he bores 'em to death. His weapon of choice: Lectures about coins. (His final kill took so long, I had to restrain myself from flingling the book across the train carriage.)  On the technical front, McCarthy does not structure the drama in the Classical way. He chose the Boring way. The majority of scenes end exactly as you expect and only one character (Moss) has a believable goal. McCarthy also omits the obligatory final scene, between Chigurh and his prey Moss, which was the only reason I kept reading the book. No doubt this is to defy the expectations of the reader. Expectations that this might turn out to be a decent story, in my case.   What's more, Sheriff Bell has no scenes with either Chigurh or Moss, making him a narrator with zero personal stake in the action. Because McCarthy writes good, visual dialogue, he gets away with an inconsequntial narrator for the first half of the story. But when the man on the run (Moss) exits the story, there is no other character to invest in, so the plot grinds to a halt. McCarthy cannot resusitate it because there is no connection whatever between the two remaining main players.  So, does McCarthy put us out of our misery? No. Sheriff Bell waffles on for pages and pages about Vietnam, not unlike John Goodman's character Walter in the Big Lebowski. And that's it.  My verdict: I hope Loretta runs away with a criminal. Preferably one of them new evil ones 
 Something like 15 years ago, I ran across the first three annual volumes of this anthology at a science fiction and fantasy bookstore.  Ever since, I've eagerly looked forward to every volume, for weeks or months ahead of publication.  Once received, each yielded a couple of weeks of daily reading treat.  I admit, since I dislike horror, I've always wished that the horror had been spun off into a separate volume.  Still, Ellen Datlow's taste in horror is pretty sophisticated, some of it being closer to dark fantasy, which I do like.  I always read the horror last.  But Terri Windling's fantasy selection more than made up for the horror content of the volume.  All those stories culled from "literary" magazines I never read (as being too modern and New-Yorky) for my taste.  And her roundups/brief reviews of new fantasy books!  I've discovered so many "mainstream" books and authors not marketed as fantasy from Windling's reviews.  Since the inception of Amazon, every roundup had me rushing to put at least ten more books in my shopping cart.  Unfortunately, this is probably the last annual volume I'll ever buy.  The new team editing the fantasy content, Kelly Link and Gavin Grant, just are not up to Windling's standards.  First, in both the story selection and the roundups, it seems that they did not read nearly as wide a range of sources as Windling did. Second, their selections were lackluster.  The stories I really liked I'd already read in major fantasy magazines. The others were . . . sort of all right.  Mildly interesting.  But not worth that many pages.  I discovered one book worth buying in the review roundups, which were also lackluster.    All in all, the uninteresting fantasy combined with that much horror, meant that the two weeks' delight I'd experienced for so many years, turned into a month-long slog, with me frequently counting stories (I don't read them in order) to see if I was finally almost done with the thing yet.  Let's hope there's another change of editors soon.  And maybe, just maybe, they'll put the horror in a separate anthology, where it belongs 
 It's got some occasionally interesting puzzles, but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal Keepsake might have had.  The Good: Unique and challenging puzzles; handy hint system helps keep the game moving.  The Bad: Some of the worst voice acting you will ever hear; blurry, low-res backgrounds; dull characters and an uninteresting story 
 FIVE STARS for the movie ONE STAR for this DVD because it is MISSING THE KEY SCENE when Clara talks to her parents in their bedroom after Marty drops her off. The DVD cuts from Clara putting her key in the door to Marty walking to the bus stop. Why the scene is cut I haven't a clue 
 This is an extremely dry anime.  The manga version by Masamune Shirow is filled with bits of humor.  Not so for the anime.  The character Batou was especially funny in the manga, but, for reasons unknown, he is the driest character in the already humorless anime version. Expect long scenes filled with monotonous talking.  These really make the movie crawl.  One minute there's action, next you're listening to Matoko or Batou go on and on about existentialism.  Seriously, these little talks, take up 3/4 of the movie. The visuals are awesome, no question about that.  Even so, they do not fulfill the need for SOME kind of thread of a story.  Altogether, not much actually, HAPPENS during the movie. If you must see it, rent it first to be sure you want it 
 Dr. Andrew Fielding, a quantum physicist, is killed, although it's made to look like he died of natural causes. David Tennant, MD, assumes he's next. They are two of the six men in the inner circle of the scientific team funded by National Security Agency working on Project Trinity.  Trinity is a massive, secret (big surprise!) government-funded effort to build a supercomputer dedicated to artificial intelligence - a computer that thinks. David is on the team to keep the ethics in line, as he is a Professor of Ethics at the University of Virginia Medical School. He has been seeing a psychiatrist, Rachel Weiss, the past few months because of his narcolepsy, the side effect he encountered after undergoing his `superscan' into the Trinity computer. All six of the inner circle had been scanned and each had a different side effect. Thus, his crusade to find the cause of everyone's neurological symptoms.  David figures out who killed Dr. Fielding, so he and Rachel have to make a run for it. The story details their narrow escapes, David's realization of who is betraying him, and how he overcomes these difficulties. Who do you trust is really a big question. Trinity `goes live' and causes chaos and confusion around the world. David and Rachel play a big part in getting Trinity working for good, not evil.  This was a tad too sci-fi for my taste and too long, partly because of the detailed descriptions of David's hallucinations (where he sometimes sees himself as Jesus).  If you're a computer nut and like technical subjects, you'll like this book 
 Rather than resell this book, I recycled it.  This book is superficial and poorly written.  I wish I hadn't bought it.  I wonder if it were just slapped together and dumped on the market to make a quick buck.  
 This was the worst purchase of any type of computer hardware that I have ever made. It felt very light and flimsy, the definition of cheap plastic. Not just the construction but the performance was terrible. It would work perfectly for about a half hour and then go on a break and do NOTHING for about 10 minutes. This was very very frustrating. Maybe I was just unlucky and received a defective one, but I wouldn't take that chance again.  I wish I could give this device a worse rating, somewhere around -4 would be much more appropriate. 
 This is a wonderful period piece of a Victorian family in New York.  However, the transfer to DVD is a disaster.  It is almost impossible to hear or understand the dialog as it sounds like it was done with a scratched record.  It is so disturbing that my students stopped paying attention and asked me to shut it off, which I did.  I haven't watched it since.  It's too bad because it is a great film.  If you can find the VHS version you will be thrilled 
 My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.  Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.  Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.  TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
 I'm not surprised that someone with very little exposure to philosophical thought would find the arguments of this book convincing. The authors do a great job of employing misleading statistics and frequently resort to logical fallacies (petitio principii, mainly) in their arguments. This book is great if you want an anti-capitalist screed, but it fails miserably as an impartial analysis of business ethics. Like ssaber, I was disappointed to find a three page "defense" of capitalism and a ten page attack of it in Chapter 4, "The Nature of Capitalism." The authors include the views of a wide range of notable experts in this section, including but not limited to Karl Marx, George Soros, and Bertold Brecht (yeah, now there's a real authority on the subject). Why not include Sean Penn while you're at it, guys? I wasn't surprised to find that they'd skipped over real economists like Keynes, Hayek, and Friedman. 
 Try before you buy! This game has a major glitch: its save game files are erased sometimes, so you can start all over again. Beware 
 This novel was very frustrating for me because I just could not connect with the main character, Sam.  I found him attention starved and annoying.  Although the author did an excellent job at portraying the character of Sam, I have a hard time getting engaged in a novel if I can't connect to the characters.  Also, if you are looking for a happy, complete novel I would not recommend this one.  It will leave you lost and dissatisfied 
 I felt sorry for my daughter this past Summer. She picked this book out of a list of 5 to read for school. The writing was all over the place, the plot went nowhere. Really boring. zzzzzzzzzzzzzz...... 
 Sorry but i totaly disagree with all these positive reviews.I'm a fan of war classic films but this one is a mess.Nothing is moving,action is zero and filming is poor. we are very far away from dirty dozen,battle of the bulge,midway,enemy below etc.... a total waste of time and money 
 I heard all of these great things about this book etc...... So I got a copy and let me tell you it was a huge let down. I can honestly say it had loads of disgusting passages that I did not find at all entertaining. The "bowel movement" chapter was totally repulsive. I found it self indulgent, he had a crappy upbringing, that does not make for a good book 
 First off what is garbage?  Something you use for about two hours and then toss it in the trash can.  So is there a difference between garbage and trash. Yes..............trash lasts longer before you toss it in the can.  Good thing Common exposed this [....]  But hey, at least he has one good thing going for him by snatching up the sexy T-Boz from TLC but that is ALL hehas going for him. Put it like this .....A three year old could make a better album.  Stay Away...............Far Away 
 Jay Griffiths does some good work in places pointing out some less obvious results of and evidence for the quickening/ cheapening of our culture, but her text is fairly rambling (sometimes in a good way, but generally not, with points being made over and over with little further elucidation) and there's irrational male-bashing pretty frequently.  The book is mostly a catalog of the differences in concepts of time, ownership, history, etc. between western and non-western cultures, and it gets stretched thin in most places. My main objection, however, is her constant science-bashing.  After the first few chapters, you'd think that Newton was responsible for all of the suffering and exploitation in the world; she demonizes the process and results of science, calling atomic clocks and the like "silly" - but I'm sure that she wouldn't turn up her nose at a GPS receiver or computer!  It's obvious that she doesn't understand science at all, but instead takes an outsider's critique of concepts and processes that she has only the vaguest conception of. (OK, one example: she quotes the 'ridiculous' speed of computers as being some high number of "gigaflops per second."  7 gigaflops is 7 billion floating point operations per second [FLoating point OPerations per Second], so gigaflops per second is a ridiculous and nonsensical unit. 
 _Show_ was recorded and released without the band's consent, and was disowned by David Yow shortly after its release. The half-studio half-live _Lash_ EP was recorded and released the same year, and not only does it have the band's approval, it's a much better-recorded and better-sounding disc, the true logical follow-up to Liar, which was one of the best albums of the nineties. Support the band 
 Typical of recent multicultural efforts it is a book heavy on theory and unsupported assertions. Facts are only given when they support the multicultural agenda of the day. For example, in my reading of Chinese-American and European-American memoirs, I have found that relations are often shown as containing much more mutual respect than any multicultural historian will allow. This book also uses "whiteness" rhetoric--a substitute for substantive analysis. Every group is tribal to an extent--favoring their religious, ethnic or cultural group. Examples aboud in Asia, for example, but everytime any European-American favors themself it is "whiteness." China and Japan have over their long histories have practiced their own discimination, such as massacres or immigration restrictions on foreigners. We of course don't reduce all of Japan's history to a criticism of "Japaneseness." Euroamericans were worse, of course, but some of the actions called "whiteness" are just the same cultural self-preference everyone else is allowed 
 This book has a lot of useful information about puppy development and personality - but it recommends the choke-chain leash-correction training approach, which has been abandoned by many dog trainers. Setting up situations so the puppy gets it right and is then rewarded is much more humane than jerking the poor little one around 
 I have to say I was very disappointed with this book.  The author seemed to be reaching too often to come off as a wise academic and ended up surrounding a complex topic with stilted language and delivery that made the point be lost on the reader.  The writing style and tone is extremely pretentions and the recounting of the discussions with his students are dreadful.  I continued to find myself wondering if the author was being serious and needing to focus on what he was trying to say.  It was frustrating to continue to try to figure out what he was trying to say when he should have just been saying it.  Honestly, I don't think there is much new that this book is adding to any discourse on the nature of money.  There seems to be little original thought and just the recounting of fairy tales, poems, myths, bible passages, etc., to convey the thesis of the book.  It should have been much clearer and could have been much better.  The book also rambles and could have been 80 - 100 pages shorter.  In sum, don't waste your time.  You'll get little out of this book b/c there's not much to get 
 Had to stop about 1/4 of the way through it and give it away 
 This book isn't witty, funny, amusing or enlightening. It's sick and sad. Don't buy it. 
 Out of all of the first season MOH episodes this was the one (besides the unaired Takashi Miike episode) that I had the highest hopes for, but in traditional MOH fashion I was disappointed yet again.  You think somebody would at least accidentally make a good episode.  Angela Bettis giving a performance so stiff it's painful to watch - think the robot from "Small Wonder" with the voice of Ted Levine - is Ida, an entomologist, who receives a strange insect in the mail.  Unknowing to her the bug bites her hot girlfriend's ear and the ear swells up super fugly and squirts puss.  Ida never notices this mutation even after days of off screen (boo!!!) lovemaking.  What I just described took 40 minutes of screen time.  [Spoilers]  The last 20 minutes with its grand total body count of two (boo!!!) isn't much better, Ida discovers that her hot girlfriend has been taken over by the insect and has murdered the landlady.  The hot girlfriend then kills a friend of Ida's and distracts her while the bug sticks his icky thing in Ida's ear.  How exciting.    Here are just a few of my problems with this story: Why waste so much time with Ida and her hot girlfriend hooking up?  Why not just have them together from the beginning?  Why make such a huge deal out of them being lesbians?  Do entomologists really have bugs crawling out of their clothes at all times?  The body count is two.  Why waste time with the pointless revenge subplot?  Ida doesn't notice her hot girlfriend shooting pus out of her ear 
 Please, I beg you, purchase one of her other books!  I have read nearly all of Aiken's works and they are FANTASTIC.  However, this book was very cut-and-dried, dull, and prejudiced.  The characters of the island people were so caricatured that it was borderline offensive.  No child deserves to have to read this book 
 This book deserves no stars.   PLEASE stop buying and promoting this rotten book! This is a book about a rotten, selfish self-centered male who takes everything including the life of the female tree. Even at the end when he chops her down to sit on her as an old man, he's still unsatisifed and has a big scowl on his face!  The female tree gives and gives and gives, and the male (from boy to old man) just takes and takes and takes and is never satisified, happy or thankful.  What kind of story is that?  This is truly a rotten story. Don't buy it! Don't give this to your children! 
 I hope to choose 0 star if I could. I agree with one of the reviewer said the book loses it's focus. For example, the way it introduces Java RMI is very disappointed: it neither clearly described the idea very well nor the implementation. Therefore you end up learning nothing. You would say this is a academic textbook but in contrast, the Silberschatz's classic "Operating System concept" does the RMI introduction pretty well 
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 I read this book right after Norman Maclean's A River Runs Through It.  Let us look at the substance first. I applaud the author for many things. Among them, for not trying to stretch the amazingly thin plot over any more than 130 pages, which it takes comfortably. Second, for insinuating but not conferring the name of Sherlock Holmes on the old detective. To have flirted with accident but avoided a direct/dangerous hit has, I suspect, left the driver as well as the pedestrians healthy enough. I have hope that they will each continue on their journey with very little scarring and an unimpaired memory of their favorite detective.     As for style, for all those interested, I recommend both of Norman Maclean's books for a lesson on the exact meaning of brevity. True brevity  simply reduces the vehicle which carries the power of the story. Infact, the power becomes all the more starker for it. Poorly executed brevity cuts out power proportional to the removed verbage. Such is the case here. To all authors, taught and aiming brevity, I plead, in reducing the weight of the overcoat, do not lose the wool. Keep it warm and keep it alive.   The vocabulary is solid enough but feels like pepper sprinkled over a spoonful of cold, cold pasta. The words being, individually, pretty much the only admirable things, the novel is the highbrow pulling the lowbrow into its own world rather than walking over to the latter.  
  I tried. I really tried, but I was simply incapable of getting into this program. The lead character in Nighty Night is so thoroughly, contemptably self-centered and unlikable she makes Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm seem like a big cuddly teddy bear. This is a person who has not had an unselfish thought for another human being in her entire life. She's also insane. Completely. And not in a cute or funny way. She dosen't live in this world. She lives in one where the entire universe revolves around her, making it entirely acceptable for her to say or do anything no matter how ludicrous, dishonest or rude. She literaly has no idea she's a monster. I can see how that could be funny but not with this show's incredibly dry, lifeless presentation. I never thought I'd say this but Nighty Night could actually use a laugh track to let us know when the producers think we're supposed to laugh. And I hate laugh tracks. 
 What's with all the titles using the word Fantastic?  Wow, that's so original!  Did you write that yourself?  Anyway, I was disappointed with this one, like many others here.  I thought it was a big waste of time and talent.  I would have liked to have more of a plot-line set up, and some type of comarardarie between the Fantastic Four.    But this slack was garbage.    I would not rent or purchase this movie.  MC White said:  Not F.... darn it, I almost did the same thing 
 Our bookgroup scheduled a speakerphone chat with Donna Woolfolk Cross, author of the "other" Pope Joan, and I bought this book by accident! I was so confused when everyone said how much they loved the book -- only to find out I had read the wrong one. I had so much trouble participating in the conversation because I had so much trouble slogging through this Royidis/Durrell version of the story.  The Royidis/Durrell version of Pope Joan is sl-o-o-o-w moving, old-fashioned (after all, it's more than 100 years old), and dull. In contrast, the Cross version is fast-paced, riveting and impossible to put down!  The notes at the end of the Cross book, documenting her research, are fascinating, and make it so clear that Joan was more than a fantasy.     If you insist on reading this version, read it for comparison purposes only, and enjoy a good snooze. If you want a great read, accompanied by actual historical reference, purchase the Cross version of Pope Joan 
 This book was a big disappointment to me. Its premise has so little substance that it does not even rise to the level where it can be tested with truth.   Lindsey heads a pro-globalization think tank, as well as being employed by the Cato Institute and Reason magazine.  These organizations all espouse extreme libertarianism.  What that really amounts to is not far from Vonnegut's notion of the money river - some are close to it and some are far away.  So Globalization lets the money river get bigger and it thrashes about, changing its course, giving young opportunists like Lindsey a chance to get closer to it as it continues to ruin the environment.  His theory is simply a veiled version of the latest far right form of red baiting.  Anyone who suggests the government needs to rein in big business is a communist.  Only someone as young as Linsey, too young to remember the red scares of the fifties, could say such things with any seriousness at all.  You'll have to go elsewhere to get any useful information about globalization 
 Here we go again....another tortured collection of three chord, twelve barre Delta Blues. In truth, these songs were redundant and whiny when the very limited Robert Johnson first recorded them; now hearing Clapton ressurect them is just plain annoying. How many times can we hear "I woke up this morning, baby; My cow just up and died.....da dum, da dum, da dum.....I woke up this morning, baby. My cow just up and died. Da dum, da dum, da dum.... So I drank a bottle of hooch and I began to cry....da dum, da dum, da dum...." Come on, people! If this is genius songwriting and guitar playing then we should all simply throw in the towel on civilization. When Eric Clapton plays Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, and Rogers and Hart on his guitar---unaccompanied----chords, melody and bass line----like Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass----then maybe I'll consider him a great guitarist. Today's youth are clueless about almost everything, and guitar virtuosity is no exception. I don't believe Clapton has ever heard of key modulation, arpeggios, or chord substitutions. In truth, he is an average rock guitarist, and considering the primative structure of rock and roll guitar playing, that's not saying much. For anyone to call him a great guitarist, let alone the greatest guitarist whoever lived, is indicative of either juvenile delinquency or just plain stupidity. It's like saying Madonna is the greatest singer of all time. Odds are those who make such vacuous, ludicrous statements are the children or grandchildren of the druggie Woodstock generation who wouldn't know a great guitarist if he/she tripped over him (which would be likely since they were all drugged out of their minds most of the time). I know we're living in the age of grand mediocrity, but enough is enough. Go buy a Wes Montgomery, Django Reinhardt or Barney Kessel album and listen to sophisticated, nuanced, and soulful guitar viruosity. If you have half a brain, you'll throw away your collection of rock guitar icons and beg foregiveness for being such an uneducated, unsophisticated nitwit who once claimed that one-dimensional druggies like Clapton and Hendrix were great guitarists. If after listening to these truly talented guitarists who actually play more than three chords you still hold to your position that Clapton is a great guitarist, here's what you do: pick up your Fender Strat, turn the amp volume up to 10, smoke a joint, and go stick your head between your distortion chambers and fuzz boxes and make a lot of noise and pretend you too are a great guitarist. Eric Clapton is a great guitarist! What a dumb society we have wrought since the late 1960s. 
 Now that Professor Chasteen's personal friends, ex-students, and professional connections have had their say, perhaps a dash of insight would be relevant. This is a lousy book, in part because the premise is ludicrous. There cannot be a concise history of Latin America for the same reason that there cannot be a concise rendering of Newton's Principia. Thus, what professor Chasteen has provided is a concise overview of his personal prejudices, the vast majority of which he directs against (and here's a surprise) the United States and Europe. That these prejudices are personal is evident from the dedication (in which he states that his Latin American children are improving the US simply by their presence) until the meandering, pointless fizzling out of his discussion 250 pages later. The history is mediocre, at best, and some of Chasteen's opinions are so ridiculous (anyone historian who singles out the Carter administration's foreign policies for admiration has been hitting the bong a little too hard) that you have to wonder why he continues to live in a country he so plainly abhors.  The writing is so saturated with neoliberal condescension that professor Chasteen's acknowledgement to the over 100 students who read the manuscript seems a wholly fitting exercise, given that they may well have written the dreadful thing 
 This film was dreadful.  Streisand is absolutely unlikeable.  To enjoy this film, you would need to buy into the romance between Streisand and Nolte and I just can't see how that is possible.  I couldn't believe it when I found out how critically acclaimed this film was.  Along with The English Patient, this is one of the worst 'critically acclaimed' films I have ever had the displeasure of viewing 
 I got this book last Friday.  I'd read The Birth of the Firebringer years ago and had been looking for the second and third book in the trilogy ever since.  I have to say I was greatly disappointed in this second part of the trilogy.  Aljan is dragged out to sea and winds up in the land of the two-foots without memory of who he is, knowing only that he must find the secret of fire.  A good concept, but poorly pulled off.  Pierce loses the sense of magic and adventure that was such a big part of the first novel.  It's also much darker than the first and third.  You don't really feel like it fits at all with the other books.  The only places it ties in are the beginning and end.  It feels more like an interruption than a continuation of the original story line 
 I would underline what several reviewers pointed out about pictures and make (that's what the 2 stars are for), but I found that there are several serious errors in this book. One can find photos taken in Saudi-Arabia (pp222-223) or Israel(pp276-277) in the section about AFRICA! Hey, this is National Geographic--so far most reputable source of everything about our planet. The Middle-East and the Arabian peninsula are part of ASIA and not of Africa. I was astonished and very disappointed to see that the editors apparently didn't take care about these 'minor' issues 
 I was bored - really bored, which is why I picked this book to read from the free book trade shelves at work.  It has a good basic story but is so formulaic that I was able to predict the ending after the second or third chapter.  Being a medical professional, it was difficult to read about procedures that are outdated now and remember when they were cutting edge.  Perhaps it's also a bit scary to remember those I've worked with in the past who have had the same narcissistic outlooks.    I think I'll pass up the other books by Dr. Cook that I have not read as of  yet.  This is the second one of his that, in my opinion, bombed miserably 
 This book is a nightmare; thoroughly confusing. Authors do not know how to teach! Brigham & Company will take 30 pages to explain a concept that can be done in 2 pages. I used this book for my finance class for my MBA; this one is not worth the money or your time. 
 This futon is nothing more than cheaply welded garbage. The welds holding the metal mesh together on the bottom of the frame have begun to break after little more than two months of use. The matress is also very thin and after two months of use has become very uncomfortable as the frame can easily be felt through it.  I wouldn't take another if it was given free to me, so don't blow any money on this garbage 
 I believe that these authors received a big kickback from large factory farms and big business 
 I am glad to know it wasn't just me. I was really disappointed by this book. I have tried to read everyone of Cornwell's books and picked this one up based on past experience. It does not even come close to her usual skills. It may be that it was written for serialization in a magazine. It should not have been allowed out as a book. Her publishers did not do her a favor by letting this go out to the public. It is possible that Win and Sykes could become interesting characters in a well developed book; they were interesting in this book and I liked the setting in Cambridge, but it wasn't enough 
 This story is about a Vietnamese Child who came to America.She needs money for her mother to come to America, so she and her class makes a fair so she can come.But Ut waits a long time and she never camed to see her.Then finaly it is the last day of school.And she sees her father and Little Quang.And beside them...her mother 
 There are some writers whose books are so, well, just plain bad, awful, terrible, dreadful, etc., etc., that they're a waste of perfectly good paper.    This is so bad--  It deserves to be blamed for global warming.    
 I love and admire sandy weill.i purchased this book to learn more about the man and his deal making prowess.although this book was well research,its presentation was what turned me off.i have never read a book so disjointed and dull.it doesnt follow the conventional chronological sequence that most biographies does but skips back and forth from one event to another i.e 60's-to-the-80's-to-the-70's-to 60's again...this goes on and on and on.this can be very very very frustrating.Also i dont think the authors did a good job in capturing the readers since the paragraphs come and go in that fasion throughout the entire book!  All who follow sandy weill's career knows his excellent ex-protege, jamie dimon.I would loved to learn more on Mr Dimon (curently President and COO of J.P Morgan Chase & Co) and i hope there will be a book on him in the future.  All in all, sandy weill is one hell of a guy who has done tremendous things in the financial sector.but if you really want to read a book which is more entertaining (or way better) than this book,then you should read "Tearing Down the Walls:How Sandy Weill fought his way to the top of the financial world...and then nearly lost it all" by Monica Langley.The book by monica langley is way way better and enjoyable.You'll also learn more about Jamie Dimon!!  In conclusion,dont buy this book but the one by Monica Langley.... 
 I thought this book could have been much better. The chapters on dating and jobs are helpful. However, I just can't seem to get past the chapters on body image...To me it felt like the author was trying to say, "your gonna get fatter as you get older so you can better accept it now. You'll be even more fatter if you have children, so the sooner you accept this the better"  Excuse me, but this is supposed to make me feel better about my body? Maybe it would come across better if she said something along the lines of "You may find your metabolism slowing down, but thats nothing a little exercise and eating right can't fix". I am almost willing to put money on the fact that the author is overweight cause this comes through very much in her writing.  That alone just made the book a rotten deal for me.  Some parts of the book rang true for me, like examples of how your mind changes as you age. But i really don't think there is much advice worth paying for.  
 Unless the definition of scratch and stink has changed since my youth, the stickers in this activity/coloring book smell like any other page- dusty- no matter how much I scratch 
 What a shame that gems such as Longfellow Serenade, Signs, Lady-Oh and Both Sides Now were left off this release in exchange for several low quality live recordings that DO appear.   Given Mr. Diamond's long and illustrious career, this release disappoints. Again, what a shame. So much potential and so little fulfillment 
 This band has had some interesting moments over the years, particularly their seminal release, "Up In It", which featured alt.punk classics like, "retarded."  THey made an MTV worthy breakthrough with "Gentleman" but after that their legacy just sort of trailed off... This album yearns to be a come back album, along the lines of "Gentleman" but it comes up short in every way.   The main plus to this album is the funky, groovy drum beats and guitar hooks, but they sound dry and uninspired compared to earlier whigs efforts. Also, the lyrics are grating and monotonous.... you'd think he'd find something else to sing about after all these years, right!? If you are a die hard fan, then of course you'll want this album for your colleciton, but if you're new to the whigs, start with Gentleman 
 While it doesn't indicate it, this is a heavily abridged version of the story, and pretty much just deals with the elements contained in the 2002 film.  It's still a good story, but gets 2 stars for not indicating that it's abridged, and because even at 1400 pages, the full unedited story by Dumas is MUCH richer and makes for a much more satisfying story.  Do not cheat yourself of that satisfaction by settling for 1/3 of the story 
 Just read the previous review (about 'simplifying' the language in Jungle Book). I am reading the ORIGINAL text JB to my eight year old son (for over a week now), and he's not once indicated that the language puzzles him.  He did ask me why Mowgli uses thee and thou and wouldst while talking with the animals, but  accepted my explanation without demur.  Reminds me of the lines from an Elinor Wylie poem "Our mutable tongue is like the sea  Curled wave and shattering thunder-fit;  Dangle in strings of sand shall he  Who smooths the ripples out of it." Say it out loud, and feel what it does to your mouth and face - that's what Kipling's prose does 
 I'm sorry to say, this work will not rate very highly on my scale.   The author is brilliant, not to mention right on the things he says. It's just that the writer's style is so abstract and nebulous that he's absolutely maddening to try and follow. One moment, he'll be talking about how religion evolved, and the next he jumps to an illustration that takes half a page and uses language that is so illusive you ask, "What in the world is he saying now?" I got so excited in the first chapter while things made sense, and then noticed how he drifted here and there, making good points and then totally abandoning them.   I bought this book three years ago and just recently finished reading it because I had to keep going out of my way to put it down and come back to it!! It never seemed to get better. I gleaned a few good points and enjoyed it...well...sort of, but the author is so unclear at times that it drives you nuts - and this is coming from an atheist who agrees with the philosophical position of the author!  Overall, I really cannot recommend it unless you are a VERY slow, contemplative reader who doesn't mind an unorthodox read. Other than that, the book is packed with some good info. I just wish I could have gotten to it more easily.  (JH)  www.ministerturnsatheist.or 
 Heard this band has had some success in Europe,so I assume they're trying for an American fan base.Their sound is somewhat complex.They combine funk,metal,punk and hip-hop.Didn't really do all THAT much for me.A couple of tracks I thought were 'okay' were "Mental","Respected" and the heavy-duty "Spiritual Warfare".If you're into the likes Fishbone,Bad Brains and Living Colour,you'll most likely get more out of this CD than I did 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 I have never written a comment about a book, but hopefully other people will at least be warned.  This is the one of the worst books I've ever read.  I have read several Wiley books; most of them are poorly written and lacking substance.  This one is unbelievably bad.   This book deserves a negative five stars.  (Who wrote those other reviews?) If you have never read a book on trading systems, then this book is may tell you something. Otherwise, save your money.  There's nothing here 
 This is a completely ridiculous and unrealistic movie.  Josie, at 25, is still not over the fact that she was unpopular in high school, and whines for the entire movie.  It's unclear why any one likes her, espesially her teacher.  It's also hard to get over the fact that the teacher, beleiving that she is in high school, makes no attempt to hide his feelings.  The final scenes tie nothing together and the issue of her betrail is not delt with.  Never Been Kissed isn't good as a silly unbeleivable comedy; it's both painful to watch and devoid of any redeaming qualities in its content 
 I liked the idea of this, the concept, so much more than the book itself. The life story of a famous villain sounds intriguing, but this falls short in Maguire's hands. He is good with language and turns of phrase; almost Byzantine at times, his writing is appropriately other-worldy, but it becomes distracting and too obvious for the most part.  He is not good at telling an absorbing story, even given some wonderful stuff that is already established. This book is slow going, and not at all similiar in whimsy or wildness to its original material by L. Frank Baum.   This could have been such a fun and fascinating story, but it is not. It is about prejudice and politics, and it paints an Oz that I wouldn't want to visit. Baum's Oz was colorful and dangerous and strange.  Maguire has taken a children's classic and made a very adult prequel/parallel novel, and he twists the Baum work and the 1939 film to fit into his vision. It reminded me at times of fan fiction.  The Witch I know could not have been a sympathetic and misunderstood person; she wasn't a crusader for animal rights. I like my villains bad, not in some gray area.   And now the sequels will keep churning out. Son of a Witch, The Cowardly Wars, and so on. I can just imagine future titles like The Quadling Child, The Fall of the Monkey Kingdom, blah blah blah...     I'll pass 
 This was my first (and probably last) experience with a book by Saul Bellow.  I found this book to be extremely difficult to read. I got through about a quarter of it before finally giving up and donating the book to the library. This book might be a classic, but quite honestly I found it boring 
 That Robert Coles' heart is in the right place and that his experience working with children is extensive, no one can dispute.  But his writing is characterized by wordiness - even chattiness - and it undermines the serious nature of his topic. Perhaps the loose writing style is an attempt to make the book appeal to "every parent," - and not just educators - but instead it renders the whole work laborious and permeated with a condescending, patronizing tone. In the current political culture, a book on the moral life of children written by an educator of Coles' calibre would be expected to nail a spot on the N.Y. Times bestseller list for weeks, if not years.  The fact that less than two years after publication I picked up a hard cover copy at a book clearance for 75% off is a testimony to lazy editorship more than anything else. What a huge loss for our society 
 This is kind of a boring and dry book.  It mostly talked about the Desilu Studios and how it evolved over the years.  I was hoping for more about Desi and Lucy as a couple and their ups and downs in their relationship, but I guess that's in Lucy's Book "Love, Lucy" (which I plan to read next).  I would recommend this book for Lucy fans as part of their collection, but if you're like me and want the real "scoop" about people and their lives, steer clear or be prepared to be skimming over some pages. 
 It's not easy to criticize this book, because it is beautifully written and captures something tragic and poignant and important:  the emotional trials and conflicts of a spunky twelve year old girl who is coming of age in a world that doesn't understand her.  But McCullers' darker undercurrents taint the book.  Threaded throughout are elements of sexual perversity, terrible sexual boundaries with children, and hints at pedophilia, leading me to question strongly what in the world happened to Carson McCullers when she was a little girl.  Furthermore, the perversity often pops up in a disjointed way that adds nothing to the book's power, and thus reads largely as gratuitous.  A few examples from the book - a book which I did not finish because I didn't trust where its author was taking me:  1) The main character, a pubescent twelve year old girl who is nearly five-foot six, has spent her whole life up till now sleeping in the bed with her widowed and single father, until he looks at her one day and realizes she's "a great big long-legged twelve year old" - McCullers leaves exactly what he means to our imagination - and kicks her out of bed.  2) The girl's best friend is a six year old boy, whom she bullies and torments, and then basically forces to spend the night with her in her bed.  McCullers makes a point of showing how they change their clothes for bed in the same room - "with their backs turned to each other" - and then get in bed together.  Once the little boy is asleep the girl, who is two months away from turning thirteen, rubs his bare stomach with her hand, licks him behind his ear, and then nuzzles up to him.  (Also, imagine if their genders were reversed!)  3) The father takes a married couple as boarders in the house, but the girl - then age nine - walks in on them doing something overtly sexual with the door left purposefully open.  McCullers leaves it to the readers' imagination what her little protagonist viewed.  4) McCullers talks about the girl character, age twelve, having had sex with a neighborhood boy.  Again, she gets vague on details, but why is she sharing even this much?  If you were to remove the literary style and add a scant few more details, you would have child pornography.  5) Eventually the girl changes her name, wears an adult dress that makes her look much older - and goes out on the town and meets a visiting adult soldier.  He comes onto her sexually - though stops only because others come into the bar where he is giving her alcohol.  One is only left to wonder where the book will go from here.  Because this book was written in the 1940s the author can get away with it - and perhaps also because she's a female author - but really, it's disturbing and perverse 
 This tablecloth bleeds. As soon as it got wet we all ended up with red checked arms! I ordered a dozen from oriental trader for the same price and they are perfect! Go figure!   Avoid these 
 This book is exactly that. I know Mr. Morehouse and one of the people he writes about in this book... my father, Mel Riley. All I can say is, you should read Paul Smith's accounts if you want the truth pertaining to the Stargate and RV stories. There is also a documentary, if you can find it, made be Discovery BBC called "The Real X-files" featuring a true and honest view of RV and it's history with the military and all those involved. Giving this book much more than 1 star is really admitting lack of intelligence.  
 At last we have some honesty from Democrats. They hate anyone that disagrees with them, which conversely is why they have such a love affair with socialism and communism. If you enjoy freedom and liberty you will despise this wretched book which is just more hate filled Democrat drivel 
 This book is written in the guise of a journal Anne Boleyn completes while awaiting her execution.   To anyone who's read a Jean Plaidy novel in which Henry VIII figures, it should come as no surprise that she continued her crude portrayal of the legendary king in this book.  Henry is portrayed as a fat, beady-eyed, petulant, lustful, vulgar and spoiled child.  (Some of this must have basis in history, since other writers have used the lustful and fat approach.)  He is given no depth, no redeeming qualities; he is clearly The Villain Of The Piece.  It's a disappointment, but not a major one if you've already read other works about the mighty monarch.  Your memory will be able to fill in a more well-rounded Henry.  (See especially Margaret George's "The Autobiography of Henry VIII, with Notes by His Fool, Will Somers.")  But Plaidy's treatment of Anne Boleyn is what surprised and shocked me.  Henry's second wife has generally been accepted throughout history as an adulterous woman who may or may not have been "a witch" but who certainly behaved more wickedly than a Queen would be expected to...a woman who was more desirous of the approving glances of men than of pleasing her husband or attending to affairs of state.  A woman who stopped at nothing to get her own way and assumed she could sweet-talk her way out of punishment.  But Plaidy paints her as a total innocent, a sweet girl who is completely unaware of the King's regard.  Apparently for the years when Henry is pursuing Anne, she is simply mooning about Hever Castle in the company of her stepmother, keeping house, or else being a maid of honor to then-Queen Katharine of Aragon - oblivious to the "mad pursuit" of her by Henry.  Even after they are married, Plaidy's Anne is a happy, cheerful woman who wants only to bear Henry a son.  The notorious scandal which preceded Anne's beheading (a scandal which affirmed that Anne slept with several gentlemen of the court, including her own brother) is glossed over, garnering only a quick mention at the end - with of course Anne's bewilderment at the news that she's to be beheaded for this.    I can't tell if Plaidy genuinely believes that Anne was innocent of any scandal, or if she's being gently, subtly mocking of the reader (and therefore of Henry VIII).  The pages of the "journal" mention Anne's astonishment at such a scandal but Anne, writing, never actually denies that the adultery happened.  She merely muses, as a detached observer, at the strangeness of the scandal.   However, none of Plaidy's books to date have shown much subtlety, so I assume Anne is meant to be portrayed as a total innocent whose end was manufactured for Henry's marital benefit.  If you don't already know the history behind Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, this book may not make much sense to you.  Since Henry is a minor character, we are given none of the historical happenings beyond a few major things (the meeting at the Field of Cloth of Gold, for example) told through Anne's eyes.  If you want to know more about Anne, I recommend Ms. George's book mentioned above.   
 The music is great and the group is excellent, but the product could be better, it last only 56 minutes, now technology allows 80 minutes room for more music, the record company should stop issuing this version and create a new one adding more songs from dog eat Dog, as the Bitter Pill or its acustic version as B-side, So far, so good, Let it rain, original I saw red, may be adding some new songs to make more attractive..well, anyway, here is the best of Warrant and is the best on one Cd to crack it up to 10! For 80's nostalgia excelent 
 As I read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by Mr. Cussler, the story was slow and the plot was transparent.     This book just didn't have the "zing" of the older Cussler stories.  If you are just laying around with nothing else to do it will give you something to read 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 There certainly are many ways in which maternity care in the USA could be improved.  But this author's recommendations are not among them.  Even an open-minded person is put off by a great deal of plain old misinformation in this book.  For example, an epidural does not (as claimed in the book) involve sticking a needle in the spinal cord - YOUCH!  Nor do women who have epidurals have more back pain afterwards than women who do not have epidurals.  Because it's the pregnancy stupid!  The book winds up being a colossal straw man.  Maybe someone else will write a truthful book incorporating factual information, rational analyses and sensible suggestions for improvement 
 These retail now for $229 at BRU. Just ridiculous. I own one, bought it on eBay for $28 since it was a local pickup only sale. I got a heckuva deal, I'll admit!  This is a fantastic carseat.....but folks, it's JUST an infant carseat! I went looking on eBay for one, since, having had babies before, I couldn't fathom shelling out even $100 for a cheapo, often-recalled Graco, let alone $229 for a Peg Perego!  All new babies sweat in car seats....they can't maintain their own body temp until 4 months of age, which is when they grow out of these seats (unless your back goes first) :).  I understand the precautions about car seats being in car accidents.....another folly of the infant gear industry. If car seats are in accidents, they're junk folks.....they aren't in re-saleable condition. And when was the last time that you heard of a car accident involving a baby? Because how many new parents of newborns who would buy a $229 carseat (read: first child) go out further than a trip to the store?  It's a regular old car seat. They can't do much to these, really, except change the fabric. They pretty much prey on your fear surrounding your new pride and joy, so they gauge you on your emotions....hey, I'm a sucker too!  Infant seats are notoriously small, so that you have to buy up the next size faster. They get your money on the car seat and then the stroller, before you are out of that hazy new parent fog and wise up. Save your money.....your baby or your back muscles will grow out of this in 4 months, no matter what.....and then it's $229 right down the drain, faster than a speeding bullet.....Guess you can save it for baby #2.  Think of it this way...for the SAME amount of money, buy a Britax Roundabout and have it last for 4 years versus 4 months, or go on eBay and buy one of these, 4 months old and pretty much brand new, for less than half the new price 
 Let me just start by saying this gun is terrible. The images are misleading; the gun looks to be of a shiny more durable plastic, but it is a dull black. And it smells really badly at first. Not once did the gun shoot over 100 fps, and is sold at 300. My friends didn't even notice being shot. I have a 300 fps pistol, it leaves welts through jeans. This ISNT 300 fps. It's a rifle fit for an infant who's been dropped on their head and thinks it's good. never even shot farther than 80+ feet. bad buy 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 Product is hard to review because you sent me the wrong battery.  As of 1/29/07 it has not been taken off my credit card.  How would you rate my review 
 I believe in a lot of the topics in the book and Julie Soskin did a nice job introducing every topic there is. It is nicely layed out, but VERY brief and corny. For example, one of the eight questions for Rating your pet's ESP is Does your dog howl or hide during a seance or other psychic happening? I was excited to go through this book, but ended up extremely disappointed. The worst part is I lost the receipt and can't take it back 
 this cd is not worth the 14 dollars it costs. It was a complete waste of energy and money. no matter how hard u try, you just can't dance to any of mariah's songs. This dyke troll is getting really weak and her beats are starting to get old and boring. she'll never fit into anything at dressbarn, for those of u who dont know, that's a plus size store. that nasty oreo is a straight hooch and she cant sing, she just screams and whispers like a man. she cant find a note and her face can stop a clock. lose weight! all the ppl who gave her good reviews are just trynna support her cause they're oprah lovin trash who think mariah represents compton even though shes a troll. done 
 The heat from the original machine warped the plastic replacement pitcher during the first use.  The pitcher is now unusable 
 This book is merely a hundred something pages long and yet 99% of what the two authors said are in defense of the traditional church doctrine. The only credit they gave Dan Brown is the fact that he stirs up the debates reguarding Mary Magdelene. That's it. The rest are just praises of how the church's version of the history makes better sense, has more morality and is more ethically-oriented. They completely dismissed any Gnostic ideas. You don't need to waste a few dollars on this book when you can attend the church for free and have the pastor tell you the same things 
 don't get me wrong, i love david byrne too.  but david bowman may  have been better off just f***ing him and getting it over with.  this book is pretty well written, if poorly edited, but is so laughably skewed to make david byrne appear to be an infallable and ethereal genius and to make the other members of the band look like absolute monsters.  the author obviously hates tina weymouth and can't include a single quote from her without interpreting it to mean that she's untalented, stupid, bitter, spiteful, and jealous.  he can't include a single quote from david byrne without explaining that if he comes off as a little rough, it's just because he's misunderstood (and a genius, and handsome, and creative).  i enjoyed reading this book but didn't take any of it seriously.  david byrne is clearly the creative force behind the talking heads, but bowman is basically a talking heads denier-- he doesn't even believe anyone else was in the band besides byrne 
 I found this to be excruciatingly boring. The material is at best obsolete and of little value. A waste of time and money and not appropriate to one searching for a history of Jesus 
 Do not buy.  This may be the worst product I've ever bought.  It has never worked properly.  I've kept fresh batteries in it, but it's still no good.  Within 10 feet of the laptop, I'll click three or four times and nothing happens.  Then, I'll click and the slides go in fast forward until the end.  It's quite embarrassing to be giving a professional presentation and have this happen.  Awful product.  Believe the bad reviews.  It's worse than they describe.  The only positive thing I can say about the product is that it doubles nicely as a cat toy.  My cat loves the laser pointer 
 seriously, if you've read the joy luck club you've read them all. in case nobody noticed, her books are all the same. whoever said that the kitchen god's wife was a duller version of the joy luck club wasn't that far from the truth because it just WAS the joy luck club, only you've read it already so you knew what was coming. ie fights between mother and daughter. how profound/prosaic. really, read one of amy tan's books and you can talk about all of them with some kind of authority. 
 It is unfortunate this book didn't come out better. Some glaring problems with it include: - has no concept of energy physics to begin with - does not understand "hydrogen economy" (hydrogen's an expensive storage, not a source of energy) - downplays geological data of oil discovery (or doesn't understand it), although Hubbert is covered briefly - believes or disseminates half-baked unproven ideas from the research sector: scientifically not valid energy sources are brought forward as alternative fuels - does not deal with the net energy concept (EROEI) or even refer to it  With these fundamental oversights it's really difficult to recommend the book.  It's not completely without merit as it does tell some of the basics right, but mostly it's pathologically impartial journalistic fluff, without looking at the hard facts as a good researcher should.   It's too much about how we are miraculously going to replace oil, gas and coal with tar sands, nuclear power, hydrogen and live happily ever after.  To those readers who want to believe this, this might be a good book. People looking for valid and scientifically solid reasoning on the subject will be sorely disappointed.  I'd recommend books by Deffeyes, Simmons, Heinberg, Campbell and many others before this (all on peak oil) 
 This is by far the worst business book I have read in recent years.  It is hard to believe that Andy Grove actually thought that this material was worth putting into a book.  As other reviews have said, this book at most should have been a short article in Business Week...but even then it would require some actual content to make it worth reading.  The best part of the book is the quotes on the cover from Steve Jobs et al.  It makes me wonder if they even read the book 
 I was (wrongly) advised by tech support to buy this instead of waiting for a new supply of power supplies from Voodoo.  Be sure your computer is supported, because Targus tech won't give you any info about voltage , amperage or wattage on this thing, so you can't safely maake it work with an unsupported computer.   So Amazon, As usual, graciously took it back.  Love Amazon.  I just now read the other reviews and now consider myself lucky I didn't keep it and try to make it work 
 I bought 3 of these and I threw them all away.  Your coffee will stay hotter in a thermos than on this warmer.  I think a light bulb would do a better job!  I wrote to Mr Coffee several times and never even had the courtesy of a reply 
 I did not find this book very useful.  I suppose I was looking for more of a book on Access and the application of relational databases.  I should have picked up "Grover Park George ON ACCESS" and avoided this one.  However, even if I only had only wanted to learn the basics of relational databases, I should not have bought this book.  It has about 25% of the substance that I would expect from a book of its length.  The author explains every little thing over and over, and explains why he's explaining things, then provides more examples than necessary.  To me, this book was an unfortunate waste of time 
 The cover of this book promises that it will show you how to apply trend following to your porfolio. "Covel walks you through the process, one step at a time, in plain English." This is misleading. Aside from a back test on some basic systems, there is no concrete discussion on how to trade trends in the entire book. The portraits of the major trend followers are not uninteresting, but Jack Schwager's Market Wizard series is far superior. Covel also goes to great lengths to "prove" that trend followers were on the winning side of all the major crises and meltdowns of the last decade (e.g. LTCM), but the only proof he offers is that a number of trend followers had gains in the months where others were losing. Much of the book is packed with statistical data on performance that might be of interest to someone writing a thesis on the subject. If that's who you are, buy the book, but don't expect much nuts and bolts information on making money in the market.  
 Once again, the next (and hopefully the last) volume to Millar's Ultimate rework on the Avengers has been released on shelves, and what is my reaction?  The same as before, except this time my jaw drops at the realization that the story has gone beyond lunacy.  What threw me off may have been the appearance of Nazi aliens.  Yes, that's right, NAZI ALIENS.  One has a massive grudge against Captain America, and why I am still quite unclear.  Nor did I care. The last one I at least had a glimmer of care for one or two characters in the Ultimates team: Captain America and Bruce Banner.  Unfortunately, Captain America has now become the least interesting, except in his early fight against Hank Pym (for some strange reason I found myself confused about whether Hank was winning or Captain America).  As for bruce Banner, Millar fails to give him further dimension, and instead pushes him to the side just as before, except when Captain America taunts his Hulk side to eat the Nazi alien leader.  What a jerk, that Cap.  In the end do we get a clear realization that Bruce just ate a guy?  oh yes, a few panels, but who cares about bruce?   In the end I honestly didn't care about anything that happened.  If anything I was impatiently waiting to get to the end, skipping the parts that I didn't care about.  The illustrations were grand, excellent work by Bryan Hitch.  It is unfortunate to say that I can't say the same to Millar.  Thank God Millar didn't touch Spidey 
 I hated this book.  I thought it would be funny, and I wanted to read something that wasn't the typical.... but the author's take on everything is so negative that I couldn't stand to read it.  She indicates you're doomed to get fat, your doomed to be uncomfortable, you're doomed to have an idiot spouse/partner, etc.  People like this author give pregnancy a bad name.  Yes, it has its moments of being uncomfortable, icky, etc., and if you choose to focus on all that, like this author does, you'll also be miserable.  I chose not to be 
 Coupland's JPod is no exception to that rule. Although never blatantly publicized as a `sequel', it is hypothetically purported to be Coupland's new millennia answer to his early 1990s geek epic, Microserfs.    My comparison, Microserfs vs. JPod, in short? Microserfs, in my opinion, was Coupland's zenith of writing aptitude -- fresh and original with `real' characters that many a geek could relate to. The microserfs made you want to care about what happened to them. The story actually went somewhere.   JPod? Stale as 3-week-old bread, artificial as Twin Equal `sugar' packets, featuring two-dimensional unbelievable characters. Gone are the refreshingly all-too-human disillusioned "microserfs" with their witty repertoires and flat foods. They are replaced with JPod'ers -- dusky, gutter-mouthed and aimless, with their couldn't-care-less-about-anything attitudes. The result? We could care less about them. Coupled with an implausible, over-the-top, and insipid plot, it is a novel that evokes apathy and indfference. Coupland's frequent referrals (blatant plugs) to his other works of fiction were uncomfortable and tawdry.   Not that there weren't any redeeming qualities in the book. The reader is treated to a few remaining bits of Microserfs-esque laurels -- the memoir-like narrative, the fun cubicle surveys ("if you were to sell yourself as an item on eBay...") and splash pages with binary, spam, and technical what-not. However, it was not enough to compensate for JPod's weak plot and characters, which ultimately made the novel uninteresting and difficult to finish. As much as I wanted to like it, I didn't. At all.   It was mentioned by a friend and fellow Microserf-aficionado that it's "harder for authors to write like disenchanted young people when they have been rich and famous for 20 years."    I agree 101% and couldn't put it better myself.  
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 The author of this book describes it as "Lots of fun" but forgot to continue the phrase and include "for the demented" because personally for me this book was no fun at all. I mean compared to some of her other books this book is really bad. I liked Catherine Coulter and i like most of her books but this one...well i regret having wasted money on this one. so boring i didnt even finish it! The main trouble with this book is the dialogue..long and silly. the characters are realy not likeable at all -jack and Grey. Grey's reaction to JAck's stealing his horse was way too exagerated and hard to believe. I would have liked to finish this book but, frankly after threee attempts i gave up because its so boring and childish. Yes childish and if you read if for yourself you will surely agreee. The author clearly tries to be humourous...but, in my opinion does not succeed in doing so. A book is not made humourous just by putting stupid dialogue and a silly storyline. I made a mistake because i chose to ignore the other reviews which were posted here and bought it anyway : 
 In his introduction, the author attempts vainly to put Merrill in the same category as Morgan and other great financiers. The problem is that he was not a financier, just a guy riding the trend of retailing in the 1920s. But his gratitude for his own personal pension fund appreciating in the 1990s and attributing it to people like Merrill is extremely embarrassing. This suggests that the author is trying to ingratiate himself to Merrill's company. A little balatant. More to the point, Mr. Perkins did not seem to understand his topic very well. He constantly refers to the backroom at Merrill as "backstage." The backroom and its problems was a big topic on Wall St from the 1950s through the 70s although Perkins seems unaware of the whole problem and constantly refers to it as backstage. Did anyone ever research a topic so poorly? Whether Merrill deserves a full fledged biography still remains unclear after reading this amateurish attempt 
 If you want to learn project management or get better at it, don't read this book.  It brushes over important concepts and spends and inordinate amount of words attempting to describe the profession. It assumes detailed knowledge, gives very poor examples and, in summary, is a total waste of time 
 Unless you want to spend all your life make this think work dont buy this non-sens dvd. First you need an internet connection, second you should be in US or Canada (or use proxy servers) third you need too rollback your WM Player 11 to 9 or to 10 (for 10 version you need a patch to make it work); then your IE browser vs7 aparently not work so you need to go back to version 6! and soon an soon. You should be a computer gig, if not forget about it. Every 10 days you should go though all procedure again to renew your licence, accept EULA, if not you dont watch!  I regret I spent my money and more important my time on this 
 Uhhh, puh-lease. Okay, maybe a little kid who was like, 3 would like it, but older kids will find themselves snoring away. I had to read this book for school. It is about two unintelligent little kids who get a dog. They lose the dog. They are sad. They can't figure out who took the dog. The dog comes back. Whoop-dee-doo. End. Ya see? I could have written this book better. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK!! EVER!! 
 This book is as worthless for research as "The Da Vinci Code." I was particularly shocked at the authors' decision to ignore the fact that Tycho was an unbearable snob, a petty despot and a complete boor in order to portray Kepler in the worst possible light. If Tycho was indeed poisoned, it may have been by one of the hoodlums in his family or one of the many powerful nobles he snubbed. Although it is common to sacrifice the innocent in the interest of sensationalism, this pseudo-historical account, with its extensive bibliography, truly sinks to new lows in selective revelation. The cynical allusion to Kepler's religious ambivalence is the product of the post-modern approach to religion, where, for instance, Catholics get divorced and hope for the best. It is clear from his writings that Kepler took his religious commitments seriously and was genuinely hurt by what he called the un-Christian attitudes between the brothers in Christ.  The decision to overlook this along with other well documented information that calls Tycho's character into question (for instance the horrors of his treatment of the Hveen population or his routine snubbing of Christian IV) and reveals Kepler as a man of conscience falls somewhere between irresponsible and slanderous. 
 Cheap quality production!!! This was a Holiday gift for my wife.  When she opened the package, both trays had large chips of enamel missing along the metal edges. It looked like neither tray had been inspected before being put inside the box. Then the "fun" began as I tried to get a replacement for the damaged items from Amazon.  I checked the box on Amazon's on-line site asking to have the set replaced, as I was requested to do, and waited for the E-mail to be sent that was promised in the instructions.  Five days later: nothing, not a word from the company by E-mail.  So, I went to a near-by store that ships things, paid to have the bake set packed up, and then paid for shipping.  Next, I went on-line and did a search on Google to find Amazon's 800 number.  As you will discover, you cannot find it on the Amazon site; at least I couldn't.  I called, sat on the phone for 15 minutes, and finally got through.  After discussing the problem with the representative of Amazon, I got reimbursed for the cost of the packing and postage to send the set back to the company.  And another set was sent.  It arrived five days later. There were no problems with these trays. Bottom line:  Too much time wasted to get the item replaced by Amazon.  Amazon: please, please put your 800 number on your site where people can find it easily.  Also, if someone checks a box asking for a replacement, please get back to the person by E-mail as you promised!!!!!!!!!       
 A very disappointing book, and again, makes me very wary of any item on a "New York Times Best Seller List" or any other list, and really any big name reviewer recommendation.  This book has one 50 page chapter which is excellent - the recap of the Thompson "Shot heard around the world" homerun. If you are a baseball fan as I am, that (barely) made the book worthwhile. The other 700 pages are disjoint, incomprehensible, and really trivial. You come away thinking "I really don't care bout this stuff" - I don't care about the dynamics of trash, about J Edgar Hoover's bathroom habits, Klara Sax's artistic depression and annoying infatuations about roof tops, about characters that just don't have much depth to really care about. At the end, even potentially interesting characters like Albert (the one on the baseball quest) become hard to bear. The whole book in fact had the feel of going to a senior citizen home.  I read this book, as perhaps others did, expecting a book about the mafia or about other figures in the underworld. What I got was a book with a good first chapter, some interesting tidbits here and there about how life used to be in the 50's (fear of nuclear weapons, duck and cover classroom exercies), and a lot of knowledge about the trash business.   The "masterful" epilogue, as other reviewers call it, really does no justice to a reader who has spent so much time toiling over Delillo's ragtag story telling. I am ok with stream of consciousness writing, or nonchronological chapters, or even random chapters, but the methods used in thsi book served no purpose other than to further make the reading difficult.   Was this book about how mundane our lives are versus the bigger things that occur around us? Or how each of us is on an individual quest? Or that the 50's-60's-70's-80's were just years of fear, and the 90's are years of greed? I am still unsure, I still don't think any of these themes came across well.  Please - not pretending to be a sophisticate, intellectual, or professional critic - but this book is really not worth the time or effort. You can be staisfied by a number of other books, including the "The Corrections" by Franzen or "The Cold Six Thousand" by Ellroy  which cover a similar period or similar themes and do not make you so frustrated or disappointed at the end.  Read the first chapter, then put the book down or you will be sorely disappointed and have wasted an awful lot of time.  
 Anyone who objects to describing this mess as elevator muzak has no defense - the sad fact is that Gaucho is playing in elevators and restrooms around the world at this very moment!  Where to begin? The backup singing is absolutely atrocious, the piano tinkling so lame you find yourself swallowing hard to keep from vomiting, and the list goes on and on. Mark Knopfler was apparently in the studio for one song but the only evidence of it is the song credits. To top it off, this CD finally concludes the series of new liner notes by Becker and Fagen written for the re-mastered discs. Following the trend from the previous CDs, these notes are pretentious, uninformative, and too cute by several orders of magnitude.  Thanks to Aja and Gaucho, few in the late 80's or 90's bothered to wonder where Steely Dan had disappeared to - the concensus was that if this was all they had to offer then thanks for the first five albums and so long - it's been good to know ya 
 Goldman takes one of baseball's most entertaining characters and somehow manages to present us a story as lifeless as a pine tar rag.  There is no organizing theme to this narrative.  Although the  chapters are presented chronologically (playing career, managing in Brooklyn, then Boston), the anectodes skip around in an unorganized way -- making it hard to keep track of what is happening when, or why we should care.  Here's what's interesting: - Casey Stengel played for John McGraw, and they had a close relationship that amounted to McGraw willingly tutoring and nuturing Stengel's active mind.  McGraw was an important mentor to Stengel, as a faculty advisor is an important mentor to a graduate student.  (McGraw's influence among 20th century managers has been well documented by Bill James). - Casey was instrumental in shaping Billy Martin's playing career, both with the Oaks in the PCL and with the Yankees. But there are important differences between Stengel and Martin's approach to managing (although this is never discussed). - Casey managed some incrediblly bad teams (Boston Braves, NY Mets) and some incrediblly good ones.  And he liked to platoon players, use his bench, and valued multi-positional players that increased his decision-making flexibility.  On his best teams was able to rely on a few switch-hitters or star hitters that allowed him to save his platoon match-ups for players with reserve or part-time roles.  However, this rarely (if ever) was extended to pitchers, whom he constantly moved in and out of different roles regardless of their talent level.  What we don't read about in this book is how managers that came after Stengel also employed these kinds of techniques.  Whitey Herzog (for example) valued multi-positional players.  Earl Weaver built active benches with situational hitters around a few switch-hitting or star regulars (as did Herzog) and used complez defensive and offensive platoons.  There is a good anecdote or two in the text, but this is not the best source for reader's looking for funny Stengel stories.  At worst, this book merely reinforces the idea that baseball players are little more than Strat-o-matic cards to be shuffled in and out of the line up to manipulate probability distributions.  Upon finishing the book, we are left with little idea of how Casey actually liked to built his teams, communicate with players, solve problems or provide leadership.  We are told Stengel was (and considered himself) a good teacher, but we don't really know what Stengel was trying to teach, which is disappointing 
 I've read The Other Boleyn Girl and a great deal of Philippa Gregory's other works and found them to be thoroughly enjoyable and hard to put down.  It is therefore unfathomable to me that she could have written such a disgusting, morally-repulsive "novel" (and I use the term loosely)such as this.    This book is about a woman's desperate need to retain control of the land she grew up on.  Land which, by legal rights, passed to her dimwitted, sexually depraved, mouse of a brother.  The incest scenes are rife and horrifyingly detailed.  I could not bring myself to even finish this book, and I certainly was not about to read the final two in the trilogy.  If you have even the smallest thread of moral fiber...run the other way.  This book will make you ill 
 Eric Hobsbawm, dedicated to applying the none too convincing idea of "scientific" Marxism in its traditional petrie dish of history, wields the critic's pen more like a butcher's cleaver than the rapier with which he believes, a la Don Quixote, he is thrusting. So it falls upon this reviewer to stand in faithfully as Hobsbawm's Sancho Panza. As such I appeal to you, Eric, not to begin a work of historical analysis with an invocation to an intergalactic historian, for it is the most preposterous thing I have ever encountered. Perhaps you were intrigued with the Greeks' romantic, albeit "unscientific," appeal to the muse for inspiration? How else can we, your faithful followers in the pursuit of truth, justice and the human way in the study of history, explain this unhistorical incantation? Have courage, though! We know that your unwavering adherence to the "scientific" precepts of Marxism will excuse everything. In short, Eric, we know that you have been writing too much while watching Star Trek 
 Searching For Caleb had a new setting every five pages, family members who walked out and wouldn't have come back until they were "kidnapped", and chaotic events that led to a suicide, all of which made this book interesting in an unusual way. This book is first set on a train going to New York City in the year of 1972. Then the scene changes to Cairo Mill, Maryland. Suddenly it changes to Baltimore, Maryland in the 1800's. A bit later it changes to Baltimore in 1980. Anne Tyler told most of the story in Maryland, but at the end, she changes to Louisiana. The story was about the Peck family, which was a very sophisticated family. Wealthy, respectable, self-involved, they always wore hats.  Even the little girls never went out of the house without a hat on. Basically the story was about Daniel Peck's search for his brother, Caleb, who walked off in 1912. It was also about his granddaughter Justine Peck's realization that she will never be the Peck that she always dreamed to be. The concept of this book, then, is finding oneself. Daniel Peck's main conflict was evident in his search for Caleb. When Caleb was in his twenties he just walked out on the family and didn't return or make contact with any family member. The search started when Daniel moved in with Duncan and Justine Peck. Daniel spent years researching and visiting people who might have known Caleb. He would visit people that were Caleb's friends or appeared in pictures with Caleb. Unfortunately, he had absolutely no luck. So when Daniel's birthday came, his oldest son "Two" hired him a private investigator to search for Caleb. The private investigator headed straight to work asking questions. He found out that when Caleb was younger all one would have to do to find Caleb was "Hold still a minute and listen." He found out how Caleb loved music. He also went searching to Caleb's home in Baltimore.  Then the private investigator learned where Caleb was just outside of New Orleans, Louisiana. The private investigator told the Pecks this but before Daniel could meet Caleb, Daniel died of a heart attack. This book was draining yet funny; mostly draining. The hardest part was keeping track of what part the story was in, whether the past or the present.  Also the Peck family was absolutely insane. Actually two cousins ended up married to each other. That caused so much chaos that a separation, a disowning and a suicide happened over the event. Then Justine and Duncan were constantly moving because Duncan would become restless and wanted a change. Justine just went along very easily but Meg, their daughter, hated moving. She locked herself in the bathroom a few times.  Daniel did not begin looking for his brother for practically 30 years after Caleb walked out. The comical parts were the best. For instance, all the time that Daniel was searching for Caleb his old maid knew right where Caleb was. When Caleb left, he had told her where he was going. Yet she never told anyone because no one ever asked her. In addition, Duncan would cut out newspaper clippings and stick them to things.  To the old Ford that the door was torn off he stuck a clipping that said "Wouldn't you rather have a Buick?". When Meg bought an expensive dress, his cut out was "Have you ever had a bad time in Levi's?" One of Justine's neighbor was divorced and the father of her child who had no visiting rights would come and take the daughter. The mother would scream and shout about her daughter being kidnapped, yet every night the father brought the child home safe and sound. This book was very interesting, but a strange kind of interesting.  It never really caught my attention; rather it often put me to sleep.  It was summer reading, the kind you get on a book list.  I would suggest it to people if they didn't really have anything else to read. But some will like it. I found it too scattered in place and time and too slow moving. 
 I was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much, I thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything. But when I tried it I discovered 2 things. First off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place (which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one). And when I finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it's on it only burns about a calorie a minute.   This bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance (though I only tried it for a few minutes) but definitely not for your legs 
 It's almost as if this magazine writes it's stories 2 mounths in advance onces you get the "latest" copy it's news that has been repeated 7961,583 times . It does however have decent posters (that's why it got a 2 and not just 1) but thats about the only thing that this magazine has to offer.  
 I was very disappointed with this product...be Warned this is not the movies it is only the special features of them 
 It's been a month and I still have not recieved my book. I need book for a class and I am completely behind because this book has yet to arrive at my front door. And I have had no feedback as to where this book might be, but the funds where taken 3 weeks back 
 There was such promise, a woman who had "escaped" her ho-hum marriage, gone back to her roots was finding herself, starting her art work back up, caring for her mysteriously crazy mother, and then she "had" to fall for a monk, and turned this story into a romance novel.  When she "married" herself with knots into the sea, and lovingly talked about mermaids, it had some hope of independence, then it failed, going back to her husband after the "affair" (she got dumped for God.)  She didn't go back stronger, she went back wimpier and needy.  Sure, she had art in a gallery, but whee....where was her growth??  There wasn't any.  Sorry.  This novel leaves the reader disappointed and sad.  Ugh! 
 beautiful color, but very small in size, i guess i should have checked he pearl size first instead of just looking at the pictur 
 My 10 year old son got this for his birthday.  The screws are so deep inside the ball, we finally got so frustrated we just ripped off the foam covering the battery holder to be able to see where to place the screwdriver to get the screws out.  (The ball won't bounce anyway!)  Even then, the screws would not come out!  The lightup goal is great, but the ball is ridiculous.  Use your old nerf balls and then it's okay 
 I've enjoyed Wendy Wasserstein's work, so I expected more from her. I THOUGHT I'd find some real humor.  This little book is boring.  A 300-word article would have been more than enough. It's not funny, not interesting, not entertaining, nor does it offer any real point.  These "books" will probably be the sort of thing you give as a joke birthday/retirement gift, or "collect"  yourself, just to have a "set," thinking they might be "worth something" or "meaningful" someday.  I kept hoping for the book to go from a dwaddle to a trot, but it was the same yawn.  A cursory read, 10 minutes tops, is about all you'll need-- it continues as it begins, so no need to read more than a few pages. I doubt I'd follow-up with the other 6 sins if they lack the depth and wit of this one.  
 No No No!!! DVD technology is for quality image and  movie  collectors. This time Artisan did not pay respect. I think it's the worst DVD in my collection. Bad transfer, full frame and etc 
 It took two people to write this book? I was pleased to see a chick lit book for the 40-something reader but this book really was a waste of my time. You can see the ending a mile away, for one, but that didn't really bother me. It was the writing. The main character suffers from a syndrome that's unfortunately common to chick-lit heroines, which is to speak in an overly quippy, aren't-I-clever with my snappy dialog way. Nearly every one of her sentences included a quip/joke (or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke). Real people just don't talk that way, and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her. By the way, my copy had the first chapter of these authors' next book attached at the end, and they've basically created the same two main characters: the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend. I won't bother with it 
 More predictable than an old TV Land episode of Bonanza and much less entertaining, this story of an anti-government rancher and his three sons, one the upstanding sort who seeks to work for good within the system, one an idealist, and the middle son, Tristan, played by Brad Pitt, a tormented man who seeks to find peace within nature's anger. At least that's what I think he was doing. The fact is I never was a fan of this movie, not back in the 1990's when my best friend loved it (and predicted Julia Ormond would be a superstar--sorry, Gina, if you ever read this, I just couldn't resist working that in there, ha-ha) and not upon the occasion of a recent second viewing. I don't think there's anything to really recommend this movie to anyone. It's not spectacular in its setting, it's not revolutionary in its by-the-numbers story, and I found then and still find now that it is highly melodramatic and boring. To each his own, I know some love this movie, but from where I sit, this film is a would-be epic that never rises above fluff 
 I bought this book because I was under the impression that Ms. Langemeier would work with ordinary people like myself - and change their lives.  She took subjects that already had a base - 401ks and properties and showed them how to use them to build wealth.  I have none of these and was disappointed that there was no spring board for me to use 
 We went to see this at the time when we went to see any horror flick, much less anyting with Jamie Lee Curtis. It came out just about the time when every holiday was getting a horror movie named after it. Whether the movies promised to be good or bad, we went and had fun with them either way. This one we had fun in how bad it was. This was one of those, "picked on, pencil necked geek gets pushed over the edge by a cruel prank, only to come back with genius killer skills, somehow attained super strength and the speed of the Road Runner to get from one end of a train to the other to pull of impossilbie kills aided only by clever camera play." In short, there's nothing to be believed in this stinker. LIke a "Friday the 13th" flick, you merely wait for the kills, and try to outguess the next guy as to how it ends, and pray for that to come as soon as possible. The movie pulls out the stops, giving us Curtis for eye candy and David Copperfield to amaze us, perhaps even toy with us as to him as a possible suspect. But in general, this movie insults the viewers intelligence and lures you with a hope for a "Halloween" type thriller. There's too much stupidity from the victims, oh, until one genius finally puts 2 and 2 together. There's too much "not acting on a possible emergency situation in unison." And given her presence, there's just not enough Jamie Lee to make this crock worth sitting through. We had a gas picking this movie apart in the theatre. It made us callous for the impending onslaught of slasher flicks to follow in the 80s that got worse, more predictable, and far too numerous to maintain our interest. This movie got that ball rolling. Don't waste your time. You'll get more excitement out of watching Jamie Lee's finger nails dry for a couple hours 
 The installation of this printer went very well.  However, after installing the printer my computer began running EXTREMELY slow.  I checked and it was using 100% of the CPU.  I stopped all the processes associated with this printer and my speed returned to normal.  I contacted HP and they said it is a known problem and they are working on it (that was six months ago).  They still are working on it.  HP's solution is to install the print driver only (so you cannot use the scan or fax feature) until they write new software for this printer.  They should have recalled the printer since it doesn't work properly.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRINTER!!! 
 The leather on these gloves is soft and supple. and they're warm  thats about all that I can say that is good. There were scuffs when I got them. the stitching was ripping (and finished itself off soon after) and the fingers were different lengths on each glove. avoid at all costs. 
 The writer tries to generalize from the experience of four great statesmen in war times to make a conclusion that politicians should tell generals what to do!   I think this book is political biased.   Say if I was to reverse the equation and generalize from the experience of four great generals to make a conclusion that generals should tell statesmen what to do! Would the writer agree with me?   I could also write a few essays where democratic leaders just left his military leaders to do their job and the military leaders did a very good job eg  prime minister Eshkol  of Israel in the six day war and the Indian Prime Minister Mrs. Indian Gandhi in December 1971 in the Indian Pakistan war. Is the conclusion now that statesmen should stay out of the actual war.   Also I should stress is that most people are not *great*. To try to generalize from a few great men is a very dangerous experience. Great men by their nature are gifted and unusual. 
 Although the arrival/condition of the book was perfect, the content was very limited.  I learned nothing new and feel I wasted my money.  My parrot is still obnoxious.  I had so hoped I would learn techniques to change his behavior 
 Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less 
 I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)   Until now.   I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.   The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read. 
 Based on a true story?  If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy.  Did anyone witness this woman being raped?  People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men.  I made two previous attempts to try to explain my point but as I started reading the other reviews I found one that explains everything I was trying to say.  One review stated the following:  I gave this 5 stars because men who rape women deserve an awful death.  Why?  When is it justifiable for a man to take revenge by killing a woman?  This movie was a fantasy and I feel sorry for a person who thinks it represent reality.  To state that anyone should have the right to take the law into his or her own hands is a crime.  To defend your self is one thing but to intentionally want to kill is simply murder.  The fictional female character (not the actor) in that story should be sent to prison for life for her alone deciding to be the Judge, Jury and Executioner.  I also despise movies where the man does the same thing.  But, it is only a movie.  I gave this movie 1 star because you have to give it one.  Yet, that one review makes my point about the majority of these kind of movies.  Movies should stick more to reality when they are doing a film about something that could happen.  If this movie really is based on a true story than it is sick. 
 I dont want this album to appear on every search I do on amazon. If I search for rzewski or sorabji or glenn gould for example, I have no idea what this album has to do with this. And definitively you cant listen to classic as you can listen to pop music, its is a sin to take all this pieces from the different composers take some sections out and then put it on a album. This is a insult for the composer and interpret of this works 
 Does anyone know when the next 'breakthrough' diet book will be released? I just feel so lost without a new 'diet' to try....you know, like one that uses fancy sounding terms to make things sound official and important and even though I have no idea whether it's true of not even after I've read it, it just sounds to complex to be false....or maybe one that will reaffirm many of my current bad eating habits so I don't feel guilty....and hey, if I can loose weight on it....that's a bonus. I haven't found any diet book yet that fits any of the described categories above, but hey, I'm looking.  Thanks for you interest 
 The plot was very good, but I could not tell who was talking and who was being talked to during most of the book.  As an avid reader, I was looking forward to reading an easy-to-read, entertaining book before getting back to something heavier.  Boy was I wrong - I am not accustomed to so much dialogue confusion.  The book was poorly written and I do not recommend it to anyone. 
 I expected this book to be much more in-depth and interesteing.  However, Goodridge (a hack for hire  - freelance writing for boi rags like The Advocate) does not have the chops for this.  He offers zero insight.  Instead, he simply gives us slight and twee interviews of Directors.  It's a lost opportunity. Skip this one 
 I saw on the internet a picture of chingy rapping on stage and a notorious porn transvestite with HIS hand on chingy's crotch. Now I knew chingy couldn't rap his way out of a wet paper bag but I never questioned his manhood. Now that I saw the picture and read the article about Chingy and his transvestite lover I am so done with him. I hope the reviews he gets encourages him to find another occupation. This album is classic garbage and would be a perfect coaster for the next party you have at your house 
 When I received the punching nun and removed her from the package, her halibut fell off, the glue holding her black cape on didn't hold either.   I wouldn't buy another product through this company if this is the type of merchandise they are shipping.  Save your money and go to your local mall novelty store and pick one up.    
 For children just learning their alphabets, this video is too advanced. It doesn't even have the "alphbet song".   It has rhyming and "spelling" that is currently being taught to my first and second grader (i.e. words like: "near" "sky" ""stop" "friends")  The story line is too distracting.  Teaching lessons are too far apart to be beneficial.  Disappointing a multibillion dollar company couldn't spend a little on a consultant familiar with teaching preschoolers.  These videos, "Pooh's 123" and "Pooh's ABC" has convinced me not to trust Disney on education videos.  This is not a video for a preschooler, and only a review for older children already know how to spell 
 I have never liked the character of Nefret.  I wish it had never been introduced to the Peabody series.  I hope the future books are better than this one 
 I had the same problem with the CD's getting jammed... I had already changed it at BestBuy for a new one and it happened again....good luck with your unit 
 I've heard a lot about MS. Ray's show on the Food Network, so I thought this book might be an interesting addition to my library. I was wrong. Unfortunately I didn't scan the book before buying it, or else it would still be on the shelf. Most of my gripes have been covered now that I have read them. Un organized, no index, and to be honest, uninspiring recepies. 30 minute meals? I don't think so given the time it takes to find what's needed to create a meal, most of them seem to be the kind that were passed down by word of mouth, and not researched. Is MS. Ray a chef? I don't think so, and am not sure what her credentials actually are. So I can't recommend it, unless your a die hard fan of her and want all her merchandise.  
 I don't know if everyone's standards have changed so much because of text messaging "shorthand" or what, but I found this book to be nearly unreadable.    There are spelling and grammatical errors on what seems like every miserable page.  Apparently synonyms (like "steel" and "steal") are a concept Mr. Bourne never mastered - that and the compound sentence. The text is stilting, truncated and abrupt - absolutely no "flow" in the writing style.  I feel like grading this book like my high school english teacher used to do and sending it back to him; maybe he could learn something.  Do me a favor, Mr. Bourne, and use a spell checker.  Lastly, this reads more like an outline for a book than a book itself.  It doesn't even read like a journal or diary.  There is no character development, no dramatic tension, no identification with the characters.  It's more like reading a police blotter or a duty officer's log.  This book is horrendous.  Give it a miss 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 When I first got this home, it seemed to do the trick ok. The mice really avoided it, however we could still hear them across the room. I was going to order a couple more to place around the room, but they walk right past it now! It doesn't seem to affect them at all! For $20 it's not a bad deal because obviously it works for some people, it just didn't work for us: 
 Many reviewers and critics said it best...what do you do when the "hero" of the film (Ethan Hawke) is a complete a---hole, Winona Ryder is a horrid documentarian that would give Ed Wood, Jr. a run for his money, and Stiller, who is supposed to be the bad guy, actually isn't that bad of a human being?  And Winona's friends are the smarmy, arrogant, Generation X punks who think they know everything (when the reality is (forgive the pun) they don't know jack).  Past generations would quote Tolstoy and Shakespeare, Generation X quotes TV commercials, Scooby Doo cartoons, Star Wars, and bad sitcoms.  Generation X is probably the most insincere generation ever, detaching themselves and calling themselves "ironic", when all they really do is indulge in pretentious pseudo-intellectualism.   Is this film an accurate portrayal of them?  Yes, in some ways.  Is the film worth watching?  Yeah, at least once.  Stiller gives a decent performance, it's nicely shot, and Garofalo actually almost gives her slacker character depth.  This is probably due to the fact that Garofalo actually has some substance herself, as opposed to the character she plays. Check it out more as an artifact of its time more than a cool film.    
 This is not at all what might be expected.  The book is filled with pictures, the same 10 or so interview questions and a list of workout routines that vary, slightly, with each athlete.  There is no rationale included in the benefits or strategy of each boxer's workout or routine.  There is very little here that would be of use or interest to anyone interested in learning 
 HI I bought this seat thinking it would be great with the arm extension. I was so wrong! If your tub isnt made just right then it will not work and the seat itself is not secure. There are no suction cups to hold the seat in place either. I ended up breaking the arm lever off just so the seat would set level in the tub. But I have since purchased the aquababy seat ring and love it. It has the suction cups on the bottom and a release lever also toys on the front so baby can play. So if you are searching for a bath seat I dont recommend the safety 1st at all 
 The book is trite, boring and difficult to read. Poorly worded exercise questions make the book unbearable. The ideas are difficult to understand. Perhaps, a good editor could have saved the book. Or, any editor for that matter.  
 I bought this book along with The Great Book of Optical Illusions by the same author.  The "Great Book" was suggested by Amazon as pair for "More," and indeed if you look on Amazon's page for "More Optical Illusions" you find that many people bought both books.  However, "More" is just the last half of the "Great Book" so if you buy the "Great Book" you don't get any more with "More." This is especially galling in view of the text by author Al Seckel, who writes in BOTH books: "Many books on optical illusions reprint the same examples over and over again, but this is not the case [in this book]."  Amazon's book pages and suggested pairings may be generated by a computer, but this is one case where Amazon should insert a human's touch to make sure its customers understand before purchasing "More" that it is simply a partial version of "Great. 
 On the front page The Times is quoted to have written: "Extremely funny!". I didn't have one laugh. Not even a smile. I think that says it all. Let me add that the writing is not bad, but the main theme of the book is almost stupid, sometimes disgusting and certainly boring. And the story contrived and exaggerated. The background story of the Ukrainian family having suffered through the Stalin's regime and WWII concentration camps is more interesting, but is too sporadic to improve the overall impression 
 Some of the Reacher novels--such as The Killing Floor--have been incredibly good, but I was genuinely disappointed in this one.  The author describes Reacher as heroic, a loner, etc., but instead he should write in such a way that we reach these insights without being told.  Phrases, such as "back in the day," get repeated much too often.  Reacher has become a caricature of himself 
 I'm a baseball fanatic, and have read other books like this, esp. Bill James Historical Abstract.  This book doesn't come close.  Kalb's ratings are generally pretty good but the writing is sort of mediocre and his reliance on the clown princes of baseball Broadcasting (McCarver and Buck) just completely destroys any pretense of integrity.  As Lewis says in MOneyball, most of what the average fan learns about baseball is bull-----, and most of it is from broadcasters.  I do not know anyone who listens to Mc and Buck who doesn't marvel at their stupidity, so using them to bolster an argument about who's best is pretty feeble.  OK reading for a trip or airplane trip but not especially well done 
 It seems to be a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on the success of the Da Vinci Code. And just in case you missed it, there are several references too! The plot is wafer thin....who on earth would expend money and effort to simply chase a 4000-year old dream? All situations seemed to be too easily contrived and coincidental. Traps built several thousand years ago continue to work with the efficiency of a Swiss watch. Reilly thinks he's writing to a bunch of school kids.....exclamations, sound effects and hyphenated actions abound! Too obviously, the protagonists (Lily and West) have genius-level IQs and crack codes like you and I would crack our knuckles. The heroes have unfettered access to almost everything. Save yourself money and time .... stay away from this book 
 This book includes a number of random multiple choice questions.  In fact, that is all it includes.  There is no feedback as to why 'answer A' is the correct choice.  The information is outdated and uses obsolete wording. Took the test, passed with flying colors but it wasn't because of this book! Learned more from one of the CLEP recommended websites than the questions included in the text.  If Amazon had a Zero Star rating, this book would get it from me 
 The Interplak WJ7B that was mailed to me is not the same as the one in the picture at the time I purchased it.  The attachments are not the ones shown in the picture and the water tank is blue instead of clear 
 Mr. Goodman and his coauthor have taken the ills of the gambling industry and provided a snapshot-like, journalistic and moralistic view of the problems.  The authors never address the other side of the story about this industry; the job and business formation, the enjoyment the majority of the gaming public gets from gambling, and the considerable revenues that state and local governments receive from taxation and the distribution of employee's income.    There are no researchers who rigorously study gambling and risk-taking who support the unbalanced approach that Mr. Goodman has taken in the book. To further clarify the situation, Mr. Goodman has never tried to published a study or paper in this area that would be reviewed by experts in the field.    In short, the book is good journalism but unbalanced and shoddy research.  This is great stuff for further inflaming the passion of the anti-gambling public and for sound bites, but it is not to be used for policy preparation/analysis or for a general understanding of the topic 
 I ordered Rump Shaker and another Babes going Bananas Dvd, along with a Joe Pro: Still Crunk. The Joe pro was good. But both babes Going Bananas sucked. The girls looked bad, and they had the same scenes on both DVD's. The only thing different was that Ms. Cleo was in a different room. Do not buy this. If you want quality then go with the Joe Pro. 
 THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS MOVIE IS VERY INTERESTING....DONT FALL FOR IT. THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED HAPPEN- DONT GET ME WRONG; BUT IN A PLODDING AND TALENTLESS WAY. THE SUBTITLES MOVE VERY FAST AND INTERFERES WITH YOUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY " SEE " THE MOVIE. ACTING VERY SUB PAR AND STORY NOT DISTINCTIVE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT WORTH RECOMMENDING TO A FRIEND OR WATCHING AGAIN 
 This brief novel offers a rather pointless speculative fiction take on Conrad's Heart of Darkness. A ridiculous and under-explained premise is used to prop up some equally under-explained ruminations from Ballard on the human condition and spirituality. Here the action takes place in an African jungle that is becoming crystallized, as all objects slowly become encrusted with luminous jewels. Ballard doesn't explain how this process works except for some weak references to the "crystallized" time and space aspects of relativity. This implausible premise leads to curious changes in the people who also find themselves crystallized, with some sort of inner peace and spiritual fulfillment being found in the process, though Ballard leaves this aspect of the story anemic as well, other than some flimsy philosophical ramblings. Meanwhile, the action of the story mostly involves a pointless chase sequence connected to a blood feud between two shallow supporting characters, which is never resolved within the story. Add to all of this the book's outdated colonialist conceptions of the third world and its inhabitants, and the weak premise and theme of this novel retreat further into the crystal haze.

 I think this toy is great, my boys love it. Unfortunately the top of the train track pen after a couple of uses wouldn't come off. I tried everything. eventually the pen part cracked, and the whole think=g is useless. I can not seem to find a replacement for just the Track pen. It still works with the straight pen, but it just isn't the same. I am very dissapointed 
 I am an avid fan of the chipmunks. I was there when they first came out. I have the original 45's of The Witch Doctor, The Bird Sitting On My head which are really not the Chipmunks, but I have Alvins Harmonica and The christmas Song and Ragtime Cowboy Joe. I was disappointed when I listened to the first few songs on this album. They aren't the original recordings. I think that should be mentioned. I do have the Greatest HIts of the Chipmunks which are the originals, but they put only 10 or 11 songs on the cd and non of the David Seville songs. I know the original recordings are on Liberty records. I'm not sure if they are still around, but someone must have the original tapes. Lets get the original recordings on cd and not just 10 songs. I would definately get the Grestest hits with the 10 songs. At least they are the originals 
 Self-parody at its fines 
 I clearly do not share the enthusiasm of some of the reviewers here, who will all have to forgive me for thinking that Susan Cooper's "The Dark Is Rising" is plain awful. This book was recommended to Harry Potter fans who have run out of HP books to read. I must say it was a waste of my time to read "Dark."  Never have I read a book in which no physical description is given for the hero. In this case, we are told that on his 11th birthday, an English boy named Will Stanton discovers he is the last of "The Old Ones." Unlike JK Rowling who, in the first pages of Harry Potter & the Philosopher's (or Sorcerer's) Stone, provides the reader with a vivid description of Harry as skinny, with an unruly mop of black hair, startlingly green eyes, and, of course, a lightning-bolt scar on his forehead, Cooper does not describe Will Stanton at all. The result is that the reader, after having read 244 pages, still cannot visualize what Will looks like!!  I also find quite annoying Cooper's approach to this good vs. evil tale. She is vague and abstract till the end as to who exactly are The Old Ones, and who or what exactly is The Dark. As for The Dark being evil, all the reader succeeds in gleaning is that The Dark means cold, snow, and--of course--darkness. Excuse me: but is this the best Cooper can do?  Is this what this book is about?--the Druid pagan worldview of light vs. dark, summer vs. winter, warmth vs. cold? What happened to the conception of evil as MORAL evil? 
 The most boring text book I have ever read. info was not well presente 
 This book offers a historically very inaccurate, one-sided and propangandistic accounts of the Knights, intended to serve the nationalisitc purposes of the author 
 Maps are good, that's all. After 1 year in south america with both Footprint SA and South america on a shoestring, I can say the first one in much better (exept the maps). Not updated, the informations are not really useful...If you want to travel and to be just with gringos, buy this guide. 
 If you want to read 224 pages of someone telling you how tough they are and how bad they've had it in life, with very little about motorcycling, then this books for you!This book is written on about a 4th grade level with dirty words thrown in as if to show off that he's a "man". Save your hard earned money! 
 this may easily be one of the dumber movies made in the last hundred years.  and there were a lot of them.  this definitely ranks up in the 10%-tile 
 Who would read all these reviews, and then actually buy this book? This book is an unfair attempt at pandering to the doddling whims of a major portion of our population...the suckers...of which I am obviously one, because I did read the stupid book! It took me almost a year to get through it - one half paragraph at a time before I would fall asleep each night. If it wasn't for Jordan, I'd have a hard time going to sleep at all. It doesn't even deserve 1 star 
 They're young, hot, and dominating the charts.  But they just don't have what it takes to make a good holiday album.  Destiny's Child attempts to take traditional Christmas carols and make a modern, fan-geared holiday album.  And, sorry to say, but it just doesn't work here.  The album opens with the title track, which I'll admit is a catchy spin off of the original "12 Days of Christmas."  But the lyrics are ridiculous.  Example: "On the eighth day of Christmas my baby gave to me/A pair of Chloe shades and a diamond belly ring."  The next track, "Winter Paradise" is the best of the original tracks on the disc.  It's a more moderate R&B number that talks about Christmas memories.  It's pretty good.  But, "Spread a little love on Christmas" is about on the same level as the title track, but it focuses on all the other holidays going on at Christmas.  The girls DO get a few things right.  The ridiculously-titled "Opera of the Bells" (featured on the Victoria's Secret holiday commercial) is a slowed-down version of "Carol of the Bells," complete with nice harmonies that are actually quite enjoyable.  "This Christmas" is also complete with tight harmonies that give it an enjoyable spin and make it almost unrecognizable.  "A DC Christmas Medley" is a fun assortment of kid's Christmas carols, such as "Santa Claus is Coming to Town," "Frosty," and "Holly, Jolly Christmas."  And the best track on the disc, "Do You Hear what I Hear," is a wonderfully original take on the classic that doesn't wander too far from the original sound of it.  However, the album also takes a turn for the worst in a few places.  "Platinum Bells" is a ludicrous cover of "Siver Bells" that talks about the group's success (platinum albums).  And the cover of "The Little Drummer Boy" is absolutely laughable.  The girls don't even get the story right! ("And then he smiled at me/the little drummer boy smiled at me" -- correction... baby Jesus smiled at you, and YOU ARE the little drummer boy!)  Download the few good tunes off this album from I-tunes and save yourself the money of every single song on here.  Trust me, buying the whole CD is not worth it.  Best Song: "Do You Hear What I Hear" (great original take, true to classic song)  The good: "Winter Paradise" (enjoyable, laid-back original with good harmonies) "This Christmas" (a different take, very original) "A DC Christmas Medley" (it's fun) "Opera of the Bells" (nice harmonies)  The OK: "Silent Night" (pretty good, but Beyonce oversings it) "8 Days of Christmas" (catchy, but with stupid lyrics) "Spread a Little Love on Christmas" (ditto)  The bad: "The Little Drummer Boy" (at least get the story right) "White Christmas" (I don't like their version of this) "Platinum Bells" (too stupid to even laugh at... worst track on the album) "O Holy Night" (I'm very critical of covers of this song because it's my favorite Christmas tune and Michelle's voice just doesn't fit it 
 TOO BAD THERE WASN'T A RATING OF 0 STAR. THIS IS THE WORST PIECE OF JUNK I EVER BOUGHT. FIRST OF ALL WE WERE LOOKING FOR A BRAND CALLED SPORTS AFIELD. THIS ITEM FELL UNDER IT WHEN WE DID A SEARCH. WHEN IT ARRIVED IT WAS SOME OFF THE WALL BRAND.THEY WERE PAPER THIN BUT  THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WERE WARM BEING IT WAS FROM AN ARMY AND NAVY STORE. WRONG!!!!!!! THEY SERVED NO PURPOSE AT ALL.WERE NOT WARM AT ALL. .WE WASHED THEM PER DIRECTIOS ON TAG AND SHRUNK SO BAD I DON'T THINK A 2 YR OLD COULD FIT IN THEM.DO NOT BUY!!!!!!JUN 
 After Linda (the author) ties up her mare, and it struggles to the point of dropping in exhaustion, the rope cutting off the mare's airway, she ...  "found a small knife in the tack room and began cutting the rope that had subjected my troubled mare to this trauma, one I had set in motion seemingly with the best intentions. For the next week, she could barely walk, and when she was well enough to ride again, she had even less tolerance for the hitching post."  DUH!!!! This passage is found on page 11.  So, it was the rope's fault? And you could not be blamed because you had the "best intentions"? How stupid is this woman? She blindly took the quack advice given to her. Anyone with a modicum of horse sense knows you never tie up a horse like this. EVER.  How could tying up your horse and letting it panic as it tries to escape so it will submit to you be the "best intentions"?  I can't finish this book. Thank goodness this book showed its absurdity early on so I would not be subjected to reading more of it 
 The characters in this book are forever taking showers.  When they're not taking showers, they are either planning to take a shower, wishing they could take a shower, or telling each other to take a shower.    Why in the world does she make the main character, Kate, a scant *29* years old??  It's ridiculous.  Not only does she have an MD, she has at least one PhD.  And she has managed to reach the top of her field by 29.  But wait, there's more!  She also, during all this achievement, managed to squeeze out a baby at the tender age of TWENTY, and then raise it.  Uh huh.  Why does Johansen not just make Kate 39, and be a bit more realistic on all counts?  There is a hint early on when Kate muses that Benny, her ex-husband's new girlfriend, is only 23, which makes her so much more attractive than elderly Kate.  ARGH! Clearly, Johansen does not think a woman can be attractive at the advanced age of 39.  *snore*  How ridiculous 
 This was some of the most self-serving, melodramtic drivel I've read, well, ever.  I usually put garbage like this aside, but I'd just been to Belize and promised a friend I'd read it.  
 I bought this laundry sorter and loved it at first. The concept is great. The frame, however, did not hold up to our family of 6. After using it a short time, the whole unit started leaning. Now it tips over completely. It was only about $18. but it only lasted a few months in good condition. Next time, I'll go for the heavy duty laundry sorter 
 A review states the Mark Noll "loves God and loves academics".  In spite of his very impressive collection of books on religion, I feel he loves academics more.  This book is lifeless and seems to lack respect for 19th century religion and religious thought.  The prose is for academicians.  At no time will the author use a ten-letter word when he can find a twenty-letter one.  This is a book about religious intellectuals, saying very little about how the people felt or what they were hearing at services.  We move from one essays or debate or article to another, with little development or effort to access the impact of the item.  A problem could be that these items did not make a real impact, being nothing more than talking points on the road to war.  The author interjects his views and beliefs constantly, which seem very 21st century and totally out of place.  In an effort to "be inclusive" Catholics, Jews, Mormons and free Black churches are included.  This is interesting but the majority of America belong to four or five major churches where the crisis takes place.  Do we really care that the Mormons feel the failure to elect their leader President in 1856, brought on the Civil War?  This information and justification of the idea consumes about 1% of the book's text.  A good point is the discussion of the Biblical justification of slavery and the response of the abolitionists.   This helps understand how in an anti-slavery society, the abolitionists were still not accepted.  Their response was seen by the majority of Christians to reject the Bible's teachings.  This very important point if completely developed would have been a major contribution to the value of the book.  A real missed opportunity was to have a frank discussion of race in the years leading up to the war.  "The negro question" chapter never takes the "gloves off".  While suggested, the pervasive racial discrimination of 19th century America gets glossed over.  Little is said about the idea of colonization or the laws preventing Negros from living where they wished.  The author deals with slavery but refuses to detail the racism that is its' foundation.  Doing so, would have required a frank discussion of the plight of the Irish and Germans during this time.  Having just read Woodworth's excellent book on religion may color my view about this one.  The difference in approach, historical information and readability is remarkable. 
 I found this cookbook difficult to interpret.  I am not someone who can cook without specific instructions, and this cookbook does not provide them.  The pictures are good; the meals are good, but none of that matters if you can't figure out from the instructions how to make it.  It seemed like Shelley Young skipped a lot of the recipe instructions and assumed people would understand 
 This lifelong Cardinals fan managed to get through the book, but it's hard to imagine any non Cardinals fan who is not a speed reader doing the same. Though I am not an obsessive baseball fan (haven't seen a game even on TV for nearly 20 years), the in-game stategies Bissinger details are nothing surprising; in context, anyone, experienced or not, would seem likely to come up with them. Readers will learning virtually nothing here. To give Bissinger a break, it seems he agreed and perhaps signed a contract to write this book without realizing there would not be anything to say. Bissinger does not deserve a break for his criticisms of Lewis' "Moneyball," however. (The hardback edition of "3 Nights," perhaps, is not so strongly positioned against that far better book, but the paperback I read contains an afterword devoted entirely to trashing Lewis' book without (a) any understanding of it, (b) apparently, a rereading of it, and (c) any evidence whatsoever to butress Bissinger's "ya gotta have heart" position. Likewise, Bissinger deserves no break for the horribly bad, lazy prose here. Examples: Pujols is referred to in his first 20 or so mentions as "the great Pujols." No variations (not even "the really great") of the phrase are used. Page 275: a player plays "each and every game at five hundred percent." Page 254: a World Series victory is marked by a "Rubik's Cube of a hug." Page 243 (and elsewhere): "sultry hot," as if "sultry" does not imply "hot." Page 224: "white hair as finely woven as pasta." This is the kind of writing folks compose deliberately to win bad writing contests. Disappointingly, the paperback edition, at least, doesn't even have any pictures. Stay away from this one 
 This book is good for a quick overview of some valuation methods, but I found it to be a little too simplified, although it's not bad for mom-and-pop retail and service businesses. If you are actually don't going to do the calculations and want more professional results, take a look at "Unlocking the Value of Your Business". 
 I thought this book was silly.  I didn't like how it was written.. 
 Terrible retelling of what makes New Oleans special.  Codrescu's account shows what's wrong with the city before and after the great storm.  He is a tourist, do not look to him for insight into our great city. 
 Dust is the first attempt I made at a Martha Grimes novel.  Page 74 is point where I am tossing the book aside.  OK, someone was killed.  Many people knew him, although I can not remember  any of them.  Who are all these other people and what do they bring to the story?  I know this is a novel in a series, but most authors can bring a new reader up to speed fairly early in a novel.  I also can't figure out what is so important about Jury getting busy with most of the female characters.  Is it a mystery novel or a Harlequin romance?  Looks like I'll be skipping any other Richard Jury novels 
 Loved the magazine, but after two years of it, the onslaught of mostly bare-chested men both in the mag and on the cover was too much.  Where are the women?  If it is targeting the gay audience, please say so.  Each month, I'd count the number of men vs. women photos and there are very few women.  Just unshaven boys.  Not my cup of tea, so my subscription hasn't been renewed 
 Personally, I like the other albums from Staind. I love "Dysfunction", I like "Break the Cycle", "14 Shades..." was tolerable, and I really enjoyed "Chapter V". However, even for a debut, "Tormented" just sounds inmmature. There's emotion, but I lost count on the how many times the "f-word" is not only mentioned on the album, but on each song alone. Then again, Fred Durst produced this band in the first place, so that probably had a lot to do with it. All in all, the album itself just flat out sucks 
 Oliver Stone proves to be just as reliable as a social critic as he is a "historian."    PLATOON and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY were great films but JFK, though brilliantly made, was a sign that something was off about Stone's mental processes.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS could have been a scathing indictment of our media's obsession with violence and decadence...but instead it's just Exhibit A in the indictment, wallowing in the filth it tries to satirize 
 tried using this book to research my collection-too many errors in it to do the job-collectors should avoid-OK for some of the basics-country data not bad-better info on web/gun mag 
 The first few reviews are too harsh,I was given this as a gift so I am not as pissed off at the money. I give it two stars could have been three but for the fact that the hero's are way too perfect and they are dull- but it was not a book I expected much from anyway.  The plot also gets way to over the top.  I mean is there any plane or helicopter they cannot learn to fly in a weekend? Hero's invited to the summit by the President! They escape four attempts to kill them before they even get to China! Also hero knew the guy was Chinese just by looking at him for a less than a minute, how many white folks can tell difference among non whites? Why are all the Chinese Americans bad guys as well?   The novel is way to heavy with anit Chinese comments, has lot of what are just rants. See the other points in the publisher weekly review, but after considering them you may want to read the book, if you want to consider what we do if we and china butt heads, but have low expectation and know that in this world the good guys always win. Do not expect much and look for used copy, I paln to look to see if any of his other books get any better reviews before I cut him off. 
 Do not use this product.  It is very hard to remove from your computer.  It is harder to install than Norton, and is an inferior product.  I will never buy their product again. 
 OK......... right off the bat, we normally LOVE psychological thrillers that make you think as opposed to mindless "6 kids in the woods getting slashed" type garbage. However SUBLIME fails on many levels....  1) You know what the story is going to be 15 minutes into the film, so there is no element of surprise as the end develops.  2) SPOILER ALERT......................... ....................................... .......................................... The "dream"/"hallucination" (trying to not spoil too bad) scenes lose all creepiness because they are simply silly and stupid as opposed to frightening.  3) All the characters are so odd, you really never care for George, his wife, his kids or anybody for that matter.  All in all it came across as a movie trying to be very "artsy-fartsy" and trying to create mystery by editing together random and erratic hallucinatory sequences simply for the sake of being confusing as opposed to being intriguing storytelling.  We were suckered in by the fact that one of the Producers of the TV show "24" was involved in this project. But that did not help this film at all.  
 most boring of the barbie movies, i am sure glad my daughter has stopped asking to watch it over and over. and when it is so boring it seems to drag on forever. and i agree with another reviewer, princess and the pauper and rapunzel, much better!!! 
 (Note: Rather than use the European name "Jesus", I will use Issa, as he was called in India, and Y'shua, as he was called in Judea).  I was interested in this book because I was already inclined toward the ideas that Issa/Y'shua spent time in India and that he survived the crucifixion. Surprisingly, I seem to be the only reviewer who welcomes the author's evidence of these points, but is displeased with his slant.  Much of this book is about Islam, which was founded 600+ years after the time of Issa/Y'shua, and is therefore not relevant to the history being studied. The author's imposition of Islamic thought clouds the facts being presented.   The author attempts to examine Buddhism, which Issa was said to have studied in India. He aligns Islam with "eastern religions" (without mentioning Hinduism) rather than Christianity. But Buddhists essentially strive for spiritual enlightenment, while Christians and Muslims primarily worship God. Y'shua's closest associates in Judea were the Essene Nazirenes, who were more enlightenment oriented than others in Judea at the time. A philosophic connection between Buddhism and the Nazirenes would have been a more relevant line of research.   There is a quote from "the last survivor of a long line of the hereditary attendants of the tomb", saying that the body in the tomb was that of Issa. Fine, but why is that the only quote from that person? Who were these attendants? Were they descendants of Issa? Were they assigned by Issa to maintain the tomb per his instructions? And why did they leave it? It is mentioned a few times in this book that a mysterious aroma used to emanate from a hole at the tomb. When did it stop? Were the hereditary attendants asked about it? I wonder why this information wasn't included.   In another context, there is mention of a blood line in India, but the theory is that Issa/Y'shua was celibate throughout his youth, and in his old age sired children with a servant. This is hard to believe. If he had taken an Indian wife on his first trip to India, this would add another dimension to our understanding of why he might have returned to India later. Limited accounts of his first trip say he didn't, but it might have been kept secret if she were of a lower caste (thus described as a servant). In this book, the only question asked of a descendant is about written documentation of the marriage. I would like to have known about the beliefs and family lore of the descendants.  Issa's philosophy, teachings, and wishes regarding maintenance of his tomb, are all brushed aside. But opinions of Muslims are discussed at length. It seems the purpose of this book is less to reveal the truth about Issa/Y'shua than to claim his legacy for Islam 
 I was anxious to read the books written by this author since they take place near Charleston, a place we visit often.  I was very disappointed!  This book should have ended about 3 chapters earlier.  The book lacked depth and character development.  The dialogue was contrite and superficial.  I will definitely NOT be reading anymore books from this author 
 I read this book because it won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1983.  It is, I believe, the least intersting and most esoteric book I have ever read.  It reminded me of my reading of Fin-de-Siecle Vienna, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1981, and which I long wanted to read and then when I read it I found it a chore to read, and greatly welcomed the last page.  The last chapter of Transformation made no sense for me at all, and reading this book's only significance is that I have read another Pulitzer Prize winner in history.  I thought I should warn persons who might be overly influenced by the other 3 reviews and might think this would be a great book to read 
 Most of the recipes not at all simple, as claimed in the subtitle. I know hors d'oeuvres are frequently finiky and labor-intensive, but I wanted to believe the claim of simplicity made on the cover. It ain't so. Just made  the recipe for "Anchoiade Dip With Crudites" which winds up the  consistency of a vinaigrette. I suppose you could use it as a dip, if you  want it dripped all over the carpet. It's a good dressing but to present it  as a dip is silly. Also, this particular recipe is careless. It calls for       "2 ounces (2 tins) anchovy fillets..." The tins of anchovies I  buy are 2 ounces net. Doubling (or not) an ingredient in a small recipe is  not trivial, especially if it's anchovies. The recipe for  "Cumin-Spiced Carrots" was a disappointment, too. The flavors  involved didn't seem to amount to much. My reaction is this is another  pot-boiler compendium of other peoples' recipes, untested by the editor 
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 I may be the one guy out there that does not like his books.   What makes me mad is that I have heard so much good press I was excited about this book.   The story sounded like it would be full of interesting stories and the duel plot was new, but it really did not rise to the occasion.   I found the writing wooden and he just does not hold my attention.  It takes a lot of time (or it seams that way) to get through this book.   I do not know what slowed me down more; the disjointed writing or the two plots that seamed to just be thrown together.   I did not believe the characters; they just were not well developed. I only made it about half way into the book.    This book seams rushed, almost like the author did not want to take the time to really develop either the story or the characters.   Because of the light development it does not hold your attention 
 The disapearance of USSR was terrible for Tom Clancy - it deprived Jack Ryan of real evil enemy so the author had to invent some new ones. After going through the Japanese and the Arabs he couldn't find nothing better than... vegetarians!!!  This whole book is a pathetic joke! Good Lord, when I think that once I actually DIDN't sleep for 48 hours because I couldn't stop reading "The Cardinal of Kremlin". Mr Clancy Sir  you were so great in the past - what happened? Now every next of your books is simply worse than the previous... And just to be clear - politically I am as much on the right (Republican) side than you, so this is not just the hostility of a political enemy but a sincere disappointment of a former fan Could you try to write something good once more? In memory of good old times? Please? 
 I echo the former review.  The filter becomes clogged almost immediately and the motor starts to overheat.  I don't know what this thing is meant to suck up, but it sure is useless on hair and small particles, dust, cat litter, sawdust, etc..  It was a waste of money and I should have returned it right away 
 Given its price, I purchased this laundry hamper NOT expecting a top of the line solution to my laundry needs but this hamper didn't even meet my lower expectations.  The materials are cheap and flimsy, and under any kind of strain, the screws have a tendency to come loose and it jerks front and back when you pull it across the shortest of carpet.  If you are going to use it for laundry, look for something else more durable.  It might work for non-laundry functions (i.e. recycling) 
 In a rush I read the great reviews on the back of the book and thus decided to start reading this book but I soon realized the great reviews are not justified by this book. I took another look at the back and saw that the reviews are ment for the author's "The Bookseller of Kabul". If I had not been misled she might have gotten another star from me 
 After using the dryer (which I liked very much and did a quick job), I discovered that my hair was being ruined.  It would break off in small 2 inch curved pieces.  I stopped using it for a month and confirmed that was the problem because the lavatory was no longer filled with broken pieces of hair.  I would like to return it and get my money back!!!   
 I received this book over a month after I ordered it.  I ordered it early so I would have it in time to start class.  Obviously that didn't happen.  The book has been cut (missing pictures and text) and is in poor condition.  I don't believe I would order from these people again 
 I bought this as a travel charger for my Blackberry. All I can say is awful, awful, awful. I followed instructions in the manual (which are pretty easy) and charged up the Solio. After waiting twice as long as required, I tried to plug it into my Blackberry 7250 to see how it charged--big mistake. Not only did it not charge a weird red "battery" icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed. I tried this routine several times over several days with the same result, rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous. Finally, I had enough and told the customer service for Solio that I was returning it. Not only did they never return my money (I had to call my CC company to handle it) no one ever said what the problem could be. My advice: Stay away from this thing--it may seen cool or environmentally friendly, but it is junk a piece of over-priced junk 
 Mona Charen cites nearly every example of demagoguery committed by social liberals from 1960 to 1996.  She didn't miss one.  She bashes liberal views of the Great Society of LBJ, the anti-war protests of the 60's, the welfare state, Clarence Thomas' and Robert Bork's nominations, and the crime wave that quieted in the 90's.  Unfortunately, Charen forgets the similar pandering and hypocrisy that has occurred by social conservatives during that same period, an omission that greatly detracts from her thesis.  Another failing is that she attaches exclusive causeology  of NYC's decrease in crime in the 1990's to Guiliani's get-tough policies, and conveniently forgets the complexities of improved economics, changing demographics and the "abortion factor" (as expounded by Leavitt in Freakonomics) as potential contributors.    She glibly assigns culpability to liberals for any number of social ills including unwed mothers, homelessness, violent crime, racial tension and conceiveably ring-around-the-collar.  Her references are numerous, but her arguments are not careful enough for a scholarly work, so the book serves only as red meat for the angry masses screaming about the same old problems of government waste associated with liberal government bureaucracy.  Charen conveniently avoids the huge government waste associated with the current so-called "conservative" government of GWB and the Republican House and Republican Senate.  Charen forgets to cite the Medicare Part D program as the largest social spending  program (inflation adjusted) in history.  She forgets to mention that GWB signed into law a bill written by fellow "conservative" Republicans that represented the largest farm subsidies (inflation adjusted) in history.  Charen neglects to mention that the current "conservative" government has rushed us into a war that will cost half a trillion dollars and has already lasted longer than WWI, WWII and the US Civil War; and Bush did this despite protests by previous Republican cabinet advisors and diplomats.     At the end of the day, this conservative prefers a government that wastes billions of my tax money on unnecessary and counter-productive social programs over one that spends trillions on unnecessary war and mayhem 
 I have been a King fan since the mid-70s so I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of his new book.  Like others posted before me, I got the book, ran home, got snuggled down for a good King read, and prepared to be enthralled.  Well, by page 30 I was sick and tired of all the cutesy sayings and pet names everyone had for the everyday things in life; I also got tired of having to look back in the book to remember what 'SOWISA' meant; and I got tired of reading "smucking, smucked, smucker", whatever.  I long for the days of King when he was writing such greats as "'Salem's Lot," "The Shining," and, of course, "The Stand."  I am sorry to say that I think Steve has run out of great ideas and I'm just huh-yoogely glad I got this smucking book from the smucking library rah-cheer rather than buying it 
 This book was a disappointment because if does not offer anything new, just basic common sense.  In many ways it is just a re-hash of similar  books and magazine articles.    
 I was very excited to read this book as I have been looking for a biblically sound book I might be able to give away to friends to challenge their thinking about birth-control and children.  I am so sad to say that in the first two chapters there were three Scriptures which were so BADLY taken out of context, I was forced to put the book down.  When I picked it up again and began to read through the entire book, I found this unqualified biblical exegesis to be unfortunately common.    One example:  Mrs. Campbell uses Romans 7:4 as a support for God's purpose that marriage bring forth children.  Actually, this verse speaks of our being united with CHRIST, not a woman being united with a man in marriage.  Furthermore she interprets the idea of bearing fruit (in the same verse) as meaning we much bear children.  All throughout the NT you can see that bearing fruit is a spiritual metaphor for growing in Christlike-ness.    Another example: Mrs. Campbell uses Jer. 29 to support the same idea that God's intent for marriage is to produce children.  However, the immediate context of this passage is Jeremiah contradicting the current false proohets who were saying that Israel should get ready to return to Jerusalem.  God is saying through Jeremiah that Israel should continue with life as usual (marrying, having babies, planting crops and harvesting and so on...) because they were going to remain in exile for the full 70 years.  I was disappointed with book because I was eager to hear a clear biblical presentation about why trusting God with your family size is biblical and God-honoring.  There is no such solid biblical teaching in these pages.  I don't think I would even recommend it for browsing.  "A Full Quiver" (Hess) gets much closer, although this is not a whole-hearted endorsement of that book either.  May the Lord raise up someone who knows how to properly use the Scriptures in context to write on this topic 
 This edition may be contains 30 seconds of extra material that I had to watch 3 times to make sure was there! Stick with the original!  Go Sox!!!  But all that said this is a must have movie ..any version you can get. 
 My report was done on Bradbury Speaks Too soon from the cave, too far from the stars. At first this book looked very interesting. It said it would talk about space and how we would get to it and how far have we really come from earlier man. But I was proven wrong by the book. The book discusses Bradbury's life and how he met important people and interviews that went into the stuff described but it was really not at all about the future and space. That was the first sign of trouble. I then began to actually read the book. Oh boy was that hard. The context of the literature is so hard to understand. This was one of the most challenging books I have ever read. It wasn't hard language it was just the way he used it. I struggled all the way through this book just trying to understand what the heck he meant. When I finally did start too understand the book was still a huge bore.  All he would write about was himself and for all I could read about this book it didn't say anywhere that this was an autobiographical book. It says that the stories are written by students and journalists that have Bradbury. But they all sound like they are his words. Like that they are all in first person and they don't come from an interviewer's point of view. This really ticked me off. This book was down right hard. Now the stories themselves were really difficult. He wrote as if he had no personality. Giving only facts and making the stories dull and uninteresting. Half of them I couldn't even understand what they were about. They are so factual and have absolutely now pizzazz to them. This book gave me a sense of that no one knows what's going to happen to the human race. The book made me both sad and crazy. Crazy because he can't go directly to the point with out having a confusing remark that sent you off another road of thinking. So you would forget all about what you just read and have to start all over again. This is a book that requires too much attention from one person. All the stories talk about is how he met important people and how he likes the rain. Witch is really stupid. The book followed nothing from what you expect it to be. I would now read it if I were you. If you want a really good book about the future past and present don't look here. But if you are looking for a dull boring something you would read if you had to this would be the book for you. I lost interest in the book since the first page but I had to keep going because it was for school. Other wise I wouldn't bother with the book. I mean even the really weird Hitchcock films were better that this book. I would sit through one thousand Star Wars Episode I movies if I could not read this book again. I would not suggest this book for my life!  
 Star Parker opens the door to subjects we, Americans of African descent, need to critically consider. Why are we still debating issues that the Liberals have promised they would fix - for years. Why are out-of-wedlock births epidemic in the communities of color? When did being conservative mean you had to abandon intellectual honesty for liberalism? Why do we have these media appointed "black leaders" that have no connection to our daily lives? Why does the title "Reverend" have the power to cloud the minds of black folk and bestow upon them omnipresent knowledge?   I have needed to read this book for a long, long time. For all us, Americans of African descent, take heart someone speaks the truth if you would just consider 
 Once again, Miss Marple has been twisted into a character beyond recognition as Agatha Christie's hero.  However, whereas in the Rutherford Marple movies, which were comedy bordering on slapstick, these are rather like Creepshow adapted to Christie.  I have watched each of these 'new' Marples out of a rather morbid curiosity, and have been deeply disappointed each time.  I can't comment on Ms. McEwan's talents, as I don't remember her in other parts.  Here, she appears so addled that one wonders how she finds her own home!  Rather than allowing the plots to set the atmosphere of the episodes, the cameramen have been given full play to show what might pass for sinister, low-placement lighting to create an atmosphere.  Unfortunately, that hasn't worked in movies in decades.  Miss Christie may not have been Dickens for the 20th century, but her great body of work as an aggregate deserves better treatment than this.  Rather reminds me of those who perform Shakespeare in the nude or some other gimmick because they have nothing else to offer.  This work is so far afield of Christie's writing that the lead could've been named anything they wanted, rather than Marple.  Disrespectful 
 Although what a book says is perhaps the most pressing sphere in which to evaluate it, the way those words are presented can sometimes, sadly, eclipse the content.  This is one of those unfortunate books, cast asunder before it was even fully born. The crime: body text in sans-serif! And not only that, but on glossy pages. I could almost handle the typeface, but it does, truly, give me a headache. Add in the somewhat patchy editing and it makes for a lot of frustration.  A fascinating book with fascinating content. If only I could read it for more than a few minutes at a time. If, like me, you are one of those who refuses to purchase books printed in horrible, difficult-to-read fonts: this is one of them 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 Book assumes basic knowledge of layers manipulation which I don't have. Further frustration; several editing procedures which are mentioned as part of the book are only available on the Internet after filling out a registration and market survey. To top it off I could find no such information at the site specified after I went through the aggravation of completing the required registration and survey. 
 I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life 
 i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
 I saw this at the library and brought it home, thinking it might be interesting to watch. I very rarely watch films made after the 1950's, but this one looked as if it could be enjoyable. It ended up being only mildly enjoyable, and a bit boring. I felt that within all the time it ran, we didn't really get a good understanding of the inner being of the main characters; seemed to remain in shallow waters all along. The film was sort of good...pretty photography,and for the most part it seemed like the costumes, hair, way of speaking, etc. were accurate for the time period (so often such movies are so obviously modern people dressed up and pretending to be from way back when) but something just wasn't quite right, and it is hard to know exactly what it was. I was surprised and disappointed that there was quite a long scene with male nudity which to me was quite unnecessary and inappropriate. I think the whole swim scene could have been done effectively without showing full nudity. I am grateful the women in the film remained properly clothed. So I would not recommend this film for families with young  children, because of the nudity. 
 When I read this book's description on Amazon I thought this might be an interesting read, and so I checked this book out through Michigan's interlibrary loan system.  I read part of the introduction then promptly returned this book to the library.  If I had bought it, I would have promptly thrown it into the garbage can.  Greenberg claims that his views are in line with current scholarly consensus, but in actually his views are far from mainstream.  Not that being out of the mainstream is bad, but Greenberg twists wording to fit his own theories.  He starts out talking about the Documentary Hypothesis, but that is where his views and those of mainstream scholars end.  He is also the author of "The Moses Mystery" which basically claims that the Israelites borrowed their monotheistic religion from the Egyptian sun-cult.  There is absolutely no archaeological or empirical evidence to support this claim.  All the claims made in this book are based on that assumption.  I am open to new ideas and theories, but when a claim is based on no evidence or, at best, semi-circumstantial evidence, that claim is worthless, and so is this book 
 It took me over two months to finish this book. Obviously some serious research went into the perfume making part, but otherwise much of the historical and geographical detail is wrong. This would be nothing if it were a compelling read. It is not. The protagonist, Grenouille, is empty. I did not like him, love him, hate him, admire him, despise him, fear him. Quite an achievement for a serial killer. I did not feel sorry for his victims either.  In fact, I did not feel anything for any of the characters. But maybe that was the author's point 
 Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy. Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues). 
 i bought this unit and it was a piece of junk . It omitted way to much ozone which is the same as omitting smog in your house. That is what the smell is that comes from this unit. Please research ozone emitting air purifiers before you buy one. try google. When I tried to returned it a week after buying it Ionic Zone would not respond to my emails and I had to go through Amazon to get a refund. This unit is noisy and useless!! 
 Puuhlease! It's cute but why would you want to waste your time with a second-rate Depeche Mode wannabe synth pop group? If you want the real deal, check out some early Depeche Mode and Duran Duran 
 Sorry, but the title says it all.  I think that the code samples are horrible.  You spend more time trying to figure out how he coded his VB than you do actually learning how to use it.  The VB samples are full of error handling procedures that will have you running in circles trying to figure out the useful parts.  I already know how to use Access. This is not the most useful book for learning to create VB code for handling access DB's.  It is, however, a great reference book, and if you can piece together the samples of VB code, you can eventually figure it out.  Overall this book was more technical than I needed 
 Was rather of a long story and sometimes hard to read as it doesn't get to the point quick. But I did get one good idea from it so there was some value in it for me 
 This is a short biographical essay on John XXIII sandwiched between pages and pages of anti-papal screed and pseudo-history.  I have read all of the author's "Hinges of History" series, but will read him no more; Mr. Cahill's bias and cant are a barrier to the necessary trust between author and reader. Here's the book in a nutshell: reforming/liberal popes = good, conservative/traditional popes = bad. I am exaggerating only a little in my encapsulation! The author frequently substitutes assertion for argument, particularly in regard to the current pope, John Paul II. After re-reading the book, I am still unsure what it is that the author dislikes so much about the current pope except that he appears to be holding the line on traditional Catholic teaching.  For all the much-vaunted tolerance of liberal believers, I was shocked by the author's repeated ad hominem attacks upon the character of popes and others who take views not sanctioned by the author.  As for Mr. Cahill's liberal utopia, I suggest that he look at the Episcopal Church in the US for a picture of what the Church will look like if we vote on our doctrine and elect our bishops; I don't think it is an improvement!  This book is a perfect example of the saying that "when orthodoxy becomes optional, orthodoxy will soon be prohibited."  I have tried but cannot understand those (like the author) who want to belong to an organization with which they completely disagree and then want to make the organization over in their own image. There are plenty of non-hierarchical denominations out there if Mr. Cahill truly wants one. I recommend that you avoid this book or read only that portion of it dealing directly with John XXIII.  A more scholarly alternative from the same perspective without the cant is Eamon Duffy's Saints and Sinners 
 This is a comic book.  Based on the the novels "The Fellowship of the Ring" and "The Two Towers".  It is only 7 inches tall 4 inches wide and 3/8 of an inch thick.  It is printed on thick slick paper 
 To "Hinkle Goldfarb's" review, I would like to add several observations. Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not? I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative! Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists. 
 This is a great collection of games but not enough meat. Any grandmaster can do analysis like this with Fritz. I expected a lot more 
 Tom Robbins writes self-consciously quirky drivel.  I tried to read "Still Life with Woodpecker," for the sole purpose of tallying every time he points out the fact that the two protagonists are redheads (at least once every five pages), but I'm just not enough of a masochist for it.  Don't read Tom Robbins.  Read "Catch-22", "One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest", or "Breakfast of Champions" instead 
 Memorex Jewel case arrived with many cases broken, the TKD is has probably thicker and more duarabl 
 I was really looking forward to recieving these "MEMORY FOAM" slippers. When they arrived I was EXTREMELY disappointed to discover that they only had a "RUBBER" sole with terry cloth. (The terry cloth and color were beautiful and the size 11 narrow was great on the fit.)  I hope the factory just forgot to put the memory foam in this particular pair of slippers because if that is not the case then this company is guilty of false and misleading claims in their online product discription, as well as, the discription on the attached tag.  I returned these slippers the day after they arrived and am still in search of a pair of slippers WITH real memory foam that the wearer can actually feel 
 I have used the product for 2 months, and it just hasn't worked. My problem is just as bad as it was before I started using it. I am glad it works for others, but I just can't give it more than one star. 
 There is no way this man can be serious.  This book is a joke, it has to be.  It's been a while since I've read it, but while I was reading, I found myself literally marking passages with a pen that were ridiculous, absurd, sometimes bordering on insane.  I can't believe that anyone in their right mind could read this book as anything but parody.  The Enemy Within is not only asinine, but it is also an incredible waste of time - full of pointless anectodes and machismo, rife with typical conservative name calling, Michael Savage is so representative of what is wrong with America today.    Ignorant, bigoted, idiotic.  If these words fit you, you might enjoy The Enemy Within 
 Once I read the description on the author, about how she's a screenwriter, it all makes sense.  I mean this in the sense that the text is not lyrical.  It's just there to serve the purpose of conveying the plot, nothing else.  There's no poetry to the writing.  Like many have said already, the characters lack depth, the plot is not much more than a soap opera, the recipes are added to the writing almost as an afterthought (they're just dropped in), and the ending is so forced and abrupt and ODD, that the book just left me feeling like I wasted my time reading it.  I did find the smattering of information about the Mexican revolution interesting.  Maybe I'm too much of a realist and enjoy nonfiction too much, but this story just was not for me 
 This book is a good one......I guess. The reason why I am not sure is that I have had this book for over a year now and I still havent managed to read it completely. Everytime I start reading it, it loses my interest after the third chapter. The authour would have been happier writing poetry about the LAB colour space. He keeps ranting on and on and on about the LAB colour space but when it comes to actually teaching you something new he does it in less than half the pages of the book. It gets to the point where the reader just goes - Ok, LAB is THE colour space to work in, now would you please stop telling me that after every other paragraph? Too much uselss information and very less practical knowledge 
 this is the third Chris Botti CD i purchased and listened to.  i think Botti is a great trumpeter.  on PBS' Legend of Jazz series, his performance with the PBS house band was amazingly good.  i never heard or saw him perform in pure jazz setting and may be Botti was awared that the PBS audience is quite jazz sophisticated thus he returned to the root of jazz and did a serious jazz rendition. that performance was the BEST of everything i heard from Botti.  the trio really helped bringing about Botti's Jazz ability.  sadly, in all his CDs, including this one, Botti applied the mechanical background "noise" (uninspiring back up) and it is totally artificial, lack of improvization and lack of swing.  without improvisation and swing, there is no Jazz. the PBS performance proved to me that Botti has all the capacity of a jazz artist but he is making pop to earn his mercedes.    i hope Botti build on from his PBS appearance and make a CD with a conventional trio setting. no more mechanical electronic beat machine, artificial arrangement and also, DROP THE SYNTHEZISER noise at the back. let the trumpet do the talking, Count Basie proved that silence is the best and most difficult music to play. let the improvisation element go, let it swing a bit more.    fantastic artist but extremely disappointing "jazz" production.  1 star.  
 This is truly a bizarre book. The previous entries in this series are mostly "G" rated romps/mysteries revolving around Jordan Poteet, a small town librarian in Texas who stumbles into capers much like Barney Fife, with minimal violence, swearing, etc. In this book Jordan is invited by his newly discovered biological father to a family "reunion" on a somewhat remote island off the coast of Texas. With some trepidation and his girlfriend Jordan makes the trip and the farce begins. Upon his arrival Jordan learns there is a significant inheritance at stake in his "new" family, who all consume copious amounts of alcohol and there are "secrets" that everyone seems to be aware of except for poor Jordan. When one of his new found relatives dies at the dinner table Jordan realizes that this reunion has become more than he bargained for but the truth  must be uncovered... by him. The book then turns into a bad reality TV show with accusations and fur flying. The "mystery" is eventually solved but what is clear by the end of the book is that "nothing is the same" anymore for Jordan. In hindsight the author has at the very least put this series on hiatus, (how many life and death situations can a small town librarian stumble across?), and maybe this was his way of "killing off" his protagonist without actually doing it. If you enjoyed the previous books in this series I'm not sure you'll enjoy this one. 
 I just wanted to write again to comment on the ignorance of a Mr. Alex Hernandez. This won't take long, read his review for the new all that remains album, then go and read the reviews for the other albums he has reviewed ( i.e - savage garden, coal chamber, and staind ) I think we can all safely push the review that this musically ignorant individual has placed before us very far aside. Way to go Alex, Savage Garden Rocks 
 I had my twins at 35 after fertility treatments and still had a difficult time relating to the woman in this book. Not because I like things sugar-coated or pretend that motherhood is always a bed of roses. But for a far better written realistic account of how tough new babies can be on your psyche,read Anne Lamott's Operating Insructions. Judith Newman had a charmed life, with the full time nanny and never bothering to breastfeed even one week,even though the babies were preemies and one had very serious weight gain issues for months.There are some funny lines, but mostly I just found myself disgusted with her and being happy i checked it out from the library instead of buying it 
 umm how can a so called child of god put out a explict album and play it off as if hes some big christian with that song jesus walks  im sure if jesus was here to see this he would be dissapointed because it seems all that mr west is trin to do is use jesus as a marketing tool to the music its not good at all id advise you to listen to something else anything id rather listen to apples in sterio 
 this book is just a collection of too many thing without a deeper insight. at least for circuit design, john uyemura's book will give you a much organized presentation 
 This is a dumb boring movie. I actually think this movie would be better to watch in 2d than 3d. The 3d in this movie sucks badly, and in order to really appreciate the campiness of the bad acting, direction, characters, and storyline-- one must not be waiting in eager anticipation for 3d scenes that simply do not deliver.   If you are looking for good 3d--PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS. THESE "REVIEWERS" WHO REVIEW THIS MOVIE EITHER HAVE AN AFFILIATION WITH THE STUDIO THAT RELEASED IT OR SIMPLY HAVE NOT REALLY EXPERIENCED ANY GOOD 3D MOVIES AND ARE JUST REVIEWING OUT OF IGNORANCE.   The field sequential in this movie is horrible, due mostly to the fact that so much of the movie takes place indoors- inside small cramped looking rooms that do not offer up any depth of field!! I dont care if the entire movie is shot in field sequential......if there is no depth to the picture...then there is no REAL 3D!  If you are looking for BEYOND EXCELLENT 3d, then get yourself a copy of "Alien Adventure", "Encounter in the Third Dimension", or "The Haunted Castle". I have reviews of all these movies movies in my profile.....  I love horror, I love 3D, and I love cult and B movies but this movie just could NOT hold my interest for long.  I have stopped and started it 3 times since I have received it, and have yet to finish the end of the movie.   Again.....maybe in 2d--but stay away from the lousy 3D version.  It downright sucks 
 I'm going to try to make this short and sweet,and although for the most part I am a fan of many of Ron Howard's films,this one is a bit of a dud.True,the special effects and fire scenes give this film some pizzaz,but not enough to warrent it a 3,4 or 5 star rating.I am in the fire profession myself and I can tell all of you that the action scenes are almost 100% unrealistic and phoney.If any of the things were attempted in real life as seen on screen,Kurt Russel and his crew would have died early on in the begining of the film.The acting was mediocre at best(mostly due to the poorly written script)and really...the best and most interesting characters and parts in the film were portrayed by Robert Deniro as the Fire Inspector and Donald Sutherland as the convicted pyromaniac.Not nearly enough time was spent on them or in the film for that matter.It in fact was probably the most realistic part of the movie at all.All in all,if you want some medioce entertainment and a "macho" portral of Firefighters this one does deliver.Personally,of all the Ron Howard films made,this is my least favorite and is at the bottom of my list.I pretty much hated this film.Not only for its inaccurate portral of the firefighter profession,but because when it came out,every macheesemo guy out there who had something to proove wanted to be a firefighter and the job market was flooded with recruits that had the wrong idea about what being a firefighter is really all about.Its not about rushing into a burning building to be the hero.Most firefighter who are heros are "dead" heros.Firefighting is ranked amongst the most dangerous professions and is for a very good reason.Backdraft is full of hot air and allot of blow hard B.S.To date,there has been no good or accurate depiction of a Firefighter put to film.Maybe one day 
 We all know Repbulicans don't care much for the environment, and now we're chopping down trees to give more praise to a man whose son's ambition is paid for with American lives. Why was this book written? Are trhe Bush-Kochs suddenly strapped for cash?    The book, if you can focus on a father and daughter that aren't dripping with wealth and power, is good enough. I like GHWB, voted for him, but the lovefest is going way overboard.   And as for the $500 billion dollar aircraft carrier (the tenth and final Nimitz-class supercarrier) just commisioned and named after George, Sr---it was absolutely wrong to do so. The man CVN-77 should have been named after is Admiral James B. Stockdale. Admiral Stockdale, a distinguished naval aviator and test pilot flight instructor, flew over 240 carrier-based missions, earned 28 combat decorations, and after being shot down over North Vietnam in 1965, spent 8 years as a P.O.W., 4 years in leg irons, 2 years in complete darkness, tortured and beaten daily. It is amazing that he didn't go blind after 2 years in darkness, malnourished and sleeping on concrete. Despite all of his pain, his primary concern was always the welfare of his fellow prisoners and that they received enough food and proper medical care. Stockdale even organized a hunger strike when one prisoner was denied medical treatment. At one point, he knew that one of his fellow P.O.W.s was guilty of an infraction that would possibly lead to that prisoner's execution. His captors knew Stockdale knew who the guilty prisoner was, and tortured Stockdale without mercy. Knowing there would be more torture and fearful he would crack and give out the prisoner's name, Stockdale attempted suicide. Rather than bear the thought of one of his fellow prisoners being executed or subjected to the pain that was inflicted on him, he tried to take his own life. Stockdale's suicide attempt was unsuccessful, yet in the attempt, was the ultimate statement about Admiral James B. Stockdale, that he would rather have died than see a fellow American soldier suffer pain or death at the hands of their captors. That maybe true about GHWB, but perhaps not so about our current President. Adwarded the Congressional Medal of Honor in 1976, Admiral Stockdale died in July of 2005. Even GHWB would tell you that CVN-77 should have been named after Admiral Stockdale.   Why isn't that in your book, Doro? On October 7th, 3 days after your book was released, you christened the USS George H.W. Bush, CVN-77. It rained that day. So much so that the ceremony was closed to the public 
 I bought this book for an advanced marketing class in my MBA program. The authors explain in detail the elementary topics which are covered in basic marketing class. For e.g. they talk in detail about segmentation, but they fail to explain thoroughly clustering and factor analysis.The tutorial also lacks depth and does not interpret the numbers 
 Usually I skip over album reviews if they are too extreme (5 or 1 star).  But it's quite called for here.  CAN A MAN RAP WITH ANY LESS CHARISMA??!!    Cam's come quite a long ways, as evidenced by this album.  Average production.  Uninspired, generic rhyming schemes and also-ran content.  The production and engineering are fuzzy and lo-fi - and it's not on purpose.  An amateur job all around.  It would be nice if this was cut to 4 songs and labeled a demo tape.  There's definitely growing pains all throughout.  Skip to his later selection 
 When I started reading this book, I was reminded of the excellent Silverberg's little novel "The World inside". However, a few more pages into Oath of Fealty and I had a shallow, epidermic, cardboard story that reads like a tv mini series. Stay away at all costs 
 I have mixed feelings about this quasi-romance novel about an American teacher named Hope and Po-yu (Paul), her Chinese student. On one hand, it was often very interesting, as Ms. Liu gives a lot of historical detail about San Francisco and China. On the other hand, the characters were rather shallow. I didn't find Hope, who oddly resembled a whiny yuppie of the present day, particularly appealing. Po-yu was far more interesting, and was portrayed with some complexity and depth. The romance between Hope and Po-yu rang false for me. ("Honey, I first fell in love with you when I realized it was required for the plot to progress!") I still can't see what attracted them to each other. Also, did anyone else notice that any slight against Hope is recorded with meticulous detail (the rampant racism against Chinese at that time seems glossed over in comparison although it is mentioned), but Ms. Liu has some pretty crude stereotypes in this novel: a hearty blonde Swede, a drunk, surly Irishwoman, and Hope's one-sided-ly disagreeable mother-in-law to name a few. Also, she takes some pretty cheap shots at two groups it is still politically correct to demonize: all the Britons in the book are "right-o, jolly-good" bigots, and all the Christians are consistently hypocritical, or stupid, or both. In addition, much of the middle of the book is bogged down in political discussions that try so hard to be interesting that they're just the opposite. And to top it all off, the ending was forced. This novel could have been so much better: as this book is based on the lives of her grandparents, she obviously had some fascinating material to work with. And one more quibble: one of Hope and Po-yu's daughters is named Jennifer Pearl. In 1908 the name Jennifer pretty much existed in only one place in the world: Cornwall, UK 
 Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging.  I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection.  To each their own but it is not something I would recommend 
 This book was advertised as NEW but when it arrived, it had several pages missing and numerous paragraphs clipped out of other pages.  NOT GOOD 
 "The End of Democracy" (2003) is the best answer to this theory 
 This publication features vague descriptions of photo concepts that makes it useless for reference.  Possibly good for beginners, but if you are even an amateur photographer, you need a book that describes more in depth about filters, push processing, lenses, and chemicals. I was slightly disappointed and am still looking for a good reference book. For now, I am just googling concepts that I am  trying to research. Works better than this book 
 Few leftist icons are looked upon more favorably than professor and activist Howard Zinn. Like many radical ideologues, he is the darling of students, the professorate, and the glitterati. Indeed, Hollywood star Matt Damon provided the narration for a hagiographic documentary about his life entitled, Howard Zinn -You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train.  "You can't be neutral" is a reference to Zinn's belief that all history is skewed by the mind that conveys it, and that the best historians must be "engaged" in political and societal matters. Therefore, it is non-remarkable when their discussion of events always manages to be harmonious with their worldview. Such a post-modernist outlook is quite popular today, but prevalence is not always an indication of value. Zinn informs viewers that no work is ever completely objective, which then allows him (and other activists) to avoid using research and citations which do not substantiate their pre-determined suppositions.   That no historical account is ever 100 percent objective cannot be doubted, but an automaton's level of clinical impartiality is neither possible nor expected. One commits a black-or-white fallacy by pretending that it is as nothing can ever be 100 percent objective or subjective. Good history doggedly attempts to be unbiased. When it abandons its detachment, any amount of distortion becomes acceptable; history gets alchemized into propaganda. Zinn minimizes his own lack of scholarship in The Peoples' History of the United States by claiming that it was not written with an academic audience in mind.   As a man, Zinn appears to be more celebrity than egghead. He isn't one to quibble over the nature of secondary or primary source materials, he'd rather illustrate his points by quoting lyrics from a Woody Guthrie song. No doubt that the directors of this film ascribe to their subject's view of fairness as not one of the individuals interviewed uttered a single negative syllable about Zinn. Uniformly leftist luminaries like Noam Chomsky, Alice Walker, Marian Wright Edelman, Daniel Ellsberg, and Tom Hayden spent their segments exalting the importance of his impact upon society.   Their depiction of Zinn's personality was most revealing and in keeping with the tendencies of leftists in general. According to his friends and associates, he possesses a "steely anger," and "an endless capacity for moral outrage" which is representative of the whole. Dr. John Ray's key psychological components of the leftist are discernible in Zinn as his need for fame, praise, power, and attention are quite pronounced.   At one point, Zinn's perceptions appear utterly astonishing. As a Jew in the Air Force who was sent to fight the Nazis during World War II, he found himself in a position of, what should have been, absolute moral clarity. If ever a person was placed into a position where war was morally just, this was it. However, his reminiscences are confined to indignation over his unit's bombing an enclave of German soldiers. He lamented the action as the men in the French village, "weren't doing anything to anybody"--except defending the boundaries of a genocide state.    Perhaps the best way to sum up Howard Zinn is through words he applied to Uncle Sam: "limited, opinionated and with special interests." 
 Please don't waste your money on this book, especially if you have little prior knowledge regarding linear regression. It is poorly written and seldom gives proper explanations for the various aspects of regression analysis. Weisberg wrote it keeping brevity in mind, so don't expect to find many details; this book is definitely not for beginners, and even people I know with more experience have noted that it is often difficult to understand. 
 The book is long-winded and filled with copious padding stuff. The authors seem forgot the basic design principle. It is extremely annoying to read the same material again and again on the same page and in different chapters, especially when the material covered is already common sense in nature 
 I love David Cross's comedy,  I love his stand up, I love Mr. Show. But this dvd is not kinda boring, it is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  There may be a few folks who find something entertaining in this dvd -- there is no accounting for taste. But 98 out of 100 normal people will simply shake their heads trying to figure out why this dvd was released 
 I was a fan of Tom Browne during the early eighties, his heyday, and found many of his recordings in line with much of the jazz fusion of that time.  When purchasing this CD, I mistakenly thought that it was the original "Funkin for Jamaica" album which was a good album, instead of a compilation.  The tracks chosen for this CD lean heavily on the pop-jazz end, and fails to demonstrate any of Mr. Browne's acumen on the trumpet.  Except for "Funkin for Jamaica" and one other track, this CD is very forgetful. 
 I found this book quite unsatisfactory. The main focus is always on the Western Front (shockingly leaving out the Americans and their indispensable human and logistical support). The Eastern and Italian fronts are almost completely left out. The Author seem to ignore that millions of soldiers fought and died far from the Marne and the Somne (being Italian myself, I would like to remind the Author that the Italians had 600,000 dead and millions of wounded in the Great War). The sacrifice of Russian and Italian soldiers kept hundreds of German and Austrian divisions far from the Western front and the British troops. And what about the big blounder of the Peace of Versailles? Is still too embarassing for Mr Keegan to talk about it?  
 Every summer brought the drive in my in-laws' car from Stockton to Santa Cruz. I was not a California native,only marrying into a California family so I was not familiar with the state's history.I just remember California seeming so vivid and alive.  Joan Didion narrates her family's move west and the intertwined history of the state and her family. Not only do we learn of family, but of the changes in the society. California has always struck me as a restless  state, ever on the move, turning to the next idea or trend. Didion follows her family's history, the eventual erosion of the ties to the land and agriculture and the huge immigrant wave. There are the huge industrial closedowns and the urban sprawl and growth. This is a book for anyone who loves California, but not nearly as revealing about the author nor her roots.  
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 Lacks any gripping force and it is an effort to work thru i 
 Not that the author has not been scholastically thorough in his presentation of what he deems "facts", but there is with this book more than meets the eye.  As a Philadelphian and as a member of The Nation of Islam, I know and grew up observing many of Mr. Griffin's principal subjects and, quite frankly, it isn't as simple as he makes it seem.    Yes, there was corruption and crime in Black Philadelphia in the 1970's, and some of it was clearly the work of those who dubiously identified themselves as Nation members.  However, to use the terms "Black Muslims" (Nation of Islam) and "Black Mafia" interchangably would be a gross error for too many reasons to cite in this space.  Suffice it to say that some of the men that Mr. Griffin would paint with the broad brush of suspicion have been either penitant for their crimes, vindicated by the legacy of their extraordinary children, or both...  In short, this treatise and its oddly coincidental release date (concurrent with the widely reported trial of a Muslim cleric in Philadelphia) could also stand to come under some "investigation". Wise readers will take all of the above and more into account when reading this, all the while remembering that the "Black Mafia" is no more, but the glorious history of Islam in Black Philadelphia continues to flourish today, in spite of the best efforts of its detractors 
 While this book is generally on with its observations of general human behavior, it should in the relationship section, not psychology. Its pop-psych style of unsubstantiated examples doesn't provide much valuable  information for you to learn from. It's an entertaining read, but when all  is said and done, it's difficult for a reader with any knowledge of the  MBTI to feel like they've learned anything worthwhile. If you want a book  about relationship quirks, this is the one. Otherwise, look for something  else 
 I picked up this book expecting an easy yet interesting read...but what i found was an incredibly dry plot scattered with beaten down stereotypes and silly characters fitting perfectly into the mould of their respective roles. I haven't read her debut novel, a Breath of Fresh Air yet, but now that i'm done with this book, i'm wondering if it will be an unfortunate waste of time. 
 Republicans lose an election, and what do they do? They go right back to the stupid practices that got them kicked  out of office.  Yes, Republicans have gone back to talking about God, taking the moral high ground against the "secular, evil left." Never mind illegal immigration, the trade policies which forfeit our national sovereignty.  Never mind America's loss of credibility and allies in the world.   My Republican party has abondoned its core principles espoused by Barry Goldwater, which focused on a smaller role for government,   national sovereignty, and fiscal responsibility.  Speaking as a Republican, it looks like my party is bound  and determined to stay the minority party forever, and to become a willing accompliss in putting Hillary in the White House. . 
 First I want to state all the good things about this book - because they are certainly the principles of this book.  Dr. Andrew Weil's Eating Well for Optimum Health holds a wealth of information. Starting with the chemistry of how your body handles food and then explaining how that affects the goods and bads of what's out there is the basis in which Weil promotes his theories. In a world where foods become vilified and championed alike through various 'studies'... it can be intimidating to know what you should include in an 'optimum diet'. Weil clears a lot of this up and is pretty specific about what vitamins, minerals, whole foods and nutrients we should be nourishing our body with. All in all this is a great book on the science of food.  Now, for the bad part. I actually finished this book over a weekend, sick in bed, about a month ago. I was 'sick of being sick' as some would say and devoured (pardon the pun) this wealth of knowledge. After I was well enough to get back to my routine, I threw away almost every single food item in my kitchen, as almost nothing adhered to the optimum plan. I was still very motivated with my bare cupboards and then set out to turn my family's life around.   Dr. Weil makes it pretty clear that you are going to pretty much have to go exclusively organic, bar a few, and I mean few, fruits and vegetables. He even states that some non-organic fruits and vegetables are so toxic in their non-organic state you should never consume them - strawberries for example. Something Weil will also state is the pesca-ovo-vegetarianism diet is his diet of choice, because almost all meats are riddled with hormones that greatly impact our own bodies. The optimum food pyramid doesn't really include animal proteins, so if you aren't a vegetarian, you'll have some serious issues to resolve.  He tells you he loves food, and feels anyone who misses the point and stops enjoying food is wasting their time. I totally agree, but in practice, this book does just about that. Demonizing foods based on the fears of cancer and inflammatory disease can be a difficult pill to swallow, particularly if you've consumed these foods all of your life. The nature of label reading and being a smart consumer can literally drive you insane. It's certainly beneficial, we know that, but making it a lifestyle will require more then just a bit of education.  This book also is not for anyone seeking weight-loss through diet modification. Weil explains it certainly can be done, but he spends more time telling you what diets, such as Atkins, not to partake in. This fact is actually not a negative side to the book. However given the nations statistics on obesity I think this could have been a more helpful aspect of the book if he developed it.  I will end with this: This book could/would be an incredible useful tool if you were any or (ideally all) of the following:  1. You are wealthy. Try buying exclusively organic. It's outrageous. Most working families can not afford this lifestyle, contrary to the notion that prepared and processed foods are expensive. Prepared and process foods are cheap - that's why Americans consume them at such high rates. He suggest to organic co-op farms, but even as late as 2006 they can be scarce for most people in the suburbs, and when you do find them, they will only be cheaper then buying organic from natural food stores and chains, which isn't saying much. Don't be shocked when you find vine-ripened organic tomatoes at $5.99 a pound.  2. You do not work. Almost exclusively cooking from scratch, which is even acknowledged by Weil, will be the hardest transition for anyone who works full-time or has a family. This is probably the saddest aspect of this book. There certainly is nothing wrong with from cooking wholesome, healthy meals from scratch - but it isn't the norm for most people. If you buy the foods recommended, you'll be spending about 70% of your day in the kitchen if preparing 3 meals.   3. You already lead a healthful and active lifestyle. If this is you then you probably already knew much of Weil's intuitive advice and therefore will need only tweaking to adhere to the optimum plan.  My personal experience with this book is that you can back yourself into a corner with fear. If you work and have a family I suggest you skip this book. Working in your 5+ a day fruits and vegetables, organic or not, and leading an active lifestyle is a good place to start. The Eating For Optimum Health book creates a pretty black and white picture. And we all know life isn't black and white.   
 Admittedly I wasn't reading this book for pleasure, as I had to read it for a class, but it is very poor indeed.  Okay, I'm not a PhD historian like Bennett, but that shouldn't mean my criticism is invalid.  The book is an interesting concept, trying find out what a peasant's life was like, but is just FULL of "perhaps she did this..." and "maybe she did that..."  Bennett, in reality, is writing a book about the medieval peasantry, trying to make it interesting and accessible to college students by making the book revolve around a character.  However, the book proves condescending, and left me very frustrated as a slammed the book shut on the final page.  Here are a few examples:  "I felt as if Cecilia was demanding...that I write her life" p. 138  And regarding the 'doodle' in the court records: "If Cecilia is the woman shown in this drawing, we can surmise that she was tall, thin, curly-headed, and perhaps the bearer of a prominent nose" p. 130  As with many other textbooks for college, this was too expensive for only 138 pages, and should be the $10 it is in the Marketplace, not the $30 that my bookstore was charging.  The unfortunate truth is that it will be very difficult to ever know what life was like for the average medieval peasant since they did not write anything, and Bennett's account seems to add no real value to this subject area, and the 'story' of Cecilia Penifader could have easily been summarized on a page or two 
 i bought this screen and hoped it would keep the stove top clean whilst i sauteed or fried food.  i used it twice and it worked well. the third time i placed it on top of my cast iron skillet where the hamburgers were grilling and the screen caught fire at the edge.  it was a small fire but big enough to burn a hole thru the screen and i no longer want to use it and take a chance of another fire.  think twice before buying thi 
 I have read all of Sandra Brown books. I was disappointed in this one. I have almost all of her books in my bookcase, but when I finished this one I gave it away.  
 The author shows she is obviously making a transition from poetry to prose with this novel.  Her sentences are long and wordy, and her numerous metaphors make little sense in their context.  She goes to great lengths to describe many little and unimportant details, causing the actual story to suffer from lack of content.  Her descriptions of life in general seem unreal - she describes things and events in a way that no person would do in the circumstance.  The storyline is decent in some places, but it is generally hard for the reader to follow.  Many times, I had to go back to read paragraphs and pages again to realize where the author was going.  It is true there were many points in which I wanted to stop reading all together, which is a rarity.  I was altogether disappointed in the book.  I thought it would be decent, from all the literary awards it had won, but it really was just pages of fluff and poetry disguised as prose 
 By page 167 I said, "Enough already!"  Where were the twists I love so much in Deaver's books?  It was BORING!!  Don't waste your time.  I couldn't finish it 
 I didn't like this book at all.  I couldn't even finish it.  It was too complicated and too many underlying characters 
 I am a student currently using this book for a course. I have found this book to be, quite literally, the worst textbook I have encountered. Neither author is a native English speaker and this is quite apparent (especially in the way questions at the end of the chapter are phrased). I can read a question and have no idea what the authors are asking me to find (this isn't a matter of not knowing how). To begin most problems, I have to look at the solutions manual to figure out what it is the authors intended to ask me. If you are a professor considering this book, please, please, please think of your students and find a textbook that is easier to understand!  A few other notes: 1. Questions refer to figures, tables and samples are sprinkled throughout the chaper without giving a page number. I have seen other books that give a page number - this is much more friendly. 2. The notation used in the book is not explained and explanations seem to miss critical steps or concepts 
 Talk to the Polish and South Koreans, and ask them why they do more with less.   
 The only play Shakespeare wrote that I did not like at all was "Othello." "All's Well That Ends Well" was never that popular. It lacks the hilarious tone of "The Comedy of Errors,"  the superb construction of "Much Ado About Nothing," or the  profound messages of "The Merchant of Venice."  Also, we can very  well be in two minds of what to think of Bertram's rejection of Helena. The  characters are not that convincing, and much of the humour is based on bad  taste. But the play is not quite a flop. There are moments of suspense.  There is some delightful comedy (especially when Bertram chooses to stay in  battle rather than go home and marry Helena). And at times, Helena is  memorable. I would not make time to read this play, but then it's not a  waste of time either 
 This movie was hyped-up to be something almost cult-like and very funny.  I found it flat and painfully slow.  The acting and story-line was very lacking.  Some scenery was very pretty, but overall, one was just waiting for something interesting to happen, but it never did.  One big *thud* 
 Frankly, I found this deeply disappointing.  I read a few of Delany's books a few years ago and liked them for their full-on romanticism, their vision and enthusiasm.  But these essays are fundamentally dull.  Maybe it's their subjects.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but Dr Dryasdust and his colleagues.  How did this fine Romantic become such a dreary academic  
 I didnt think the book was bad until the further I got.  I could understand why Rose decided to leave California.  I was glad that she decided to keep the baby.  Even when she married Son I thought for sure that she would finally grow to love someone, including her daughter.  The fact that she remained so flat and uncaring really bothered me.  I would have loved to see Thomas show up with no warning and finally see all the truth come out and see some resolution for all the caracters that Rose touched.  I almost felt that Patchett lost her steam, and found it easier to let Rose disappear and end the book than to deal with what was really happening.  At the very least, I would have liked an explanation from Rose at the end as to why once a again she couldnt stay and deal.  As far as being a Saint, I didnt see any redeeming quality about Rose for that kind of title.  It was frustrating and disappointing.  Its the kind of book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth 
 The overall steel frame and structure of it is good, but there are too many flaws with this product, I recommend going with something else.    Flaws:   1) Bands do not give you good increments of resistence.  If you want even resistance on each side, you go from 20 lbs to 40lbs in one setting, which is crazy.    2) Workout and Assembly manuals are terrible.  Especially the Workout manual - what use is a machine if the correct use of it is not demonstrated?  What does that really say about how much Stamina cares about people using it correctly, without injury, and getting good benefit out of it?  Only about 10 exercises are really shown, the rest are just single pictures that let's you vaguely guess at what you are supposed to do, except that many are for some other machine, not this one. I'm sure someone will get injured from incorrect use.    3) Many of the pictures are misleading, such that you can't actually do many of the exercises suggested or inferred by the pictures.  One customer service person told me the pictures were of some prototype machine.  Ridiculous.   4) Several construction pieces I received were bad and caused problems, but replacement parts were shipped with no problem, albeit it meant waiting a week or so for each one, and then time to reconstruct the machine.  I had to replace the main Rail and a main leg support frame piece because they were both welded wrong.    5) Leg padding is inadequate and painful  6) Doesn't seem to be a product that is understood or cared about by Stamina, no one I called seems to use it or really can tell you about it.  For a company that claims to care about health and fitness, they really don't show it with this product or support for this product.  I'd go elsewhere.  
 In book two of the Kathy Reichs series involving Temperance Brennan, Tempe finds herself with dead bodies on two continents.  Upon examination, she begins to find unusual similarities that link these deaths.  But how can the victims be so far apart and yet somehow be related?  What evil force is at work here and who can stop it?  And how is a nun's missing niece tied to the destruction?  To top it all off, her eccentric sister from Texas has gone missing in Canada in her quest to "find herself."  Tempe must deal with whether some evil has touched her sister or whether this is just another installment of her sister's flaky personality.  The murders in this book follow Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas in too far fetched a pattern.  Wherever this woman travels, bodies pop up that no one but her can possibly deal with.  As an anthropologist it is logical that she would find herself dealing with skeletal remains, but it is completely unbelievable to find that as she travels between her two homes that the bodies keep piling up and no one else is available to conduct the investigation.  Again Tempe is a heroine that is difficult to like.  When asked to assist with the deaths she whines internally about how she had other plans and really doesn't want to be bothered.  When she finally relents, she has trouble associating the clues that she sees.  There are terrible lines illustrating this such as "that kindled something...in my memory cells, but when I tried to bring it up the spark went out."  Another: "The mental itch was back.  What was it?  Why couldn't I bring it to the surface?"  Yet 100 pages later she is magically pulling it all together and making extrodinary leaps and bounds toward solving the crimes of the century.  This is my second attempt at Kathy Reichs.  I already own the next two books in the series, so I will read them eventually, but it seems as though this set of novels is a huge disappointment with ridiculous plots and an unlikable heroine 
 The Stephen Mitchell version of the Tao Te Ching will please the philosophical bent and Weltanschauung of certain modern and post-modern readers. On points it is extremely Spinozan. To recognize that many readers will like it, perhaps like it a great deal, is not to suggest that it is an 'authentic' translation, because it is not. To Mitchell's credit, he acknowledges this (after a fashion, at least). He thinks he is relating what Lao Tzu really meant to say to 20th century readers. Certain 21st century western readers may agree with Mitchell, but I expect that most scholars will not.  The prospective reader should be aware that this is the Way of Stephen Mitchell, which, at least on some points, is not the Way of the "ancient masters." I strongly suggest that this NOT be the first or the only 'version' of the Tao Te Ching that you read. In fact, [assuming that you prefer not to be misled] I suggest that you don't read it at all. The [authentic] Tao Te Ching is a fascinating text, counter-intuitive and challenging, worthy of our contemplation and puzzlement thousands of years after its writing. This volume isn't. 
 Although providing nice code examples and clearly explaining the mathemantics of standard computer graphics algorithms, its ~270 (paperback) pages do not cover the scope or detail of the ~1100 (hardcover) pages in "Computer Graphics" by Foley, van Damm, et al., which costs roughly the same amount. John Wiley & Sons needs to be brought to task on the pricing issue, as the high price really shadows the real value (and business opportinity) of the book. My conspiracy theory is that the publisher is aiming to market it as a text book where students can't counter being ripped off by a publisher endorced by a professor or university 
 Stale, painfully obvious information from the so-called internet gurus. Full of "what-to-do" instead of the more useful "how-to-do" information. If you really must get this type of info, go to the authors' websites. It's just get rich on the internet by telling others how to get rich on the internet. For beginners in ecommerce, there's very little in the way of detailed step-by-step instructions. For people with more experience, there's nothing new here, just a compilation of articles with the author's website address at the end of each one where you can actually buy the information they're telling you about 
 I read this book a while back and decided that I finally had the time to write about it now. This was one of the slowest moving books i have ever read. T he plot was decent but te author spent a good 10 pages elaborating on every detail of Bobby's life and his rise to fame. After a while it just became unbearable and I had to stop. If you have a hig patience novel and like reading roundabout novels then this one is made jst for you 
 Being asian myself I am highly insulted by this book! To think there is some mystical book that tells people how they date asians is totaly foolish. Guys, asians are girls just like any other girls and they like the same things. Instead of throwing away your money on this cowpie of a book, buy the girl some flowers. They will go a lot further at winning her heart than anything you will learn from this book 
 "The Passing of The Great Race" was one of the racialist books written between 1855 and 1920 that would strongly influence the the National Socialist Party. The first was Gobineau's "The Inequality of The Human Races", the second was Houston Stewart Chamberlain's "The Foundations of The Nineteenth Century", the third was this one, and the fourth was Lothrop Stoddard's "The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy". Grant was a lawyer and conservationist who was a firm beleiver in the Old Order, free of Bolshevism and Socialism and centered around an Anglo-Saxon culture. Grant always tried to portray himself as more scientific than romantic racial theorists such as Chamberlain, but his theories actually have little scientific basis. For example, his division of Whites into Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean Races is anchored only on the basis of Nordic Scnadinavians having blonde hair, Alpine Slavs having brown hair, and Mediterranean Italians having black hair. Even worse is Grant's lack of historical basis. He considers the French, Southern Germans, and Poles to be a mix of Teutonic or Celtic Nordic peoples and dark-haired Alpine peoples who invaded Europe from Asia, but there was never any record of Asiatic peoples reaching France or Germany, at least not after the Celtic period. His classifications of Alpine are also very flimsy. He considers Southern Germans to be of Alpine stock, completely ignoring the fact that Southern Germans speak a Teutonic language and often have Teutonic features such as blonde hair and blue eyes. He also considers the Walloons of Belgium to be Alpine, ignoring the fact that they are descendants of the Celtic Belgae, who the Romans clearly described as being tall with blonde and red hair {sounds Nordic to me}. He also claims that the Irish and Welsh have substantial amounts of Mediterranean blood, ignoring the fact that both those peoples are Celtic and often have blonde or red hair. The most puzziling part of this whole thing is how this book became so popular when practicaly everyone is labled as inferior. Grant considers the only pure Nordics to be people with blonde hair and blue eyes, so why did people like Teddy Roosevelt {brunett} endorse it? Grant's book just lacks any spirit. I've read Chamberlain's "Foundations of The Nineteenth Century", and anyone who is of Celtic, Teutonic, or Slavic stock and is anti-Semitic will be riled up with the romaticism of the "Germanic" race being in constant battle with the Jews for survival. Anyone who has Celtic, Scandinavian, German, Anglo-Saxon, Polish, or Baltic ancestry is included in this Germanic race, while Grant tends to alienate anyone who isn't a blonde, blue-eyed Anglo-Saxon or Swede, even putting the Germans down as inferior. This book should also be compared to Stoddard's "The Rising Tide of Color", which was written four years later. Stoddard also went by the Nordic-Alpine-Mediterranean model, but focused less on this than on the White Race as a whole. Stoddard was a visionary, looking to White issue in the future. While Grant clamored about keeping non-Nordic Russians and Italians out of the country, Stoddard warned that the real dangers are non-White Asians and Negroes. Grant's book has little relevance to today's issues, as practically every White American is a German-Irish-Polish-Italian mix. Stoddard, however, saw that all Whites had to band together against the "rising tide of color".                      
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 As a PIC beginner I was hoping for more than this book provides in the first few chapters.    As already pointed out the title is very misleading; there certainly aren't 123 "experiments".  Many of the 123 articles are to do with the ins and outs of programming in C.    The typos and other mistakes don't help either and don't fill you with confidence when what you do doesn't reflect what the book says will happen, e.g. experiment 7, p31 where the LEDs I get aren't the same as indicated, and looking at the circuit, you'd never get the LEDs lit as indicated in the book.  Sloppy.  
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
  What a wonderful criticism of American foreign policy. I was under the impression that "Storm From The East" would be an overview of almost  1400 of the  Middle Eastern region's history  and conflicts with the Christian world. However as soon as you begin reading , it is ever so clear that this is not the case. The entire book is almost exclusively focused on  how horrible the American and Imperial powers have ruined and tarnished the Arab world. If a reader is hoping to gather facts and draw their own conclusions on how current affairs should be resolved then defiantly do NOT waste your time reading this book.  Just look at the author, Milton Viorst who writes for the New York Times, Washington Post, etc..  How could anyone think he couldn't be bias of the current administration`s foreign policy in the Middle East? The core message of his entire book is it was wrong to go to war in Iraq and President Bush  is fueling more and more hate of Westerners by the Arab world.   Take for instance the first sentence of the first chapter: "America's war in Iraq, from its start, did not go as President Bush's administration had predicted".  It continues as you can tell by the last sentence of the Epilogue: "The alternative would be that history, taking note of the inexhaustible antagonism between Arab civilization and the West, remembers the Bush administration for pouring fuel upon the struggle.". From this you can draw your own conclusions as to what is in between them.  What Bostonian wouldn't like it? 
 I have spent a ton of money learning from the best marketers regarded in the world. This book is laughable in my humble opinion 
 You can get a 4 pack of Emerging Power 2100 mAH batteries for 9.95 on this very site.   I did.  They work great.  Why would anyone pay almost 30 bucks just for the batteries.  Ridiculous 
 I listened to this book on tape. I must have listened to the first tape 4  times. Be prepared, unless you are a psychologist yourself or in the field,  to pause and look up words in the dictionary. There are no explanations in  the text. I even had a hard time finding some of the terms on the internet  dictionary and had to resort to serching the web for any info. All in all I  felt I could have gotten so much more out of it had he used simpler terms 
 This Movie takes a big flaming tird on the MK series I mean How could Ed Boon let them do this. This Movie suck's dont ever watch it. It has Power ranger fighting and the cast stinks. The First one is the best 
 The book Teacup Full Of Roses had a few topics that teens today could relate to. Nevertheless, this was not a very enjoyable book to me . I didn't like it because of how short it was. I think it should have been longer to give more details. In my opinion, the prolouge didn't fit well with the ending of the book. Overall, I give the book a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. I would not reccomend this book to anyone because it was lacking a few things, which made it confusing 
 Robert Fried has designed a how-to book that articulates what passion in education is.  This topic has been lost in a black hole somewhere because  most often teachers are so busy that they do not have time to reflect on  what worked and what did not work in their lesson plans. 	The  Passionate Teacher demonstrates that we need to be more than just  passionate about our field of study - we need to build a "stance" about  students and learning.  Fried clearly illustrates that the quality of a  teacher's believing and behaving - what he calls "stance" - is what makes  passionate teaching possible.   Often times we find that the fear of  humiliation keeps students from sharing their most innovative,  controversial ideas, resulting in a lack of energy and enthusiasm in the  classroom.  Throughout this book, Fried offers real life personal stories  and ideas about how he and other teachers have put their passions to work.   After reading this book, one can picture the effects of passion in the  classroom.   	Fried reminds us that what we think is important for  students to learn in order to be successful in life, may not always be what  our students will feel they need.  He urges educators to build on knowledge  that students already have and to start bringing their interests into the  classroom. 	In the The Passionate Teacher, Fried explores the question,  "Where do teachers hit the wall in their struggle to become or remain  enthusiastic about their profession?"  He offers strategies for getting out  of the "game" and onto something better.  To change the "game" teachers  need to start seriously listening to their students and find out what is  getting in the way of the kind of learning that they, like all of us, are  naturally supposed to seek out and respond to.    	Fried also stresses  the idea of having fun in the classroom.  Why wouldn't this make sense?   Most of a child's learning comes from play.  Teachers need to take a step  back and look at what they are doing - what they are teaching and ask  themselves what do they want their students to remember a year from now.   	 This is a book I am confident I will have by my side throughout my teaching  career. Fried's ideas are so inspiring. I have already begun implementing  his ideas and strategies into my planning.   I believe all teachers have  some element of passion for teaching, even though it may be lost.  Fried  teaches us how to put this passion to work and how to bring passion back  into our classrooms 
 the story from "After dark" gets a second wind. Now Emmet has to act as guild boss and Lydia manages to "save" him from peril by marrying him. The same idiotic problems of a love affair spiced with two-three rather boring sex scenes, the worst use of an alien enviroment ever to be found in a book. Still, a beautiful cover. Too bad, again. Not recommended 
 We recently bought the same model dispenser, but in the satin finish.  From the first, only two of the three chambers were usable because the pumps didn't work (yes, we followed the instructions carefully).  Two months later, another pump has given out so only one chamber is usable.  Instead of this loser, try "The Dispenser 71450 Classic IV." We had one of these for years with never a problem and replaced it only because it was beginning to show its age. It's harder to fill than the AVIVA and not as pretty, but so what -- it works, and the AVIVA doesn't.  
 I bought two of the Mia computer games for my emotionally disturbed special ed. class. I bought it specifically for one little guy who has been in crisis since his grandmother (caregiver) passed away. The storyline of the game is that Mia has to SAVE her gravely ill grandmother. Then she gets MUGGED by a rat! I feel this is a little to noir for small children. The math game (which I am returning unopened) is about her house burning down, and if she could prevent it by going back through time. I feel like this puts a whole world of responsibility on young subjects. I am returning both games 
 This is a seventy-five page book. A lot of it's pages are only half filled  with text, which makes the book maybe only forty pages. You might as well  call it a small guide. Most of the chapters are only one page long. That  should tell you a lot about this worthless book. It tells you absolutely  nothing on what you need to know from a young woman. NOTHING! Save your  money! It took me less than an hour to read this thing, and I quickly  returned this so-called book. Don't be swayed by positive comments on this,  because it will probably be the authors friends 
 I was so disappointed in this book. I found it very hard to believe that Jonathan Kellerman actually wrote this book. I found it downright corny the way Alex Delaware was playing ace detective and kept just happening to be at the right place at the right time. The book seemed to have no "story" to it, as his always do. I got very bored reading one and a half pages of descriptions of what people were wearing, how their hair looked and on and on. I always enjoyed Kellerman's breif descriptions of people and places, but once again, this became downright corny.  I'm glad this was not my first Kellerman book, as I probably wouldn't try another one. I'm a dedicated reader of his and hope that this was just a fluke. Everyone's entitled to one bad book. Hope that was his first and last 
 My family grew up in South Texas, and it's a good thing or the cookbook would not be very helpful.  The recipes are what you would expect from South Texas, however the details needed to prepare these authentic recipes are simply not to be found in this cookbook.  I also have the Tex-Mex Cookbook, and the San Antonio Tex Mex Cookbook, and both offer well written recipes which you can duplicate.  I would only recomend this cookbook for nostalgic reasons, a much better choice would be the tex-Mex Cookbook, both historically and for the recipes. 
 I am glad to know it wasn't just me. I was really disappointed by this book. I have tried to read everyone of Cornwell's books and picked this one up based on past experience. It does not even come close to her usual skills. It may be that it was written for serialization in a magazine. It should not have been allowed out as a book. Her publishers did not do her a favor by letting this go out to the public. It is possible that Win and Sykes could become interesting characters in a well developed book; they were interesting in this book and I liked the setting in Cambridge, but it wasn't enough 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 I am a retired teacher and work part-time in a school library.  I read the Newberry Winners each year.  For the second year in a row, I am disappointed in the choice!  Last year's "Kira-Kira" was a disappointment as is this year's "Criss-Cross." I'm not certain of the standards by which the books are chosen.  "Criss-Cross" remains a mystery to me because I see no outstanding literary value in the writing or the story itself.  
 For what purpose these lies about the life of this man? Are the liberal film makers racists who don't believe that there is a good black man to depict on film so they have to lie? If someone wanted to write fiction about a badass black fighter on the cusp of super stardom who is framed for a murder then be my guest. Hurricane carter is not and was not that man.  Facts: In the movie denzel washington is shown in military garb with more medals on his cheat than colin powell. They want to drive home the point that here was a man who served his country and is now about to be screwed by it. Fact is carter was kicked out of the army after being court mashalled 4 times!  In a title fight scence with an italian american fighter named giodello carter is depictied as beating this man pillar to post only to be screwed out of the decision he so richly deserved. Fact, giardello deserved to win that fight according to the overwhelming number of experts who have viewed it then and now on tape. The depitction is another lie.  Another lie is this notion put forth in the movie that hurricane was on the verge of getting that title before mean white bigots framed him for this murder. Fact is that carter's boxing career was going down hill and he had only won 8 of his last 15 fights. As carter's boxing career failed he became more militant in his political views and hated white people. While in prison he was diagnosed to be psychotic. Yeah a psychotic racist is the model for black america. Shame.  Norman jewison must not think much of black folks to make a movie of lies like this. Denzel washington should be ashamed he participated in such trash. Those who produced this trash bet that the average public would be gullible enough to believe these lies with no attempt at knowing the truth and hollywood didn't care; they just like the message. Looking at these reviews i have to say they made a good bet. America bashing and race baiting is alive and well, earning oscars and making for big box office. A shame.       
 Unless you have been schooled on the fundamentals of Buddhist teachings (which I have not), this book will be way too complicated to be very useful in your life. It simply does not offer the kinds of practical insights that people need in order to change their attitudes and behaviors. The language is obtuse, evasive, just plain difficult to understand for the average college graduate with no background in psychology or religious theory. What a shame. It seems like Ms. Chodron is well qualified to really help people become more comfortable with uncertainty, if she would only write in a language more of us could understand. 
 Bigoted and racist title for a book about talented blacks, their deserving of a more honorable title since they were called these racist nicknames all their lives and had to be these stereotypes to show their talent, but he can get away with naming a book as he has this one because he's Black, I'm sure if a white did the same, the NAACP will jump on him. Bogle suppose to lift Blacks up not put them down.  Here's a long but informative review! Naturally since Bogle is the only one writing about early Black film stars people believe everything he says. He plays it safe by always talking about the same ole' stars that he talked about in his last books. Never does he introduce the public to unsung talents we never heard of. He spends most of the time talking about how mulatto, how light or how dark such and such is and how such and such couldn't do this or that because of this or that. When whites write on their stars they don't write about how blonde, how brunette or how red head someone was and how Irish or Italian one looked. Which proves how stuck on skin color Blacks really are! Why do Blacks feel they always have to spend time talking about race instead of giving these stars their recognition and due, forgetting how they look and telling of their life and versatile careers, who they really were, where they come from, making one reading feel like they knew the person all their lives, make one feel the happiness and sadness. Bogle spends more time on what they didn't do then what they did do. Which is sad, the public is missing out on a lot. So again, do for yourself the research and don't' depend on others all the time.  Bogle loves talking about how white Fredi Washington looked instead of writing about her extensive, incredible career, she done more in her life then most of us could dream about it, she didn't let others prejudices hold her back. She was no tragic mulatto, another stupid name, minus well call Stepin Fetchit a tragic ni**er which he wasn't, he was the first black millionaire and no more of a stereotype then Black pimps, gangsters of today who are getting rich off of it like Step got rich off of his stereotype. Fredi will be the first to say she had a great life and career. She wasn't sad or confused but a strong black woman. Bogle is no better than a white writer who puts down a black but thinks its okay to coin a book Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks because he's black, I'm sure if a white titled a book that we be yelling racism, don't Black talents deserve a better title?   Bogle also plays it safe by always talking about Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, never telling the stories and never giving recognition to other black actresses like Nina Mae McKinney, Mildred Washington, Theresa Harris, Fredi Washington, Edna Mae Harris, Florence O'Brien, Louise Franklin, Daisy Bufford, Jeni LeGon Evelyn Preer, Suzette Harbin, Hilda Simms, Francine Everett, Shirley Haven and countless of others who had a chance to display their talents on the screen in Hollywood and helped fight discrimination and  help in the enhancement and betterment of blacks on screen but he gives all the credit to Horne and Dandridge, who didn't do as much as others if you want to get down to the truth, but I'm glad he don't talk about them in a way because he'll butcher up their life stories, I'll give them their due though. Many aren't remembered because maybe they didn't do as much, who cares about who has done more, were suppose to be remembering them for accomplishments and talents, right? White film historians sure remember all their stars, little or big. Someone like Louise Brooks, considered a early Hollywood icon is highly regarded as a great actress despite she only had a few good films and wasnt a big movie star. The woman is more remembered for one good film and a bobbed hairstyle but white historians will make sure you know her, her achievements and what she DID DO for the film industry.  Why can't Bogle be like that instead of criticizing everyone and judging them by white people's standards of what success and beauty is? I guess it's true that you gotta work twice as hard as whites to be someone in this world, whites can be remembered for little things, few successes, Blacks gotta have many successes to get rememberance and recognition even for other Blacks to remember them. Bogle is one of the few black film historians, you would think he would write more positively of blacks in Hollywood but he treats many worse then whites treated them when they were alive. Bogle never mentions Willie Covan and Marie Bryant (and appeared in movies also and was a good friend of Lena Horne's too) who choreograhed many white stars, they were behind the scenes but contributed to Hollywood. He suppose to be giving credit not taking away. Either Bogle is too lazy or likes to show favoritism because he sure won't tell other unsung talents stories. If he does he clutter it up with talking about their looks especially if he doesn't know how to write about them. Bogle knows nothing about the great career of Nina Mae McKinney, the first movie star of Hollywood and Europe, who done more films then any other black actress of her time, the first to appear on many magazines, she had so many achievements, yet he gives her one little page, if you don't know about a person, I rather you not write about them at all then to write lies. He never talks about the Black Cinema independent movie stars or the industry who was apart of American cinema, I guess their too hard for him to research, so he takes the easy path in writing about stars he already wrote about a million times. He never writes about Ethel Moses, Francine Everett, Dorothy Van Engle, Edna Mae Harris, Margaret Whitten, Tomiwitta Moore, Bee Freeman, Lorenzo Tucker, Monte Hawley, Ralph Cooper (created the first black studio in Hollywood), Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams and countless other black movie stars who appeared in films for blacks made by blacks in the 30's and 40's, I guess that's too mediocre for him but they done more for the enhancement of Blacks in movies by creating their own images, own roles, own portrayals, playing people from all walks of life unlike ones in Hollywood who were stuck playing the same types of roles and being the same images he always complaining about well I feel give due to ones who at least tried to do for themselves and become what they wanted but see they weren't cross-overs so their looked at as non-important by some which kind of dictated by whites who we should remembered and who's important. It's hard researching Black Cinema stars but boy it's worth it plus studying them, watching them perform gives you a good idea of who they were even if you can't find info on them. I still find the time to give them due and I'm no professional or anything but Bogle is a high class guy who only likes to write about Hollywood and his favorite gals Horne and Dandridge.   Ive done more research on unsung, forgotten stars then he has and it has been pleasurable teaching others on the net about blacks who contributed to stage and screen, stars who were just as important as Dandridge and Horne. I'm glad there are other people who are taking it upon themselves to tell the true stories of many unsung black legends and don't write in the same fashion as Bogle. Anyone who is hung up on skin color and don't want to think outside the box and like to hear the same stories then Bogle is for you but someone like me who researched many early black stars of stage and screen on my own and found out the real deal, found how they really were, found how they were really looked at, and found the true stories wouldn't appreciate Bogle's work much. I've talked with some legendary Blacks of the early years, some of their relatives also and they gave a completely different view then how Bogle describes them which shows he just goes by hearsay and documents and don't do accurate interviewing and researching.  I would think Bogle would spend more time on talking about the beauty of  black women from dark to light and  their wonderful achievements to the world.  Black women are quite unique but instead Bogle tells the  story of black women from white people's perspective it seems, he tells how black women were looked at from whites perspective not from a true black person's perspective that has pride for his race, maybe Bogle has a white person's way of thinking who is partial. Because I would commend these women, embrace and make the world embrace their beauty, courage, and talents; their many gifts to the world isn't as nearly written about as their skin tones are. He loves spending time writing about how light, dark or mulatto someone looks. Again, he makes it seem like such and such suffered because she was mulatto, light or dark, come on man, if she had a tragic life it was her own fault if she suffered. He makes it seem like color and race was the problem for everything which is false, actually many of these women profited from the race sometimes and plus women in general face discrimination, no matter what race or color. Don't you think these women went through enough being judged by skin tone or looks, they wished in their life for being to judge their talent, at least give them that now, Bogle doesn't. Who isn't discriminated against in this world? Bogle makes it look like Black is a curse when these female performers change the world and introduce the world to their greatness and the greatness of the race. He loves talking about whether someone should of passed for white or not like when he's talking about the great Fredi Washington. He misses out on showcasing  other great talents like Valaida Snow, Blanche Calloway, Una Mae Carlisle, Eunice Wilson, Adelaide  Hall and  others but that's okay because they have  been written  beautifully about by other writers. Well, many are dead so they cant stick up for themselves and Bogle takes advantage of that, he hasn't even interviewed or actually talked to ones who he writes about, he just goes by hearsay. Have your favorites but when you write a book, you can't show favoritism which he does all through which hurts others who has a story to tell but he only give honor to his faves. It seems no black can make him happy, he always has something to criticize. In his words every Black woman is a tragic, confused mulatto and every black man is a coon, or some other stereotype, he wouldn't say that to the young black guys or gals in entertainment today though, he takes advantage of the dead who can't stick  up for themselves.  There is a website on unsung black talents of stage and screen, you all will enjoy. http://www.angelfire.com/jazz/ninamaemckinney/ 
 What it boils down to is this... The Godfather Returns is an attempt to fill in some gaps and tie together some plot threads left in the Godfather Mythos. The result is a chronicle of events that have very little relevence or enhancing value to what has been written before. And when relevence is reached for, through what is supposedly the unifying plot, it comes off as a ham-fisted retcon that feels like nothing more then an excuse to put "The Godfather" on another book. The Rat Pack-like group of characters that includes Johnny Fontane, and the political family that is a carbon-copy of the Kennedys make this feel more like a Harry Turtledove alternate history then a gangster novel. (with apologies to Turtledove) Puzo was no genius and had his own stinkers, but when he shone he shone bright, and this novel doesn't even flicker momentarily. I'd only reccomend this book to hard-core Godfather fans who must know every facet and fact about their favorite characters and are open-minded about their treatment. Anyone else, I'd advise to just watch the Sopranos or something 
 With the X-Men feature films and the hit Ultimate X-Men comic opening the world of X-Men to new fans, X-Men: Evolution takes the established characters fans have loved for years (Cyclops, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Rogue, Shadowcat) and puts them as high school students living at Professor Xavier's mansion with Wolverine and Storm as grown up instructors, and a new character named Spyke is introduced as well (whose powers are distinctly similar to that of Marrow, a former X-Men member in the comics).  Many longtime fans didn't find the series too likeable because of the way it is presented, and X-Men: Evolution doesn't hold a candle to the early 90's Fox show.  Nightcrawler's characterization is terrible, and there's too much teenie bopper type mellow drama going on with high school kids.  The animation is decent, but it's not as gritty as the Fox series.  The later seasons however, in which beloved characters Gambit and Colossus are introduced (and they do battle with Apocalypse), are much better than the episodes contained on these discs, but all in all I'd stick with the Fox series anyday 
 Once again QuickBooks dangles promises to us Mac folk that just don't add up. If you're like me, your accountant and bookkeeper are on Windoz - that's why I was psyched when I thought I would really be able to share my Mac QB files with them, and vice-versa. Mistake #1 - I give my bookkeeper a backup from QB 2006 before I updated to 2007. BIG mistake. QB is not backward compatable. So when my bookkeper sent the file back to me in Mac format, (after spending hours updating it), I was not able to import it into QB 2007. To me, this is nuts. But the helpful tech person we spoke with, suggested that even if it had been '07 this sharing business between Mac and Windows versions is sort of a one time deal. This wasn't intended to be a back and forth thing, between Mac and Windows. Huh? So what's the point?  Here's my work-around: I bought a used XP box on eBay and am trading my Mac '07 for Windoz '07. 
 In a perfect world this book would be 100% correct.  Global warming is a problem.  Poverty is a tragedy.  Immigration is a fact.  A `war on want' would be nice.  But in order to fight the `war on want' one must first eradicate hatred, intolerance, racism, nazism, Islamism, communism, terrorism and all other types of -isms.  Throwing food at intolerant hateful people doesn't make the problem go away, it just makes them hungrier.  This book ignores fact and whitewashes the world.  England is not `caught between America and Europe'  rather England is being taken over by intolerance.  But it is intolerance towards the west that sweeps the world today.  See Immigrants don't have a `natural right' to immigrate where they please.  In fact the greatest threat today is that countries in Europe, namely Holland and France, will be overrun by immigrants in the next 20 years plunging the European continent into another dark age.  In order to fight the war on poverty that will supposedly solve all the worlds problems one first has to learn the lesson of the Marshall plan.  You have to first beat your enemy into submission before you raise him up in your image.  This was the approach used in Germany and Japan in 1945 and it has succeeded.  If this book were to have suggested this policy, it would be accurate, but simply throwing money at a problem only makes the problem worse, Africa is a showcase of this.  There are 50 times the amount of aid organizations in Africa today then in 1960, and yet Africans are poorer today.  How is that possible?  It is because of misguided ideas like these.  Seth J.

 Do not buy if you want to use with Palm OS! Spent two hours getting this book into my palm treo 600 only to have it not open. Transferred fine, just wont open. 
 The carver style of governance is a tad idealistic and perhaps overly optimistic.  I have read everything Dr Carver has written concerning this field and enjoy this material at an academic level.  But when it comes to  operationalizing this model in boardrooms I've seen it fail time and time  again.  Not to say that the model is flawed because in fact the model is  normative and conceptually complete.  However it doesn't capture that  element of reality from which, in my experience, the model requires -  practicality and real-world application.  Dr Carver's notion that Boards  can do without Finance and Audit Committees is very naive.  Most  consultants from the chartered accountant genre are saying the complete  opposite.  In fact most government policy initiatives are moving toward  more control of financial affairs of organizations for boards from charts  of accounts to fiscal policy.  So I don't think the elimination of Finance  and Audit Committees is realistic nor is it a terribly bright suggestion.   I guess my only crticism is that the carver model is far to idealistic and  philosophical for a practical application in the form Dr Carver suggests.   Sorry but a hybrid model of traditional Board governance and the carver  model may work given the commitment required from directors to  follow-though on everything suggested in that system of governance 
 After reading the other reviews of this product, I felt confident enough to go ahead and buy it as a gift for an 8 year old boy. He is learning multiplication tables now, so I figured this was a great present.   Unfortunately, once the batteries were in, it kept malfunctioning and when the dials were twisted to 2 numbers, it would read out two totally different numbers and give their result instead of the 2 numbers the dials showed. We tried over and over to get it to work, but it is a DUD!  I live overseas so returning it is not an option I am willing to pay the extra freight/duty for. I bought another Leap Frog product at the same time that I have not given as a present yet, I really hope it works 
 Much as I'm glad to have at least some of von Humboldt's very important travel writings availible, this edition is sadly emasculated.    While it does include the initial Amazonian phase of Humboldt's South American expedition, the narrative is cut short at mid-point, von Humboldt's stay in Cuba.  It's inconceivable to me that the editor would have omitted all of the author's writing on his exploration of the Andes, and in particular the volcanoes of South America.    Those excluded descriptions are not only fascinating to read today, but were also what most inspired readers in von Humboldt's own day.  As a matter of fact, von Humboldt's account of the Andes so inspired the 19th-century imagination, that the era's greatest landscape painters, such as Frederic Church, actually travelled to South American specifically to witness and depict the vistas which von Humboldt had recorded in print.  The integral von Humboldt, in contrast with the one presented here, wanted not simply to view and record exotic cultures and climates, but far beyond this to attempt as much as possible to experience the totality of the Cosmos in microcosmic form.  The closest von Humboldt came to this impossible experience was his rapid ascent of the large volcanoes of South America, insofar as in this manner he could pass, virtually, through all the Earth's various climates in a single day--an astounding and Romantic feat completely unavailable to anyone using this edition as an introduction to von Humboldt.    But none of the above can be glimpsed even remotely by the reader equipt with only the Penguin edition.  Because of the premature truncation of the text, one entirely loses sight of von Humboldt's overarching project, which was not merely a geographical descripton of the Earth's surface, but rather a geodetical construction of the World as an organic Unity.  Thus abbreviated, von Humboldt appears scarcely different from his Enlightenment precursors; we lose all view of him as writer who has passed through defiles of Romanticism.  Not the real von Humboldt at all.    Rather than making one rash cut down the middle, the editor would have served the reader much better by extracting key episodes from von Humboldt's entire journey.  As I said above, something is generally better than nothing at all.  But in this particular case, not much better 
 Is it me or is it the film?  I watched my copy of the special edition the other night and there were words missing from  the dialogue in various parts of the film.  Now I wish that I didn't give my gold version away 
 It's been quite some time since I read this book, and my tastes in languages have changed quite a bit since then, so it's possible that if I read this book today, I would have a different impression. However, I am doubtful that that would be the case, and as it stands, my memories of this book leave a bitter taste in my mouth.  The joke goes that "some programmers can write C/Fortran code in any language," and that is exactly the problem with this book. The compiler implemented within may compile correctly under javac, but it isn't implemented in a modular, object oriented way like one might expect when using such a language. Rather, the author seems to often use classes as little more than C structs, and methods as merely convenient ways of grouping together functions. I see now that the author also has a book on C compilers, and it wouldn't surprise me if the code herein was a direct port to Java, with as little redesign as possible.  I am certainly not an expert on compilers, and as I said, it's been quite some time since I read this book. The general information on compiling in this book might be useful, and I'll leave it to other people to make comments on that. However, if you are looking for a book that gives advice on what patterns work well when developing compilers, or what advantages an object oriented language might bring to the table in that arena, this is not the book you're looking for. This might teach you how to write a compiler that is, syntactically, Java, but it won't give you any insight on why you'd want to use Java over any other language 
 Beverly Hills Cop III~ Eddie Murphy is not a terrible movie. Then again if you compare this sequel to the two first movies then one must say that it is a disappointment. Eddie Murphy is not nearly as funny as in the first two movies and the script is half lame as if they had run out of ideas. The plot is paper thin, and a total hoot compared to the two previous movies. Man, I was really looking forward to watching this movie after having seen the two other movies. This is a mediocre movie at best and gets the 2 stars that it deserves. Not recommended. 
 An Autobiography of Jack Gantos told under the name of Joey Pigza. While Jack Gantos sits in his jail cell he tells you the story of how he got there. Young Jack wants to be a writer, but growing up in a poor family means that he doesn't have the money to go to school. So he goes to live with his grandparents in the Virgin Islands. Shortly discovering how much Jack drinks, they kick him out. 	From there, he goes to live with a family who have an extra room and he messes that up too when he gets sick all over their house. After going through that and a ghetto hotel, he goes home to St Croix to live with his parents and work with his dad. He makes minimum wage by making and shipping crates. When a gut named Hamilton comes in with blueprints for a special crate for smuggling hash he offers jack a job. Jack sees the opportunity to get rich quick and use it to go to college, he had no second thoughts. He ends up in a medium security prison for smuggling drugs to the US. 	I really enjoyed this book because I, myself have done wrong things to do good things. I've also thought about doing things to get money quick. It's easy to make bad decisions when things are hard in life. this is an awsome book for teenagers to read and i think everybody should read this 
 These come in both boy and girl colors. The picture shows pink, purple, and yellow bottles. I received blue and green bottles. I contacted Amazon who promptly sent me another three sets (all of the first three sets were wrong). In the second shipment they only got one set right. I e-mailed to return these as well. When I sent back the five incorrect sets the company would not refund my money because "they had already replaced the items". Be careful when ordering from this site 
 I attended a workshop with this dangerous charlatan. I was truly shocked by what I witnessed. This self-procliamed messiah had an almost hypnotic effect on his devotees. He appealed to their egos by telling them they are the "chosen ones" privy to the wisdom of the "ancient mystery schools." But there's a catch,to be a part of his special circle one must embrace thier darkness. "I am the darkness" is the mantra of those who follow this man. And the results are what you might expect puppet-like people who slump and then stand to attention depending on their master's pull of the string. 
 Ms murphy's books get better.As a late comer to these books I really enjoyed reading about how new characters came along I think the way the cats react to different events is really well done.Not owning a cat myself I would love one like Joe. but I suppose I'll have to make do with the neighbors cats who always seem to visit when anything is happening 
 The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful. JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen.  But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound 
 I bought this camera two years ago, the pictures were always perfect, even though from the sixth month it started getting stains everywhere, but then i found out that it was normal, not good but it usually happens to this cameras. But the worst of all is tha fact that it displays the Error 18 (E18), the lens gets stock and the camera won't work at all. I searched in google about it, because the user guide says nothing about this error, and then I read many reviews that said that there was nothing to do about it and many Canon cameras have the same defect... I am really mad and dissapointed on CANON, i will never buy a camera of this brand, and I wouldn't recommend it, unless you are willing to buy a camera for 2 years or LESS and then throw your money to the trash 
 I've never taken an economics class in my life.  I'd always heard that economists spoke a different language than everyone else, and in some instances, lived on a different planet than everyone else.  After reading the very enjoyable "Freakonomics," I decided I might be wrong, because if "Freakonomics" was an example of what Economics is all about, then it was fascinating.  So I went in search of a book on Economics that would also be accessible to the layman, and came across "Hidden Order," which only reinforced my earlier stereotypes.  Despite a great opening chpater or two, I put the book down after 5 chapters, as each one became more incomprehensible than the last.  I have no doubt there is some very good information in this book.  Unfortunately, it's written in a mixture of English and "Economics-ese" -- just when you think you're close to understanding what Friedman is trying to get across, he throws in a chart and some terminology that makes everything incoherent.  On top of this, many of the examples and explanations he uses make absolutely no sense...at least no sense to anyone who lives in the real world.   Perhaps this book would be useful to someone who has taken an Econ class or two, but if you haven't, you'll simply find this book frustrating.  Thank goodness I checked it out of library and didn't have to pay for it 
 Back in November, I started "The Diet Cure."  I was a little overweight, had low energy and mood problems.  Thought eating healthy would help.  Oh man.  Increasing my protein intake from the little (or none) I ate to the whopping 20g a meal that she recommends (and cutting down drastically on carbs) brought on a state of ketosis that caused a constant ache in my kidneys.  On top of that, my face started flushing beet red every couple of hours.  I was miserable and teary and almost passed out on the street. So I stopped the Diet Cure after four days.  Just FOUR DAYS of it and FOUR MONTHS LATER I am still struggling to deal with the mess it has caused in my body.  My doctor says it triggered hypoglycemia, which I have to manage by eating six carefully controlled meals a day.  My kidneys seem to have bounced back, but the mystery facial flush only stopped a week ago after I tried everything I knew to deal with it. I know that it's not Julia Ross's fault that I wasn't eating any protein to begin with, but I do think her advice was highly irresponsible.  Sudden, dramatic dietary changes can mess you up irreparably.  I have heard similar stories from a number of people now.  I wish I'd heard them before I read this book.  Sudden dietary changes can give you big, nasty, lifelong diseases like colitis or hypoglycemia, just to name the ones I've personally heard about. What's sad is that the diet she recommends is actually pretty good for me.  If she had advised me to gradually ease on to it over a period of 12 months, I'd be writing a very different review. So please please please, if you're considering following this program, make the changes gradually.  If you do it fast, what happened to me may not happen to you - but why take the risk 
 I'd like to review this. However, it's been about six weeks since I ordered it & it hasn't arrived yet 
 You know what's funny?  Monkeys and Midgets. You know what's not? This book, it's serious. Don't buy it. Get a copy from a Jehova's witness next time they come to your door 
 This is a text that, taken at face value, can destroy the understanding of the period it sets out to explore.  A caution is not enough for this book.  Its immense learning on a small range of things - useful enough for the specialist - goes with the most spectacular ignorance of the wider area, so that Gnosticism can be taken to embrace both Plotinus and Hermes Trismegistus, in fact anything that is not properly Catholic. Hans Jonas' problem is not specialization; specialization is only his excuse for what is an unconscious but almost deliberate refusal to learn certain categories, a refusal to challenge his own inadequate views on some matters, his unthinkng adhesion to a way of thinking he learned early - or rather, never learned at all, but absorbed as attitudes from the surrounding environment - and never challenged.  In particular, he assumes as obvious that heresy is inherently creative and orthodoxy inherently destructive (rather than the reverse), so that all the positive advances in religious history, from mysticism to monasticism, are to be ascribed not to the Christian Church but to his beloved Gnostic rebels.  I would guess that it is from this presumption, a fundamental and basic superstition that dominates his entire outlook, that he set out to study the ultimate in heresy, Gnosticism, in the first place.  He expected to find spiritual creativity and progress there, and he found - or rather, "found" - what he wanted.  It is not that specialization ruined him, but that the already accomplished ruin of his mind governed his choice of specialization.  That this sort of presumption in favour of heresy should go with a Bultmannite background - which logically should have no particular reason to go hunting in this particular preserve - only goes to show that sooner or later all heresies meet; if not on logically defensible grounds, at least on the common ground of the common hatred of orthodoxy.  And yet there is one last doom to which this sort of person is inevitably put: just as they think that they have taken the struggle against orthodoxy to its climax, they suddenly find themselves outdated and almost reactionary - in this case, by the rise of a new school of anti-orthodoxy associated with the name of Karen L. King, who, far from proclaiming the high merits and unique historical position of Gnosticism, proclaim that no such thing as Gnosticism ever existed - it was all a wicked intellectual construction put on their enemies by the nasty, colonialistic, male-imperialistic Catholics, which, after two millennia of obscurity, has finally been revealed by the lights of feminist, deconstructionist, non-judgemental theory!  Ain't life grand 
 This could be the dumbest movie ever made (and that's a bold statement to make when one considers that "Underworld" also exists).  Sadly, unlike "Underworld" there is no leather clad Kate Beckinsale to drool over. Instead, we are treated to a movie that could easily be confused for a map of the human DNA (but a human with an extra chromosome).  Jason Statham, so likable in "Snatch", "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "The Italian Job" is thoroughly wasted in this flick.  When he's not busy escaping from his tricked out house, driving fast whilst looking cool and beating up on clichéd Euro trash delivers lines such as "Rule #1. Never change the deal" and is expected to act with a straight face when he's the recipient of this type of drivel - "You're always complaining, except when we make love. Then you say nothing.".  Thankfully, the one thing Stetham is great at is keeping a straight face. But you won't.  Not if you have a brain, that is 
 I bought this book for myself, expecting to find some useful advice to help me organize my day a little better and to stay focused on priorities. I have been in management for 12 years and I expected this book to offer some new insights into time management and other daily challenges. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed and struggled to find some useful advice within the first half and have since put it down.   The book seems to target a junior audience with a certain type of personality that is more focused on fitting in and accommodating others, rather than those focused on leadership and results.   The book itself feels really cheap. I is printed on that cheap news-print paper like those crossword puzzle books.    
 Some peopel may find this book useful.  I am just begining to learn the APA format and I did not find this book to be user friendly.  I have had better information given to me from handouts from other books 
 Good story, terrible writing.  Anderson's prose is trite, unimaginative, and, far too often, simply laughable.  Which is a shame because the story is compelling.  This is a key part of the Star Wars extended universe, however. So, read it if you must.  But you've been warned 
 Only one good story here. "Beggarman, Thief" by Mary Janice Davidson is excellent. Unfortunately, the other two stories are just REALLY bad. I found 'Stranded" offensive , not erotic. "Light on Her Toes" is just plain silly. Who wants to read a romance where you have to keep flipping to the glossary every other sentence just to understand it 
 This may be a good book, but the price is outrageous.  You are not buying a book, but rather copied pages into a ringed binder.  And it is very small.  Also, if your child is dealing with anger the last thing you want to give him is a flimsy book he can just get angry at and rip up so easily.  That's the first thing my son did.  
 At first glance this book looked really good however, once I purchased it I found out that it was oversimplified. Mainly just pictures of patterned movements of where to strike an attacker, with no hope of replicating the movments in real life for the average person. The best book I have come across so far is Attack Proof by Perkins. Have a look at Attack Proof first before buying this one, you wont regret it 
 I recieved one of these for Christmas, I would love to tell you how it works.....but it is missing a plastic piece. Now to be fair, I lost it, in the confusion of Christmas it must have gotten tossed. I called Rival to purchase a replacement piece. What a joke. I emailed....no response. I called, they don't know what I am talking about (even though it is clearly listed in the instruction manual), or if I get a rep who does know what the piece is, they say they don't have one to sell, but if I want to pay to ship the unit back and forth,they will replace it. I have left voice mail messages for non-existent supervisors. So, instead of being happy to pay for my own mistake of losing the piece, I will return this to the store as defective and get the money back. They lose a sale, the store loses a sale, they get in return an unhappy former customer and a defective unit. DO NOT BUY RIVAL PRODUCTS, we need to start showing these big companies who hide in voice mail hells that we are tired of poor, illogical treatment 
 Unstoppable is truly a marvelous read!! I picked up the book while on vacation and found I could not put it down.   The stories are inspiring; it shows how anyone can achieve success if they choose too. Each of the 7 Characteristics have supporting stories, plus the personal action plans to help ones focus. And the quotes at the end of every story by the person in story are very up lifting.   This is a book I have and will continue to recommend. It can help you focus, be inspired and renew your spirit. You will realize you can achieve if you believe in yourself!! 
 the author took a fascinating topic and destroyed it by writing in a convoluted, unintelligible fashion--a lot of artistic claptrap, unfortunately--it's like witnessing a stream of consciousness acid trip at the Rikjsmuseu 
  They left out way to much!! I mean they kept going in circles with the same bands over and over again. Plus they dont mention alot of bands that had a big influence in the scene back in the day. Could have been way better 
 Although his interesting childhood kept you glued to the first quarter of the book, the rest is just a basic cowboy's life written with little or no techniques to keep you compelled to read every word. It is interesting to read, however, since he was a true to life cowboy. If I had to do over, I'd saved my money. 
 (If you don't know exactly what the title actually translates into, it means "Oh pain"). Coulter had a good idea, I will have to give her that much. But she just didn't do anything with it. At least, not anything that would make for a good book. The hero is everything that a girl shouldn't want in a man: He keeps a mistress (I have no problem with rakes being the heroes in a book, but not when they have a mistress after marriage) and he actually hits the heroine. And aside from that, I can't see at all why the heroine supposedly loves him. His only saving grace is his looks and the fact that he saved her--not enough for this odd couple. And the ending left me totally confused. Whatever you do, DO NOT read this book 
 I had very high expectations of this book and looked forward for ages for its arrival and was thrilled when I was informed it had arrived.  Immediate disappointment occurred upon seeing the book, it is no taller than a compact disc and not much wider.  I was expecting a much larger book not one where the picture on Amazon is just about actual size.  Still if the content of the book had been superb I wouldn't have cared that much. Very average effort would be being nice describing what is inside.  The best three signs in the book are on the cover, most are pretty average and have been doing the rounds on the Internet for years.    While some locations are specific a lot of the credits are also rather vague so if you actually wanted to find the sign for yourself you'll have a bit of a mission.  Also some of these photographs have been cropped so all you see is the signs themselves and not what surrounds, meaning we are seeing them out of context and they are not that funny in real life.  For example the Bind Persons Cross Here sign with the vague location of Australia (is actually at Nobbys Beach, Gold Coast QLD) does not show the school for blind children which is right next to it nor the other signs next to it warning motorists on the Highway to slow down due to the crossing.           If you've been using e-mail for over a year or so you will no doubt have seen the majority of these signs before.  In fact the best ones you've seen there you will find are not in here.  Don't waste your money!   
 I am very disappointed in this book.  I bought it specifically because I wanted to continue with Pilates even with two bulging disks.  Unfortunately, this book includes positions that my physical therapist said are most stressful on the spine.  He said never to use the "V-shape" position and that very position appears on several pages of this book.  The book includes the basic Pilates exercises that probably contributed to my back injuries in the first place.  My therapist had recommended a Pilates class taught by physical therapists.  I could not take that class and was hoping this book would be along those same lines.  It was not.  
 It's ideas are sound, but it's all stats. This year there was this much and hey look now it's tripled, quadrupled, whatever... Just reading the conclusions of each chapter will give you everything that you need to know. 
 This book is basically Marxist view of art, and what art is intended to accomplish.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing!  It does help you to examine your assumptions and beliefs a bit, and that's one of the things an education is supposed to do.  The book repeatedly hammers the idea that art serves the purposes of the ruling class.  This is beat upon to the point of tediousness.  There is also a chapter that can be summarized as "art serves the purposes of powerful men by trivializing women and encouraging them to think of themselves as an object d'art for the viewing pleasure of others.  Oddly enough, the book didn't really return to this them in the final essay when it talked about the visual image in advertising.  That's an arena where visual imagery is used to play on the insecurities of everyone, but especially women, to convince them that they are flawed and need __(fill in the name of a product)____ to be happy and respected and glamorous. Speaking of which, one of the more interesting points in the book (even though I believe it is flat wrong) is the discussion of the rise of "glamor" as a desirable trait.  I found the book interesting, and it irritated me, but only in a good way--By making me think about my views.  But it really is written from the perspectives of a trendy liberal from the early 1970s.  Instead of closing with a powerful message summarizing some important aspect of art that we have been taught, the authors even use the final paragraph of the last essay to point out that capitalism exploits the masses and coerces them to ignore their own best interest(that's literally what it says!).  Probably worth reading, but not a high priority.  The Penguin edition is compact and affordable, but the B&W images are so small that much of the value of the work is lost--You can't see details of the art being reproduced 
 It is clear that Michael Martin made up his mind that the Bible can't be trusted before even looking at the facts.  I have read "The Case for Christ" and "The Case for Christiantiy" and those books are much more balanced and thought-provoking than this.  It seems that Martin, like most critics of the Bible, are driven by a strange emotional desire to deny God.  They are not driven by the pursuit of truth.  The idea of God and Jesus BOTHERS them, to their very core.  Why is that?  Maybe they don't like the idea that we have someone bigger than us to answer to.  Maybe they want to think we ourselves are the true gods of this world and our lives, and anything that threatens that position must be silenced.  It is funny to me that these people tout themselves as being "open minded".  Michael Martin is not.  A more appropriate title for this book would be: "I have already made up my mind, so don't confuse me with the facts. 
 this is the absolute worst book i have ever been forced to and have ever read. i would like to add that i made a very strong attempt to get more interested in the plot of this book because it was a school assignment, but jeez, this was cruel and unusual punishment. when i think of this book, the word that comes to mind is "torture". i like a number of books and i love to read, i usually don't have a problem with book assignments, but this was just...just really mean. If you are smart, you will take my advice and stay far away.  
 As a South African acquaintance said to me... "I've never been able to finish a Gordimer book". I decided I would finish this book, and it is well written if in an archingly intellectual manner. But its tough  going...too detached, and ultimately not enough to keep you wanting to go  back. I chose it at random since I had heard so much about Nadine Gordimer,  but had never read any of her work.  Suggest finding another one 
 Not worth your money. It reads like a paid advertisement. Spends way too much time talking about how great the new Jeep vehicles are and how important it is to use geniune mopar parts. Very little actual reference material for the DIY enthusiast or wannabe serious Jeeper. What little reference there is, is for CJs. Seems like something they would hand out at a Jeep dealership.   I don't agree with a lot of what this guy says. What's this about only needing 33" tires at the largest? For me, bigger, sloppier obstacles = more fun = need more traction and clearance = bigger tires.   Take my advice - aftermarket parts are almost always the way to go for price, warranty length, and reliability - don't get your parts or accessories through Chrysler/Mopar if you can help it.  I recommend Jim Allen's books, such as the Jeep 4x4 Performance Handbook. Much better intro to Jeepin' 
 Let's get this out in the open:  I love Kenshin, I've read the whole manga, own the first 2 arcs of the anime, and both OVA's.  This movie had high potential to be good, but poor subtitling and voice acting ruined it for me.  Plot was good, and the movie gave some good fan-service to avid watchers.  It was very self contained, but you get to learn alot about Kenshin if you had never seen the series before.  I love the intro scene, it's one of my favorites in all anime.  I have a big problem with the English VA cast and the script, because there are huge differences between the 2 English and Japanese scripts that do not need to be there.  To top that off, many of the voices sound too dissimilar to their series counterparts.  The subtitling were good, but they decided to translate the attack names to English, which was very different from every other Kenshin dvd I've seen.  Not bad, but I found myself wondering which move the 'dragon hammer flash' was.  If you love Kenshin and must own this, buy it.  However, for a quality product, I'd have to reccommend against it, hence the 2 stars.  Go spend your money on the OVAs or manga instead 
 I read recently that Sheryl Crow's song "Good is Good" a song from her new album, was nominated for a Grammy award. Seriously,how much time and effort could it possibly take to come up with that. TNMC, also won a Grammy when it was released. I still can not understand why, but I do have a theory. Simply put, the music industry is more interested in image than musical talent and integrity. While only a mediocre talent at best,Sheryl Crow is deified. I realize that this is only my opinion(and I have a right to state it) this type of music nauseates me. There is so much music throughout the world to be explored and appreciated. Do not let some in the music industry to bombard and assault you with this type of musical drek. I do have a solution: all the record producers and industry personnel responsible for the above-mentioned "crimes" should all be sentenced to a jail term for however long it takes them to recognize true talent and get some "SOUL." Peace 
 In my 49 years, I've read literally thousands of books on many, many categories, but I've never HATED a character before the way I do Llian.  I struggled through the first three books but couldn't finish this one.   Karan is such an exemplary character with incredible courage and wiles - and she falls for this [DUD]?  Puh-leaze!   Like I said, I've hated books because of lack of story line, lack of action, etc., but I've never stopped reading a book because I hated one of the heroes(?).  Don't waste your money on the series like I did 
 I found this book extremely disappointing. The author takes a narrow view of how an individual firm can improve its competitive position by 'playing the environmental card'. Although he cites von Weisäcker et al: Factor Four, he does not seem to be aware of the literature that takes a much more systemic view of how to reconcile ecological sustainability, economic efficiency and commercial success. The book is perhaps useful in that it vividly demonstrates the limitations of a perspective that is centered on the individual corporation and its immediate competitive advantage with a rather blinkered view both of the scope for innovation and the wider macroeconomic framework within which business operates 
 I am returning this worthless book.  Large amount of totally false, inaccurate information.  Most marks displayed are bizarre, seldom -- if ever -- seen, and many are totally incorrect.  Book not worth five cents!!!! 
 The author, having spent his military life reading about leadership, tries to write a book about leadership.  What he ended up writing was a book about reading about leadership, and given his own limited writing ability, even his writing recommendations can't be trusted.  I'm going to go read some Heinlein and see if I can't get better recommendations than this 
 Having read and enjoyed the author's young adult book Hoot, and looking for a light adult read, I picked up this book which has the reputation of being funny and light.  Frankly, it was both of thos things, but within a hundred pages, it became eminently easy to put down.  I enoy a diversion reading book periodically, and have some adult writers that meet those needs, Thomas Perry and Harold Adams to name two.  This one didn't make it for me.  It seemed to be a lot of: given a hurricane, one darn thing after another for a group of characters I didn't care enough about to see if they ever got tied together 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 I bought the 32" version which is attractive and worked great for 34 days-THEN the picture died although the sound worked-I called NIKO customer service about 10 times-finally I was told there where no service outlets available in my area for repair. I then was told I must ship it back to the distribution center in CA. at a cost to me of $75.00 through UPS. Next they received it according to UPS on the 7th of the month but denied having it there until the 23rd. Then they said it was delived to them with structural damage and there would be a charge of $70 which they changed to $160 2 days later. (I packed it great with lots of padding and UPS wouldn't have picked it up if it thought it wasn't). Now I am out $235 extra costs although UPS gave me $100 back for my damage claim without checking it out. They then sent me a supposed "NEW" replacement that only worked in black and white-no color in the picture. They offered a 3rd TV but after the first 2, I screamed and hollered, with no success at NIKO, but the Tiger Direct people were nice enough to return my money after hearing of my problems with the manufacturer.  PS their remote sucks and you will find the no code works for your cable/satillite remotes so you have to use both-if you get a TV that works great, but if it breaks down---don't expect help 
 Saturday is catchy.  Roll Out is tolerable.  Area Codes is abysmal.  Now for content:  You can't talk about the content of Ludacris's music without talking about his contempt for women. I could at least respect Ludacris if he had respect for my gender. But he doesn't, therefore I can't have anything but contempt for him. Stop calling my sisters ho-es, and I'd stop calling you a m-o-r-o-n. It's simple. I don't see why Ludacris fans think women are just supposed to accept or IGNORE female oriented hate speech?  Ludacris is OBSESSED with sex and h-oes. It makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. Afterall, those who constantly brag about things are usually trying to OVERcompensate for a lacking somewhere else. Or maybe Ludacris saw his mother selling herself in a back alley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever. I guess if she had actually RAISED him and shown him how to respect women-- ALL women--then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is.   This guy makes me so sick to my stomach I root for Bill O'reilly to tear him a new a-hole.      I'll explain my views, I won't apologize for them 
 This what happens when you screw around with pro-tools and forget fix the mistakes. The guitar solo at the end of "Fearless" is so bad and phoned in, it's unbelievable. The keyboard playing is a joke throughout the whole CD, the guitar playing is brutally awful and lackluster, and the bass player sounds like he's playing two big rubber bands. Plus, if it's not the too many momentum-killing changes, then it's the lack of originality. No punch or intensity to be found on the whole damn disc. Oh, and let's not forget the singer, who sounds like he's singing through a tin can. Total Bull 
 MINUS 5 stars-save your money Vague. Covers mostly recumbent racing of decades gone by (who cares)-coverage of so called "modern" recumbents is little. Most brands covered have gone by the wayside.  So called "Homebuilder's" section elaborates on the obvious with a few small dark pics. Very few pics in the book and the ones in there are small, dark and black & white. The color pics in the center of the book, of course, cover racing 
 This book has its good points. If anything, it helps you put into words what you want  from a supervisor, but it is not very accurate. The online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you, or if they don't describe you at all. This messes up the results, and it did not describe me very well. I am not just in denial. I have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the Keirsey Temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. So, although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology.  As for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees, I'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate. The company I work for has done this, and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths (according to this book) are very unhappy in their new positions.  Your money can be spent better elsewhere. I say its only worth about $10 
 Are you kidding me?! It's a great performance and all, but ONE freaking hit or remotely recognizable song ("Hanginaround) out of 15?! They don't even perform "Mr. Jones." Wasn't the idea to have this show in New Amsterdam spawned from the opening line of that song? Would be better off as an internet only release, rather than a Nation-wide one 
 As with the Simpson's unfortunate "head" packaging gimmicks, there ought to be an option with Northern Exposure to opt out of the cutsie packaging and just go with a box. There are some of us out here who are interested in the content of what is offered - but completely disinterested in the "novelty" packaging that is more of a nuisance than a drawing point. What were the marketing people thinking?  It would be wonderful if, like the Simpson's products so inconveniently packaged, there was an option for a simple box 
 I have been a big fan of Tosca as well as the Kruder and Dorfmeister team for years.  The double CD set Sessions by K&D is the best downtempo collection ever, IMHO.  I was very excited to learn recently that there was a Tosca CD (Souvenirs) about which I didn't know, so when I sat down to give it a serious listen with my headphones, I found myself extremely confused and disappointed.  I did not understand this experiment.  I found it to be so irritating that it broke my heart.  I understand the need for artists to reach out and explore new directions, but not here.  Not Tosca.  I hope they go back to what they do best-- minimalist, deep, sexy grooves. 
 Warning! I resized my partition and when it restarted my computed could not boot. It destroyed my system and I had to format my whole drive.  Read all the reviews from this program carefully. I read them but did not believe them 
 This volume has some excellent material, but it suffers from the authors' lack of empathy for the Sant tradition of India 
 if you are looking for a D.I.Y. book on silk screening look elsewhere. this is more of a historical review of the process. the book was copywritten in the '60's so there isn't any "new technology" in  the content 
 I picked up this book because I had observed the females in my CS department (including myself) drop like flies. I was curious as to the cause of it, but there didn't seem to be a common theme, so I thought this book might have some insight. It didn't.  They cited several reasons women at CM were leaving, some of which were interesting, but the one that made me put down the book and walk away was when it claimed that it was because women are nurturing, and computer science needs to change to be more about using computers to nurture and care for people. To me, that sounded suspiciously like "Women aren't interested in computer science because it doesn't involve babies and ironing their husband's shirts!"  Reading about the changes they instituted made me retch a little bit. They talk about specifically approaching female students and having "women in CS" gatherings. While I'm all for creating a supportive community, if my university had done this, I would have turned and run the other way. The reason I enjoyed my CS department so much was because nobody talked to me like I was any different, or made an issue of my genitalia, I was just another computer science student.  Admittedly, a lot of my dissatisfaction with this book stems from my views on gender: I see men and women as fundamentally the same, but socialized to be different. Ultimately, they're all people. It seems like the researchers found that certain types of people (those who wanted to nurture and pursue a variety of interests as opposed to single-mindedly obsessing over one) were not succeeding in computer science, and those types happened to be overwhelmingly female. They proceed to refer to these types of people and "women" interchangeably, which I feel is inaccurate. They made an effort to get more people with vaginas in the door - regardless of whether or not they fit the type of person they just described (people who fit that description who happened to be male were just out of luck, I guess). I realize they're speaking in generalities, and not all people will fit even good generalities, but I think that they were inaccurate in this regard.  I think that, ultimately, recruiting women explicitly only serves to keep gender an issue and build the suspicion that female students were only admitted because of their sex. Instead of creating a supportive community of females for females, why not work on involving everybody in that supportive community? Instead of having dinners and get-togethers for women, why not have similar get-togethers to discuss sex and gender and how it plays out in the department? Everybody's got a sex, and in addition to supporting one half of the traditional gender binary, it could also create support for and awareness about the non-traditionally gendered 
 I was really dissappointed with this album. Having heard Juno Reactor's great work on such compilations as the Mortal Kombat Soundtrack, Mortal Kombat: More Kombat, the Matrix soundtracks and their album Labyrinth I was expecting a really great album here. But I found almost none of the compositions here were as intriguing and the audio engineering was much worse. I don't know what happend, but none of the tracks have the same punch as any of the other albums mentioned. Frusterating. :- 
 All I can say is pass me some aspirin. This is a dozy of a bad novel. As it says on the dust jacket, a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased. Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit. At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence. Not only does he deal with his family, but his brothers friend, a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.  And that's only the start of the plot.   Its really pretty bad, it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions. The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well. 
 This book is written in a very "folksy" style.  The author does provide instructions for constructing "home-made" filters and other types of equipment.  Regrettably, the paperback version of this book seems to be a xerox copy of the original hardcover edition.  All of the pictures are blobs of black and gray, which renders them essentially useless 
 The writing is good from a technical standpoint (I don't have to jump literary hurdles to get through a paragraph because the words flow very well).  The idea is a good one too.  What I can't get past is the character Robert Langdon.  Langdon is supposed to be a sharp academic but he seems to lack foresight in his cogitations and things always dawn on him at the last second.  Another thing I have trouble with is Dan Brown's knack for slowing the pace of the story.  Things will be running strong for a moment and then the author tries just a little too much to build suspense.  The problem is the reader already knows where the particular scene is headed and this attempt to build up for a critical moment leaves me wanting to skip ahead to the payoff.  Like playing fetch with a dog, you can only tease him for so long before he loses interest, especially when the dog has a pretty good idea where the ball will land after it's finally tossed.    This book is an easy read but I think it is a bit over-rated.  
 There is no basis to this book.. not science anyway.. Watch the HBO   Real Sports video about steroids..  Yes for kids.. roids are very very bad.  But this book just preys on fear.   In the USA these days.. find a way to scare people and you can make a buck.. LAME.  Just say no and save your money 
 I've used KVMs over the years and this is the first one I've seen that doesn't work with IBM PCs.  The manual suggests it's IBM's fault.  Returning this POS 
 First, this looks to be an excellent book -- if -- you eat eggs and dairy.  If you follow a plant based diet, this is not the book for you.  There are handful - count maybe 5 - recipes that don't have eggs and dairy.  It is possible to substitute Earth Balance for butter and tinker with egg replacers for the eggs, if you want to bother.  For some reason I thought that because it has Buddhist roots it would lean more heavily on plant-based baking.  
 In some translations, Baudelaire creeps up and stabs you. In this one he just sits and broods, smoking a hookah.   Richard Howard reduces Baudelaire to a pleasant middle-voice from which he speaks with only occasional eloquence. The translator here is a poet who is sensitive to the meaning of each poem, but he hasn't focused his energy enough on crafting his translations to contribute much that is better than the translations already done.  His introduction reveals that he is concerned more with "articulating a sustained structure" (in which he succeeds) than with giving any poem its "individual varnish" (in which he fails). The result, of course, is that few of these poems are brilliantly presented IN THEMSELVES, and we can appreciate this translation only if we read all the poems in sequence, thinking about their relationships.  Translation of Baudelaire demands a focus on every word, every line, every cadence. This translation has an agenda; it tries to capture only a fraction of the poet.  Most of these translations do not rhyme; and yet they are not literal translations either. The popularity of this book is that Howard makes everything sound plain and sensible. It is only when you look at the French that you realize how uncanny the original poems are. This book does not convey Baudelaire's lyric intensity, mainly because it abandons the music of the original. Howard is so bent on making everything plain English that he utterly misses the thundering rhythms of a poem like "Le Vampire". He translates "Toi qui, comme un coup de couteau / Dans mon coeur plaintif es entree" as "Sudden as a knife you thrust / Into my sorry heart." Bleh! What a lazy translation! Of course you CAN translate it that way, but it destroys the music of the poem, which severely weakens the reading of Baudelaire.  N.B. It's awkward to review a whole book of translations, since certain attempts will obviously be more successful than others. Howard is quite sensitive to the poetry of the original (he never misinterprets) and certain lines in these translations are indeed wonderful moments of poetic understanding: such poems include "Sorrows of the Moon", "I spent the night..." and "L'Heautontimoroumenos" in which he writes "I am the vampire at my own veins."  These are the finest translations in the book. Unfortunately, they're the exceptions, and other translators have written stunning translations far more accomplished than the typical translation here 
 This book is about as clear as 12 inches of lead when it comes to explaining concepts.  The author spends half of the text on digression bordering on preaching.  Variables are introduced with vague explanations as a rule.  There are tons of equations in this book with little or no explanation.  Terms are regularly defined and then used differently then previously defined.  The organization makes it of absolutely no use as a reference.  If you must buy this book for college, make sure it is in good saleable condition when you're done because keeping it would be stupid 
 Hannah's got a pretty stellar reputation, and yet, whenever I've browsed his books in the library or bookstore, they never quite grabbed me. However, lately, I've been getting a lot more satisfaction from short story collections than novels, especially when it comes to American authors. So when a friend lent me this collection of 13 Mississippi-set stories from Hannah, I dived right in instead of waiting my usual 6-12 months to start it. Once I pick a book up, it's 95% likely I'll finish it -- unfortunately this one fell into the 5%... I read five of the stories and started two others before finally putting it aside to return to my friends.  For whatever reason, my browsing instinct was dead-on -- I'm simply not in synch with Hannah's style at all. He's certainly got a certain distinctive mood all his own, kind of a grotesque minimalist Southern thing, but it never really hung together or engaged me. There are some great lines here and there, but the hunt just wasn't worth the effort. The characters tend to be the kind of eccentrics one often finds in such collections, but the stories they inhabit simply never got off the ground for me. Some of the characters traverse stories, and when this happens, there's a bit more texture, a bit more depth, but not much. Stories like "Snerd and Niggero", which reviewers all seem to love, just fell flat for me. Two men, a woman, some bawdy prose, she dies, they cope together. Blah. "The Ice Storm" left my consciousness the second I finished it. The one story I did like was "A Creature in the Bay of St. Louis", which is a nice little epic about a boy's fishing adventure. My guess is that it's purely a matter of stylistic preferences, and that like a bad blind date, Hannah and I just weren't meant to click. 
 I ordered this thinking it would be great for grinding up "big people food" for my grandson.  It could not even grind up a soft hot dog!  We kept trying softer and softer foods to see if it would be able to grind them but since the blade is a cheap plastic material (painted gray to look like metal!) it just couldn't do the job.  Sheesh, I mashed up a banana faster and better than this grinder.  Total waste of money.  Also, my husband tried to put the handle on the carrying case and it snapped right in two.  Junk 
 I'm going to say something that might sound odd: this is not a leadership book.  It deals pretty well with the everyday tasks and details of Churchill's style, but strangely not his "executive success in the face of adversity." And Hayward's assertion that Churchill's style is  like that of an executive seems a little red-faced: Hayward spends a lot of  time defending against Churchill's critics that Churchill was disorganized  and a bad judge of character.  In all likelihood, he is forcing Churchill  into a category that he does not belong: indeed, Churchill may have been  disorganized, but he was a darn good prime minister. My opinion is that  Churchill deserves more than this. In place of this book, I would recommend  Lincoln On Leadership 
 This booklet was offered as a bundle with another book I purchased.  The booklet itself is well done, but not very extensive re: the wildlife of Costa Rica.  It seemed to be a bit pricey to me, even at a discounted rate, for what I received 
 Well folks, looks like we may have the most over praised movie of the current millennium right here. ("Crash" comes close, but that film has a lot more detractors than this one, and many of those who liked it seemed to do so because they imagined, somehow, that it would "change the world".)  My beefs are not the same as most of those who don't like the film:  I don't much care that it may show an unrealistic picture of drug abuse, nor do I find it overly depressing.  Fact is, it isn't depressing at all cause I didn't care.  It's just boring and annoying, sometimes at different moments, sometimes simultaneously.  This not a good combination.  All right, here's a plot summary:  Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans, Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burstyn all do drugs, and this really messes up their lives. I hate to give it all away like that, but there it is.  The fundamental flaw is this: I don't like any of these people, so their pain doesn't mean anything, and since that is all there is to this movie it absolutely fails to have any sort of effect.  Maybe if Aronofsky had put more time in to characterization it would've worked, but now there just isn't anything there.  As far as what's actually in the movie, we've got  Jared Leto as a stupid chunkhead who has inane conversations with his equally chunkheaded girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, who wants to be a fashion designer, or something.  Beyond this we've got Jared's mother, Ellen Burstyn, who is a weird old woman and Marlon Wayans as Leto's friend who deals drugs with him at times and appears headed towards the big leagues.  I particularly love how there's no real attempt to make Wayans into a person.  He's got one flashback about how he wanted to make his mom proud and that's it.  The doubly sad fact is that he's the most likable of the three.  He at least displays a little life.  Connelly and Leto apparently just wandered here from a Bergman film and are so dull and slow that it's a wonder that the smack doesn't cause them to cease to exist entirely.  (Well, Connelly actually does coke, I think, but it fails to liven her up any.  Also, I actually *like* the Bergman films I've seen, so that's not really a fair comparison.)  They love each other, apparently, but since I don't even like either of them I'm not much interested.  Finally, Burstyn is mostly just creepy though her performance does take a turn for the hilarious as she goes off the deep end.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been funny if I cared about her, but we've been over that...    And I want you people to know that I'm not utterly heartless when it comes to movies.  I can care about the characters, but none of these people did anything for me, so the movie's dead in the water.  For good counter examples watch "Trainspotting", which has drug-addict characters with enough humor and life to be likable and interesting and "Bubba Ho-Tep", a film which displays the plight of the lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite being a silly horror-comedy with a mummy in a cowboy outfit in it.  On the other hand, neither of those movies is nearly as pretentious as "Requiem For A Dream", so watching them will do nothing to stroke your ego.  Still, if that's all you want to kinda find plenty of films better than this one for that purpose.    "Requiem For A Dream" isn't helped any by Darren Aronofsky's repetitive, derivative over-direction.  The trouble is, this movie hasn't got any plot to distract you from how redundant the visual style is.  There's nothing inherently wrong with any of his tactics, but they're hopelessly driven in to the ground, as we see fast-motion a thousand times, quick-cut montages a million times and plenty of wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk, and they are, again, impossible not to notice cause the plot sure ain't drawing me in.  I imagine that the overdone, repeating visual style is meant as a representation of the endless cycle found in drug use, but that doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining to watch.  The score suffers from the same problem as they use the same handful of themes over and over.   Truth be told, I thought this movie was pretty okay for about the first half, but then it really started to grate on me.  It became evident that no, Aronofsky wasn't going to introduce any new visual tricks and no, these characters weren't going to get any more interesting.  I looked at the timer continuously for about the last 40 minutes of the film, and was so uninvolved that the supposedly horrifying conclusion where all the characters really get it bad was utterly ineffective.  It was kind of uplifting, really:  Now that these tedious characters have finally hit rock bottom I can go do something else.  Now that's a good ending.  Grade: D+   PS This is 500 reviews.  I doubt if I will write 500 more, but who knows 
 A wasted effort from one on the most perceptive minds alive. He dropped his past standards on this book.  Only the gems of wisdom about human nature gives it value.  An unknown author would have had this book rejected, or at least criticized.  I agree with the following observations taken from other reviewers:  "The story was all over the place and the ending far from satisfying."  "The first hundred or so pages move at a glacial pace, and the author's disjointed manner of storytelling soon becomes confusing and annoying."  "Far too much of the book took place in flashback... vacillating from vague self-pity to vague longing to vague regret and back... Of the three pivotal characters, two are presented almost entirely in flashback."  "Too dense and slow moving... even though the language is always wondrous."  "...novel seems dark and pointless."  "numbing dive into the depths of one man's self-absorption left me gasping for air."  If you are new to Le Carre, read his earlier works first or you may never read them after this work 
 I was SO MOVED when I first watched Hedwig that I bought the DVD, Soundtrack and Broadway Soundtrack.  What a masterful bit of writing and performance; just astonishing.  After I listened to this tribute, I just couldn't write a positive review.  The magic and emotion is not there.  The feeling is gone.  I know this review is short, but not much really needs to be said other than:  Save your money and buy the original 
 This book was required for my intermediate macroeconomics course at Cornell University. I found the book to be very confusing, especially on the more technical topics such as the Solow growth model. I give Abel and Bernanke credit for trying to develop a unified, balanced approach to macro... which they do; unfortunately, the exposition is not clear and the book is extremely wordy and not concise. I highly recommend N. Gregory Mankiw's Macroeconomics text instead 
 This book is a total joke. My daughter and I had several sessions with Frances Firman Solario. She ruined my family. Frances Firman Solario did not encourage forgiveness like she writes in her book. She cast both mother and daughter against one another. My daughter and I were on better terms before we started seeing Frances Firman Solario. My daughter and I are no longer on speaking terms. My family is broken. I highly would NOT recommend this book or recommend that you use Frances Firman Solario as a therapist. 
 This novel is set in the 40's, when Elizabeth Short (the Black Dahlia) was found murdered, her body cut in two. The characters revolve around the investigation of this incident, altnough her name is changed. The chapters go back and forth between the views of two brothers: one, an amoral cop, the other, a Catholic priest, Monsignor, businessman, whatever you want to call him.  Neither one is likable, the 40's cop jargon is incomprehensible, and the Catholic politics/building programs are boring.  However, the murder is solved and the end is neatly tied up with a bow.  If old cop stories appeal to you, you might like this, but I'm sure you could find better.  Double Indemnity, for instance, is superior 
 This movie is a poorly made farce, on a par with a bad "I Love Lucy" episode.  Its only virtues are a fine performance by Pierce Brosnan, showing the "action" talent he later developed as Thomas Crowne and James Bond, and the Gypsy Kings' cover of "My Way".    Chewing gum for the mind.  Deserves zero stars, if it weren't for Brosnan.   
 Theory wise, the book exposes things relatively well.  However, I cannot get over how thoroughly maddening it is to be second-guessing the answers in the back of the book when you're trying to learn by doing.  For ...sake, it's the 3rd edition and it's still full of errors!  Inexcusable!  There's no way to build confidence in problem solving when many of the solutions to the odd numbered problems are wrong!  No matter how clear the theory, it's still a work in progress, incomplete at best.  It is, quite frankly, shameful to be passing this book off as some sort of learning tool 
 The first part of the is book explains memes fairly well. The problem is with memes rather than with the explanation which is clear. Memes are cultural units which reproduce via imitation independently of any positive effect on genetic fitness. Blackmore completely fails to establish that these memes exist as independent entities. Second of all Blackmore fails to unpack imitation which is the hypothesized mechanism via which memes reproduce. All one can do to unpack imitation as used here is go to the dictionary. The last part of the book pontificates a theory of living. One is just suppose to sit back and watch the memes reproduce. Clearly Blackmore fails to follow this advice as Blacmore holds a responsible position, has a family and writes books. The book gets two stars as memes were presented clearly but only two stars as memes are a bad idea. 
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 This item was suggested to me by my local birth center. I should have noticed the word "wrap", but I didn't give it too much thought. There are two main problems with this baby carrier: 1. You have to wrap every time you want to use it which is problematic if you have other kids who need attention and if you are wanting to use it out of the house. I live in SW Florida where in the summertime it is 100+ degrees. There is NO way I could stand in a parking lot, wrap myself up, put the baby in and get my other child without suffering from serious heat exhaustion. 2. It is HOT. Yes, this is a nice, stretchy breathable fabric, BUT, the fabric is much, much bulkier than standard baby carriers. Again, I hate to harp on the weather here, but there's no way I could take my other child to the park and wear this unless all I had on underneath was a tank top. I'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you had those special nursing shirts with slits in them. Otherwise, you'd have to jack your shirt up underneath the baby and the carrier to feed them. On the plus side, it's easy to get wrapped up and easy to put a baby doll in and out of. 
 Before believing what Biagioli writes read Michael Shank's review (Shank, Michael H. 1994. Galileo's Day in Court. Journal for the History of Astronomy 25:236-242.) and Biagioli and Shank's later exchange on the book in Early science and medicine Vol 1, 1996.   Shank concludes, and I agree, that Biagioli manipulates the evidence and does not "behave in the way in which good, honest, historians behave" 
 I have no idea whether Morehouse's story is true, or completely made up, but I will say it reads like the latter. I don't believe in conpiracy theories in general not because I don't believe a government would do something bad, but that they could successfully cover it up. It's against all human nature not to talk, especially about something big, so I don't believe secrets are easy to keep nowadays. That said, Morehouse's book reads like badly-written, paranoid "sci-fi"...not a well-written book, neither believable nor entertaining 
 I bought this book hoping for insight into "why most things fail."  What I got was a rambling argument grounded primarily on the similarity of the frequency distributions of business failure and biological failures (extinctions).  Frankly, the relationship hardly strikes me as logically necessary, and the relation could well be spurious (or coincidental).  But I'm no PhD and didn't give it a lot of thought, so I could well be wrong.    What I am certain of is that the book offered little else, no corrolaries, certainly no explanation of the reasons "why most things fail," and no other practical insights or knowledge.  Bottom line, wait for the book's appearance in the discount bin before buying 
 Gray is so far off the target when it comes to nutrition and exercise.He says women might gain weight from exercise? Didn't he ever hear about if you burn more calories than you take in you'll lose weight? Simple math Gray!Everything about this book smacks of sell,sell,sell! snail oil salesmanship.When will he  realize people have different needs bssed on individuality rather than gender.No one has any business making the blanket statements he makes,it's irresponsible. Another very corny statement is women get good brain chemistry from affection and cuddling,while men get good brain chemistry from sex.How much longer is society going to promote these  myths? Bad advice,irresposible and plain corny 
 This is the worst shark film i've ever seen. All of the shark attacks in the movie are done with shark fodage. And all of the shark fodage is outa all the Shark Attack films. The directer should be ashamed of himself. And one more thing,the sharks growl just like in Shark Attack 2&3. Do not buy this movie at all! 
 I would love to give this a review, but since I can't seem to get you to send it to me I have no idea what this book is like. Needless to say, I'm disappointed with AMAZON 
 My two year old really doesn't like this book.  I got it since all the other books we have by the same author are really cute.  This one is just a grumpy book.  I'm sure there is a lesson, yes, but I will find another way to teach my son that bullying isn't right 
 I generally admire Jennifer Aniston's work so I picked this up when the video store offered a second rental free with the purchase of two bags of popcorn.  Sadly, watching the popcorn pop was more interesting than the movie.  If you went to sleep after the first 10 minutes, you would't miss much since nothing really happens.  If it's a comedy, it isn't funny. If it's a slice of life, the lives are deadly dull.  The emotional level is so low-key you suspect the entire group is on valium.  Jenifer Aniston especially, seems to have phoned this one in.     Real characters?  As it happens, I've known thousands of real people over the years and not a one bears the slightest resemblance to any of these sad-sack characters.  If they're actually representative of real Americans then we're in big trouble!  My wife & I had the same reaction at the end of this one ..... "THAT"S IT??!!" 
 I did finally get to the end of this book, but it was just out of stubborness. Not worth the effort. A book review of about 10 pages would have been a better way to learn a little about this subject, 
 there are many reasons to rip apart this movie, there are enough holes that even NEW YORK rats could go through.  however, what this movie lacks, it makes up for with a nice presentation, bonus features and really good special effects.  the story is slim-unstable serum.  there is govermental paranoia, rediculous chases, cheese nudity, a slight look of HALLOWEEN(from the persons POV)--sort of DARKMAN look and feel to the actors in their roles, several nice killings and the typical no brainer ending(SEQUEL) hmmn?, the movie company was lucky it was filming on a dark dreary rainy days!!-lol.  movie is not bad. its better than most if you want to be entertained.   just try not to get too involved.  RENT IT.  
 The review on the cover of the DVD reads "A snappy, sexy thriller..." I must disagree. This was the most unsexy, and unthrilling movie I've seen in a long time. In my opinion Ashley Judd doses not fit this roll, it's almost comedic.  Twisted is poorly written and losely held to gether by okay acting. Seems the actors were doing the best they could with what they had. I have no doubt the producers and director felt the story had potential but they failed to realize that with this production.   The film's ending holds an interesting twist but too many lose ends are left to the viewers imagination. My vote? Just okay, nothing to write home about 
 At one point in time I considered myself to be LKH greatest fan.  I've been reading her books since junior high school.  I own everybook she's ever written, the entire Anita series, Meredith, Nightseer, Death of a Darklord, Strange Candy etc... I sat and read alot of the comments about her and I decided to add mine.  LKH is seriously slipping.  I mean honestly.  I have never been so dissapointed in my life as when I read her last book.  What happened to the old Anita?  The kick a#@, chick who saved the day and slaughtered the bad guys?  The Anita that mad you wanna drop everything because you just had to find out what was next? LKH's books used to be awesome they were perfect but somewhere she lost it.  As Anita progressed she just became sluttier and sluttier and then on top of that she's falling apart.  I mean Jesus does she have to sleep with everyone in the book?  A little sex is good, but when it completely takes over leaving no room for plot, it becomes ridiculous.  As for LKH and her snooty comments, the sex crazed Anita is not what started her fan base.  The smut she's writing now did not get her where she is today.  Maybe she should remember that.  I strongley recommend that if you want good reading buy her earlier books.  If you must read the new ones, go to the library because they are not worth the money 
 ok. maybe my hopes were a little high for this product to work. but, it ain't great.  first, let me start off by saying it does not fit C's or D's. i tried to cram my C sized bra inside but unless i wanted to bend the underwire, the thing just wasn't going to fit. maybe it will fit B's or A's,but i don't have any of those hanging around to try out.  desperate for this product to work, i tried wrapping a bra around the outside of the largest of the two ...er... compartments and then securing a garment bag around that to keep the bra in place. that did NOT go well. the bra became unraveled and a mess by the time the spin cycle was through.  i ended up using these items underneath my bras to support them while they are drying flat.  it's a great idea, but it needs serious improvement.  
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 This book allots much space to stuff you find everywhere - what is a pivot table, for example - and on matters of conjecture and taste -does a pie chart "accurately" portray the data, for example. This space could be put to better use.  The section most interesting to me is Chapter 7 (30 pages) - Creating Interactive Charts. Unfortunately, there are errors. Some are only annoying, for example, on p. 213 telling us to enter Sheet1!Dates when the correct entry is =Sheet1!Date (plural is a typo, and no equals sign means no success). Simple errors, but I didn't like trial and error to discover the correct entry.   Other errors are tougher to fix, as on p. 228 where we are told to enter =N(OFFSET(Dates,(ROW(OFFSET($A$1 ... etc)) (I haven't filled in all the line). This procedure doesn't work at all, and an explanation of how it is supposed to work is "beyond the scope of the book". In trying to fix it, I found my own interactive graph that plots every N'th point and automatically adjusts to fit the selected data. Is a thank you in order?  What can you do? Walkenbach explains (p. 327) that changes to a pivot table chart that cause updating mean that all formatting is reverted to default. He also explains that pivot-table xy-charts are not possible, and that efforts to get around this basically are trouble. This may be the most useful part of this book: it tells you what can't be done.  Bottom Line: This book is padded and contains errors that consume much time 
 Although I'm a great fan of the brothers work, I feel this album an insult to the serious Bee Gees collector.  The tracks here are not rare, new or even unavailable.  Time for Barry & Robin to get back in there and give their army of fans a treat instead of another compilation rip-off.  Even Robin's latest redition "A Live CD" whoooooopie doo, again songs of old hat.....I'm hungry for new material not oldies.  And please don't get me wrong, it broke my heart when Maurice died, my world stopped and I do sympathise with Barry, Robin and the rest of their family.  Being a fan for 30 something years I've loved their music since the beginning and will carry on doing so for years to come....But please some new songs are needed from the brothers.  So come on Barry get together with Robin and show us the great writing talent you still have.  A devoted listener talisman, Dundee  
 I'm a huge fan of David Bowie, Harvey H. and Wesern movies. SO this movie had winner written all over it from where I stood.  What a painful movie to watch. Both Bowie and Harvey looked as though they wanted to be somewhere else. With the notable exception of one tearful scene between Harvy and his Daughter in-law this movie was void of anything that could be remotely called acting.  Not surprising considering there very little story for the actors to leverage off of.  I wanted to like this movie.  Now I know why it was filmed in 1998 and not released in the U.S. for six years.  Save your money and watch it on cable. While it is interesting to watch Bowie try to pull off a southern accent (and he DOES sing Battle Hymn of the Republic) there's very little else going for it 
 I ordered this reaaaaal sweet yellow truck for my bouncin' baby boy billy, one for hime and one for me...  T'was real fun to play with, but mine broke and and billy's was still fine! Don't think it's fair, I want a refund for this tootin' fine truck.  Thanks. buy it. refuund it 
 I received this sheet and was immediately disappointed.  The quality is very cheap and it wasn't a perfect fit.  I am surprised that this is made by Graco - usually their products are good.  I would not recommend buying this. I would buy a regular crib sheet instead. 
 I bought the chair for my mother. She really wanted the chair so that she can start working out on it. She loved it. It looks very nice, the size is alot bigger than what I thought it would be, which is a good thing. The only problem I have is that every time she uses it, one of the screws comes out and the arm comes loose. She is very disappointed with that because she's afraid to use it now. I'm not sure what can be done to rectify this problem, but it something that needs to be taken care of. Aside from that, It took a very long time for the item to come in and I'm very upset with the fact that we had to wait so long to receive it, and now she can't really even use it! 
 I've had my Micro for over a year now, and when it worked, I loved it! However, I'm having the notorious ear phone jack issue; the sound is output in layers, and I am constantly trying to "reposition" my headphones to get full sound. My husband called Creative Labs for assistance, and he was told that it would cost him [...] per month for a "customer service subscription." After reading these reviews, it seems we'd be paying Creative Labs [...] so that they could tell us there's nothing they can (or will) do. Next brand, please...  
    Let me first say that I agree with Mr Dalrymple about how Opiates have been overly, and, at times, harmfully romanticized by artists.  An artist creates a great work of art, this artist's drug usage becomes common knowledge, and faster than you can say Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc, some idiot makes the assumption that drugs are a major ingredient in the creative process.  It is a dangerous assumption--the legend of Charlie Parker's heroin use probably destroyed more aspiring musicians then anyone will ever know.  And, for the record, any artist working under the burden of an addiction is creating in-spite of it and not because of it.     Now that that part is over . . . how about Mr Dalrymple's assertion that opiate addicts over-play their withdrawal symptoms so that they can get free drugs from the government?   I'm NOT an expert in the physiology of the brain, but doesn't it stand to reason that if opiates can trick the neuro-receptors in one's brain into something as drastic as shutting down the respiratory system, then doesn't it also stand that there could also be drastic physical changes associated with the altered brain chemistry of withdrawal?  That SEEMS logical doesn't it?  (Then again maybe addicts not only fake withdrawals but also fake the effects of taking the drug to begin with.)  But since I can't prove this theory one way or the other, I guess I'll have to stick to the other part of his theory: the supposed reward that addicts get for their little pantomime . . .  While it may be the case that Mr Dalrymple's government--the British Government--gives away free Heroin or Methadone, this is not the case in the good-ole USA where opiate maintenance treatment is definitely NOT free.  (Oh, and by the way, if the "sympathy" method worked so well then why don't people addicted to other drugs use this trick to get the British government to give them THEIR drug of choice for free?)  The thought that withdrawing gains you sympathy from anyone is just wrong, most people prefer to think that the addict brought it upon themselves and that this is, at the very least, what they deserve.  This surely appears to be Mr Dalrymple's opinion, as well as the opinion of one of the other reviewers who claims to be a doctor in the field.  I assure you as one who has been on the other side of that stethoscope that your lucky to get a doctor who is only chronically apathetic.  More likely you'll get someone like Mr. Dalrymple who is  contemptuous if not openly hostile.  And certainly wouldn't be inclined to give you free drugs. Try as he might to paint drug programs as being populated by bleeding-heart pushovers, this is not the case.  Most people--in the clinics and everywhere else--attach a huge stigma to Heroin usage, and the Heroin user.   The first thing most people do when they find out you are an addict isn't to shower you with understanding and loving concern, but rather to hide their valuables.  And when it comes to maintenance treatment in the United States, withdrawing or not, you have to pay.   So if maintenance programs, as used to treat opiate addiction, aren't based on misguided altruism, saintly charity, or even sentimental socialism, and if the system isn't universally populated by the most caring of people--Mr. Dalrymple being an example--then why do we have this system . . . aside from the fact that Methadone clinics are a profitable business.  Well, the main reason that our government here in the US (and the British government as well) really allow these type of maintenance programs to exist is because it can be statistically proven that they reduce crime, and also allow for a stability of life that the street drug lifestyle can never provide--meaning that the addict has a chance to hold down a job and become a productive member of society. (Though the "stability" part certainly is the less important of the two from a politician's standpoint.) Does anyone really think that the present conservative climate in our country would tolerate Methadone clinics for one second if the only reason for their being was to help out drug addicts?     So I guess by now you've figured out that I've had some experience with opiates . . .  Yes, I was a Heroin addict and am now on Methodone.  I've tried to kick cold-turkey and I can assure you that it truly sucked.  So was it all in my mind?  Well let me bring my own bit of proof to the table: to offer up a little bit of anecdotal evidence to the contrary and in opposition to what the "medical experts" would have you believe.  (Should my anecdotal evidence be any less valid then that of a jaded doctor?)  It is a common experience for people who buy drugs on the street to occasionally get ripped-off.  On more then one occasion I've been stuck (no pun intended) with something that was indistinguishable from Heroin only to realize a little while after using it that it wasn't.  So, if it seemed to be Heroin--if I believed it was Heroin--why didn't the placebo effect cure my withdrawals?  On second thought, maybe it did . . . maybe I am just telling you that it didn't so you'll feel sorry for me and maybe send me some money for drugs.  Seriously, If I included my address and asked you to send me money to keep me from withdrawing, would you?     While correct in suggesting that people's assumptions and prejudices about opiate addiction and opiate addicts are mostly wrong-- Mr. Dalrymple fails to mention that this dearth of knowledge also extends to what medical experts know.  The field of addiction treatment is studded with far too much bad science; and let's not forget all of those charlatans--every one with a new and miraculous cure--playing on the hopes of the addicted.  And ultimately, who can the addict turn to--they're only a bunch of junkies after all . . . who would listen?   With a system populated by the likes of Mr. Dalrymple, it's no mystery why the political will-power to make a concerted and methodologically sound study of the physical and psychological effects of opium addiction and withdrawal is non-existent.  (Especially when it's so much easier to just throw maintenance and a course of canned psycho-babble administered by unenthusiastic councilors at the addict . . . and to then blame the addict when the treatment fails, and not the system.)  For example, while the symptoms of opiate withdrawals might appear flu-like to the observer, this is not what the experience feels like to the person withdrawling; It is difficult to relate the experience because there is no frame of referance at this time.   And while some of the physical symptoms ARE best described as flu-like, there are many additional physical symptoms that are not . . . and then there's the psychological anguish that is in no way like any flu that I or anyone else has ever had.  But since these are not easily quantifiable, and because no one really cares that much about it,  doctors tend to fall back of the old flu-like symptoms description.  Which brings me to Mr. Dalrymple's disdainful assertion that withdrawals can't be worse than the flu because the flu kills people and withdrawals rarely do--yet another mean-spirited logical fallacy.   Besides, while by themeselves withdrawals don't often kill, they DO however drive the addict back into drug use, and that is what kills them.   So what does it all mean?   I think it's about preconceived notions.  Prejudice is a strange thing; the more you look at people's beliefs the more you come to realize that more often then not the prejudice come first and the justification come afterwards.   Like the way that a knee-jerk racist will turn to Social Darwinism, Eugenics or even the Bible to prop up their claim to superiority.  It's funny too--in a sad way--how the flawed logic of prejudice is often mirrored by flawed science; starting with a conclusion and then cherry pick statistics to prove it.   I suspect that Mr. Dalrymple has grown to dislike the people that he sees in his system everyday.  So much so that he professes to admiring Chairman Mao's solution for opiate addiction . . . can you guess what that might be?  So he brought out his broad brush and painted this book-form tirade asserting that every single opium addict is fundamentally weak-minded and deceitful.  And thus they are truly worthy of his scorn.       And it seems that now, more then ever, there's a huge audience for this type of thing.   It appeals to the easy-answer-to-a-difficult-question crowd, who just love to have their prejudices reinforced by "experts."   Imagine how it assuages their conscious to read that they where correct all along for hating drug addicts, after all, a doctor says it's the right thing to do 
 A Recipe for Bees reminded me a lot of the novel Vinegar Hill. In both stories, a wife is living in a dark, unpleasant home environment. In A Recipe for Bees, Augusta, an older lady, approaching the end of her life, reflects back upon her childhood and her marriage. Her mother dies at a young age, leaving her alone with an unaffectionate father. When she meets Karl and they become married, Augusta moves from one unaffectionate household to another. Living at Karl's father's farm, Augusta is only subject to more withholding of affection and is living a dark and depressing life. The rest of the novel delves into Augusta's search for independence and what she chooses to make of her life. The story takes us down journeys of the ups and downs of marriage, being a misfit in the community, and mother/daughter relationships. The main problem reading it, is that I couldn't find it in me to like the main character, Augusta. I also felt that the story left the reader with a depressed feeling of what marriage is like.  The weaving of the "bee" theme added a nice touch to the story, but if you're looking for a great read with a "bee" them, try The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd. The writing in A Recipe for Bees was good, but I felt the story was lacking something 
 As a teacher, I read a lot of books about education and childhood development.  Real Boys is typical of most of these books in that the author takes 500-600 pages to say what he could have expressed in 100 pages.  Read the first chapter and you get the point of the whole book. 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 I am on page 95 of this book and have not found anything redeeming yet!  I won't finish this one! Poor Scarlett!  She is beautiful, with a decent job and her own condo!  Wah-so now she has to make herself look ugly to see how the other half live?  I also REALLY did not appreciate the TB character-Token Black?!?!?! Not only is it not funny, but is actually just racist!  I am glad to take this book back to the library but I won't get the time back that I invested in the 95 pages I have already read, that took me nowhere!! 
 This is the most demented book I have ever read. The author tries to suggest that Native Americans were just as "human" or destructive of the land as western people. Um....has he seen the land lately, it's a little changed since the English first arrived. It's mostly gone, covered with asphalt, and the animals? They are gone too. Of course they used the land they we human beings but to suggest that they were of the same mind as those that followed is a reach 
 My wife and I were REALLY dissappointed in this book.  We finally gave up after the first chapter.  She rambles on and on.  She uses a lot of words and terms that the average reader won't know.  If you have ever heard her speak on TV, then you know what the book is like.  She talks fast and that is conveyed into the book.  What is really sad is that she curses in it.  For being a "Christian" she uses a lot of BAD words.  We DO NOT recommend this book at all 
 Was there nothing good that he could have said about her?  Surely being famous for 40+ years she must have done something right...according to this author, NOTHING!!  Don't waste your time or money on this.. 
 I bought this book hoping that it would teach me a little theory a little easier than lets say something the size of war and peace. I found it to be hard to read and understand 
 Although Robin McKinley's stock heroine of "tall awkward ugly girl who loves horses and hates dresses" has worked well in other of her fairytale retellings*, this one is a distinct disappointment because it seems that that's all there is to Princess Briar-Rose. Even being the central character of the tale, she seems to have little personality other than the above attributes, which are emphasised to make sure the readers know Rosie would make an awful princess. Indeed, none of the characters in this book are particularly memorable, except perhaps Katriona who rescues baby Rosie as a teenage fairy agonising over her inability to do magic.  The plot is little better - events seem random and contrived, and the resolution to the problem of the missing princess is more than predictable by the time the reader reaches the second third of the book. Again, this is a let-down because other of McKinley's fantasy novels are well woven together.  One innovation that I did like about this book was "baby-magic" - a phase of uncontrolled, temperamental magic that fairies go through as toddlers - not relevant to the plot at any point, but an amusing distraction from its mediocrity. Note that fairies in this book aren't little people, but simply humans born with magical ability.  *Beauty, The Outlaws of Sherwood, Deerskin, etc 
 This book as has been said "is a completely different book and not worthy of being called the second edition of such a good book". Oreilly has dissapointed me for the first time, since most oreilly perl books are excellent value and of a high quality. Instead as in the first edition that covers a good range of advanced topics this book chooses some rare and obscure ones. This book is of little use to the programmer whom has ever picked up the cook book or perl programming by same publisher. Unfortunely for me I did not have the chance to see the book in person, or a truthful review. 
 Wasn't quite sure what to think from this earlier film from Ruggero Deodata, who brought us the universally "infamous" CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. I figured it wouldn't be nearly as rough or "controversial", and I was right. But JUNGLE HOLOCAUST is decent film in its own right... But seriously after watching this it wasn't all that great..... it was a bit ridiculous if you ask me.   The reason is this, there are only two good cannibal scenes, and there are some unnecessary animal deaths through out this film. I'm not saying that the animal deaths bother me. I just think that it should have a reason. If you are going to kill an animal for a film have it have a purpose. For example in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST when the turtle died they ate it afterwards. They actually used it! In this trash of a film a huge snake dies for no reason at all! An the scene when the crocodile gets slit open while its still alive, has a point, but I found that it still wasn't vary necessary. This film was not worth taking a life for! Its pure trash! there are really only three actual gore scenes. A tribal man gets his hand eaten by ants (which looks extremely fake!) The only good scene in this movie is when the girl that is helping our lead character gets eaten! That scene was awesome! that was the only thing that I found to be rewording in this film. This film basically drags out for a long time and has random pointless acts that go on for no reason. The one scene that annoyed me the most was when the tribal girl that is helping our main character escape from the cannibals is raped. An she is not raped by some one from the tribe, or some one fallowing them, she is raped by the person that she is trying to help! An for no reason at that! He just chases her down and has his way with her! It is pointless! An for some reason after this whole ordeal she finds respect for her rapist!   This film doesn't make sense! If you want to see a cheap cannibal movie that is enjoyable then go see Mondo Cannibal or Cannibal Terror. This film is worth watching out of curiosity, but don't waste your money. It's not that good. Rent it first if you can I'm glad that I did. 
 I couldn't even finish it.... I thought the stay-at-homework was clever,  the information was useful but there was no spark, no pizazz, nothing special here.  It bored me 
 What Johnson neglects to mention is that Biblical Creationism is Darwinism's perfect foil: an ancient absurdity that most Free Thinkers, "Trekkies" and Unitarians naturally reject in favor of Victorian science.  In short, Darwinism's saving grace is that most of us, inexplicably, feel compelled to believe one or the other.  Without Christian Fundamentalists mucking everything up, Darwinism would perhaps be treated to the scrutiny that all influential theories deserve (e.g., Marxism, Freudianism, and other narratives imposed upon reality).  Questions worth considering include: Darwinism's genealogy (the attempt to apply Malthusian economics to biology), Science as Fetish - or Public Idol - rather than methodology (compare with the modern [mis]use of the term "terrorism"), Darwinism as Psychological Warfare (if the Ruling Class can convince the "lower orders" that they're animals, perhaps they won't complain so.much when they're treated as such), Darwinism as the motor mechanism behind "scientific racism" (the appeal of neo-eugenicists [the Pioneer Fund crowd] to evolutionary theory), Darwinism as Cultural Imperialism (the catchphrase of the old British Empire was "God is an Englishman."   And who better to topple him than another Englishman?) & Darwinism as an expression of 19th c. Anglo-American philosophy (i.e., Logical Positivism).  
 Never charged a thing.  I bought it to use on international travel. It stated that it could be used on 220 and it burnout out shortly after being plugged in 
 The 2 stars is the average I give to all the fable books written by Patrick.   The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: 5 stars  Obviously, it is the best one. (you can see it from the sales record in Amazon). It was the first Patrick's book I read. I have finished reading the whole book in one setting and couldn't wait and jump to look for his other books. The book has a reasonable length, setting up a bit simplified, but not over-simplified, and still reasonable fable-like setting to illustrate all important team dysfunctions and team building skills. The whole book is tight and coherent and an easy but enlightening read. Highly recommended!    Death by Meeting: A Leadership Fable 4 stars  It is a good one but not as great as the five team dysfunctions. A very good explanation of all kinds of meetings and how to use each of them. I recommend you buy one, read it and keep it as a reference. One drawback is the author tried to spicy up the book so one of the main characters will occassionally scream out some rude comments if he didn't take his pills. I never work with such an unusual person and I prefer less dramatic in a management fable. (not something like in "Desperate Housewife", the neighbor besides you was a serial killer and the housewife across the street did her gardener and used her Chinese maid to bear her baby.)   I should have stopped here and never rush to read his other books..    The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive: 2 stars  This is the one made me begin to feel betrayed. If the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within weeks. The fable setting needs more polishing works. Although the four obsessions have been presented with reasonable clariy, reading this book makes you feel that the author thinks you are an idiot. Scenarios like how the VP HR plots to damage the trust seem to be more suitable for a toddler fable rather than something for teenagers, not mentioning for managers. The rough plot affects the whole four points--though four very good points. I will recommend you to skim the whole book in less than 20 minutes by standing in a bookstore.    Five temptations of CEO 1 star?  It is the one makes me begin to feel angry. Again, if the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within hours. The major story (95% of the book) happened in a dark train, where a poor CEO was taught about these five temptations by some ghost-like old men, who turned out later to be the previous CEOs in the SAME company! Again the five temptations are all great and worthwhile points. It is the plot that made me sick. If you have a chance, skim the whole book in less than FIVE minutes.   Silos, Politics and Turf Wars NEGATIVE 1 star  The worst one. Negative 1 star is because it wasted my time. I thought the five temptation one was the worst until I read this one. Patrick spends most of the book to illustrate the silo problems rather than provide any solution. And he even spends many pages about the main character's struggle in balancing his work and his wife's pregnancy, which I believe, should belong to another fable about personal life balance, given how many pages the author devoted to this. From other fables, more or less, you can at least learn something. But not from this one. Forget it!  
 Is there an option for zero.  The worst I book I have ever read.  He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep.  I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS 
 Inspired by his uncle, Eddie, who worked at an amusement park, Albom writes a well-coordinated tale of people who connect here and in the afterlife, which is described by him as a very materialistic ambience. The concept is old: a better life beyond and a reason for the people with whom you cross paths. There are concepts to be learned from the five people. The story is delightful and cavalier.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope and South State Street Journal 
 "Reefer Madness" (originally "Tell Your Children") was created to teach parents that it's never too early to scare the holy crap out of your kids.  Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin.  We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.  Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:  - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street  - playing the piano too fast  - having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much  - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well  - having no recollection of being framed for murder  If your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict.  The solution is simple:  force them to watch "Reefer Madness" because if we don't heed its warning, "Reefer Madness 2" will be coming to a theater near you or you... OR YOU 
 After reading "The Kite Runner" - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship, loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in Afghanistan during the Russian war and the Taliban rule, I set out expecting more of the same from the Swallows of Kabul.  The latter was quite disapointing.    The Swallows of Kabul focusses on 4 main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence, cruelty and desolation of their surroundings.  The dismal context of this story is properly set up.  Enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the Taliban and the desperation of the Afghan people is clearly communicated. Unfortunately, the novel reads like a short story.  Proper character development is not established, so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits.    The novel is successful in  painting a truly depressing picture of Afghanistan, making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place.  But if you're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances, then I wouldn't recommend this book for you.  I was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down 
 This instant-expert in Hawaiiana is evidently one of those people who move to Hawaii and think "it's much too good for the Hawaiians so I'll sell as much of it as I can".  The photography is good but so many of the descriptions are soooooo wrong that I looked through it in slack-jawed amazement.  Don't fall for this phoney-baloney aloha - the real Hawaii is not for sale, no matter how many books you write badly about it 
 If you get an edition, such as "Signet Classic", that includes The Spooniad and the Epilogue, then you will have three bad works of poetry to wade through, the last two blessedly short.  The idea is a good one; a series of monologues from dead former townspeople, touching the major incidents of their lives, many of them connected, sometimes in surprising ways.  But Masters is just not a good enough poet.  He attempts blank verse monologues in the style of Robert Frost (as in North of Boston) but succeeds only in demonstrating how difficult a form it is and how it takes the brilliance of someone like Frost to pull it off.  I can see that a few of them are worthwhile and would themselves make good anthology pieces, but mostly they are simply second rate prose poems of no significance.  In my review of Winesburg, Ohio I compared Sherwood Anderson unfavorably with Masters, saying that he lacked Masters' humanity.  But - like most people, I suspect - I had only read selections from Spoon River.  Now that I have paddled the length of it, I can tell you it is meandering, flows very slowly, and contains very little life. 
 This novel is hideously overlong and completely unfunny. Eudora certainly knows how to create an atmosphere, that much is true, but this is an atmosphere I was eager to be done with, featuring the most miserable family reunion and godforsaken little town I've ever heard of. Don't waste your time 
 I generally like Elmore Leonard, this is the twelfth book of his I've read, ranging from his Detroit crime capers, to his L.A.-set Chili Palmer stuff, to some of his Westerns. Other than the terrible "Be Cool", this is probably my least favorite of his books so far. Set in the years between the end of World War I and 1934, the story follows Carlos "Carl" Webster from boyhood to manhood as the son of a wealthy pecan farmer rises to became a hotshot U.S. Marshall. The story takes place in the dusty Midwest, mainly around Tulsa and Oklahoma City, as Carl faces off with various wanna-be desperados seeking to make a name for themselves.  Carl is a somewhat vain, cocky lawman, with a keen sense of what kind of quote will get him in the papers. His main foe is the son of a wealthy oil man, a no account young man who has everything he needs, but whose selfish nature and appetite for stirring things up leads him into Carl's path. Mixed into this are kinds of period details, from prohibition to Will Rogers shows to Klansmen vigilantes to "True Detective" writers to striking miners to mentions of various real-life bank robbers Pretty Boy Floyd, John Dillinger, and Bonnie and Clyde Barrow.   Despite all this background detail, the story itself failed to engage me. There are none of the clever twists and turns that characterize Leonard's best work. There's a good guy, a bad guy, and an inextricable outcome whose resolution is surprisingly undramatic. In fact, about halfway through the book I realized that the "real story" wasn't going to kick in -- I was in it! And unlike many Leonard books, the supporting cast of characters isn't particularly memorable. Even Leonard's trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing, subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech. Ultimately, one gets the feeling that Leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period, and perhaps didn't spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story. That said, the Depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story, given the time and place. All in all, unless you're really really into the whole '30s gangster thing, not worth the time. 
 I do agree that books containing racist positions should not be given to children without a strong and fully aware comment. But I simply cannot stand to buy a sanitised version of a book without being aware of it. This is called censorship, and it gives me the creeps. As a parent, I have had enough real life opportunities to prove racism wrong to my children. So to realise that somebody has been cheating on me, trying to do my job so that I did not have to explain how society has evolved, how difficult it has been for minorities to be recognised and respected is just a fraud. this review is about the Harper collins Edition , edited by Patricia C. and Frederick L. McKissak, illustrated by Michael Hague 
 This is an OK book, if it's the first of the series one has read.  However, for those who have read Fluke's earlier "Hannah" mysteries, it is a crashing bore.  Hannah, her mother, sister, suitors, etc. are interesting, well-delineated characters.  The problem comes with Fluke's setting: her idyllic, Minnesota village is such a great place that readers of more than one of these cozies know from the outset that the crime was committed by an outsider.  This series has become the most formulaic I have ever read: Hannah will dither between her two suitors, Mom will continue to be charmingly demanding and eccentric, everyone will need block heaters in the Minnesota, and I won't read any more Hannah Swensen mysteries 
 I'm what I would call an advanced C# developer, but have always felt I could use some education in accepted design patterns.  I thought this book would be a great start.  Boy was I wrong!  I second every complaint I've read in these user reviews.  That said, I'd like to add one more to the list:  Often there was nothing in the text to explain how exactly the example code exemplified the pattern being discussed!  This was maddening to me--you get some bad code, then an unnecessary line-by-line description of how the bad code works, but you're no closer to understanding the proper application of the design pattern 
 This is a terrible book, written by somebody who is totally ignorant about football (please, use the proper name for the game) and seems to have decided to write a book based on secondary sources, puff pieces and ignorant oversimplifications.   It would take too long to discuss the numerous inaccuracies, exaggerations, mistakes and so forth present in this horrid tract. Just as an example, when dealing with Jewish football he never mentions the peregrinations of Israel through UEFA and Oceania (for WC qualifications). Yet this would be exactly the kind of topic to be dealt with in a book purporting to explore the intesection of 'soccer' (sic) and geopolitics.   Compare this with Kapuscinski's 'The football war' for a vastly superior and more intelligent treatment. 
 This is the worst sociology book I have ever read, a complete disservice to the stuggle for women's equality and an embarrassment to the university which trained its author and to the press which published it. I was one of the subjects interviewed by the author. Her methods are flawed: she failed to interview both men and women working for the same institution, rather than simply in the same profession, making everything the men told her about their jobs worthless as scientific data. Her analysis is suspect: she didn't publish the full text of her interviews, but simply selected statements, leaving the reader no way to fairly judge the context or overall tone of the subjects, or judge whether these quoted responses were typical or unusual. Her conclusions are laughable: she found that men either seek promotion or do not. Men seek promotion in order to dominate and control women;  men decline promotion because they secretly despise the women they work with. It's too bad such an interesting and important subject could not be dealt with in a scientific way 
 This book repeats a few of the strategies presented in "The E-Myth Revisted", trying to point them at the contractor. Unfortunately, except for a couple of good ideas from that book, there is nothing here but fluff and pep talk.  At one point, I think you can actually tell where material was cut-and-pasted from the sister book about medical practices, where they accidentally forgot to change "practice" to "contracting business".   If you found some chapters of the "The E-Myth Revisted" to be a bit fluffy for you, you can count on an entire (although short) book of it here. Very dissapointing and not particularly useful. 
 I bought one of these because I thought it would make it easier to brew fresh ground coffee.  The beans are ground in a chamber with screen walls and then the coffee is brewed by dripping water right through the grinding chamber.  This works surprisingly well and is easy to clean since you can remove the grinding chamber and rinse it out in the sink.  The problem I had is that the the bottom and sides of the brewing chamber are all mesh so water ran through the beans to quickly making a weak cup of coffee.  Adding more coffee produced stronger coffee but it wasn't as full-flavored as a cup brewed through a paper filter in a standard coffee maker.  I ended ditching this product and going back to a standard coffee maker and a stand alone grinder.  If you like the complex flavors of a strong cup of coffee you'll probably end up doing the same 
 As a student of an Ivy League Institution, I thought that Wertheim's "man-bashing" was inappropriate and unfounded.  Her interpretation of historical facts were deceptive and misleading.  She  twisted these facts in conniving ways to support her feminist thesis 
 Almost immediately after I received this never-used pen, I noticed that the ink does not dispense evenly.  Often, it does not write on any surface.  After I scratch the pen tip wildly for ~5 seconds, it starts to write again.  I've thrown it away because it is too inconvenient for use.  However, it is very cheap, so maybe it's okay for someone who doesn't need to use a tiny pen too often 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 This thing worked fine for about 6 months, I used it mainly for grilling steaks, pork and chicken.  But once the cord starts to come loose from the probe it's time to chuck this piece of junk in the trash. I'm shopping for a wireless thermo now.  
 There isn't anything in this book that you won't find in Warren Buffett's annual letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (available for free at the Berkshire Hathaway website).  If you've not read those letters then I suggest you get right to it - they clearly lay out Mr Buffett's approach to investing and are written in a very easy to read, humorous and homely style.  This book pulls many of the highlights from those letters together in one place and lays out some major tenets and themes that could be said to make an investment "Buffett like".    If you're not familiar with Warren Buffett and have not read his letters to the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway - then you will likely find this to be a good introduction to Buffett.  Anybody else should probably steer clear as there isn't anything new here. 
 I've read great reviews about this book so I finally bought it because I could not get it at my local library. Never ever finished the book - it was god-awful. Badly written, incoherent story - it jumped around - JUST PLAIN BAD.. 
 It lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it.  Now the bad!  The pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy.  Mine is warn to the point that my 20 month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it.  First he takes the tray off (also very easy for him) and then he pulls the back off.  At that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing.  Don't plan on it lasting through more than one child 
 Ridiculous, laughable! Written by a patriarchial mentality. If a man wants to know what a woman thinks or wants, then a man must ask a woman. No man understands women! The only woman who could be 'explained' by this nonsense is one who's been brainwashed by patriarchial idelolgy, and there are quite a few of that type in America (and in Saudi Arabia, and in Afghanistan, and ....).   For a book that does explain women, to both women and men, see Simon de Beauvoir's 'The Second Sex'. Excellent text, I've read and reread it many times, with greeat benefit. 
 Normally, I find it hard to put a Sue Grafton book down once I get started. Not the case with "S". I did not enjoy the plot about Violet and her abusive husand.  The main character Violet was too much of a stereotype - boobs, red hair, just a boozing slut over all.  I didn't get the whole thing about her brother and why he disliked her. The ending wasn't clear either. I did like the development of the relationships with the young girls exposing jealousy and how it ruined relationships over several decades. Most of the characters just weren't that interesting overall.  I missed her interactions with Rosie the restaurant owner and her neighbor, the handsome 80 year old baker Henry. Usually, there is an interesting man in the picture too - not here.  I would vote pass on this one. 
 I have a little trouble sometimes maintaining a conversation, and small talk really isn't my forte.  I don't ordinarily buy self-help books, but I read the reviews of this one and I thought I'd give it a try.  Well, the good news is that apparently I'm much more socially capable than I'd thought.  The bad news, for me, is that this book has little to offer to anyone capable of even the most banal responses in social situations.  Say, for example, that someone comes up to you at a party and happens to mention that they've just returned from France.  Would you (a) ask what airline they took and whether they enjoyed the flight, (b) ask what parts of France they'd visited, (c) offer observations based on your own experience in France, (d) ask the person how, as an American, he or she was received in France given the recent international tensions between the two countries, or (e) offer up any one of a thousand other innocuous responses?  According to Garner, you should ask the person "how did you manage to get hotel rooms over there?" or "in what way was the food there different from what we have here?"  Well, you can probably imagine how much further the conversation is fated to go once your interlocutor realizes that he/she is talking to a complete ditz: "Well, I called and made a reservation."  "It's, uh, French food."  I can see these suggestions being of some help if your only other alternative was to stammer out some unintelligible response, or to say, "Ooh la la," or some such thing.  Such examples are rife throughout the book, leading me to believe that it could only possibly help the most socially inept among us.  Honestly, I'm not trying to be mean-spirited, and I can see how this book _might_ help someone who simply cannot think of a single thing to say.  But even in that regard, Garner advances theories and then cuts them short without developing them.  About five times I turned the page, expecting to continue reading whatever mildly interesting thesis Garner had put forth, only to find that the chapter had ended!  The book is basically a powerpoint presentation for nerds.  You're better off just having a little confidence in your own abilities 
 This monitor didn't work for us at all! We heard a lot of static, and the alarm would go off too. It wouldn't work anywhere in my livingroom or kitchen.  The alarm was always going off. 
 The author's approach is natural and meditative but lacks a step-by-step strategy.  For those looking for steps to recovery, I suggest reading the book, Alcoholics Anonymous.  This is THE founding text from which all other  12-step recovery programs began.  Believe me, a recovering alcoholic, I  found the SOLUTION in the 12-steps and with other recovering people.  It  saved millions of lives as well as my own 
 This is one of the worst (maybe the worst) books I have ever read. The actual investing technique the author used is explained in less than half a page at the end of the book. The rest of the book is just piles of completely useless and irrelevant stories about the authors travel and adventures that have absolutely nothing to do with his technique or investing. The author and the publisher are insulting the intelligence of readers by publishing such a stupid book.   The technique explained at the end of the book is one of the most basic techniques in Technical Analysis (TA). In the TA terminology, it is called support and resistance levels. If you are interested in this technique, use one of the books on TA. Those books cover it in much more rigor than Darvas' book and they cover a lot more TA techniques that are much more powerful. My favorite book on TA is "How Technical Analysis Works" by Bruce Kamich.    Husam Abu-Haimed, Ph.D.   
 I picked up this book because I didn't think the LOST novels were anything more than a rumor, and didn't realize "Endangered Species" was the first one.  At any rate, "Secret Identity" is a big time waster if you're a rabid LOST fan looking for an interesting show based book.  Dexter Cross essentially is nothing short of an annoying character that has no interesting back story, and most of the time on the island is devoted to him obsessively mulling over whether he should take a look in the fuselage for Daisy or not or passing out from dehydration, while his backstory is nothing more than a drawn out story of how he lied to his girlfriend of what he really was.  Big deal.  You have no emotional attachment to the character, and worse yet, the writer forgets to actually describe him!  I kept picturing a 30 something year old character that was more akin to looking like Artz than the young man who "didn't quite look like Boone and was probably a little younger".  Worse yet, the writer was overly descriptive to the point of exhaustion; I don't need to know precisely all the graphical designs on the box for the grills that fell on his cranky aunt.  This woman needs to stop writing, because she obviously can't 
 This book purports to be a Dictionary of American political slang but should be entitled "Washington D.C." political slang.  To test out the book, I looked up some commonly used Chicago political slang terms.  None of them appeared in the book.  Had the author bothered to look outside the Beltway, he could have found words like "chinaman" (a political sponsor/source of clout) and "fetcher" (a legislative bill proposed solely for the purpose of generating campaign contributions from an affected industry) 
 I purchases this Gazebo and I thought it was a quality product, and found out after I erected it that it is made very cheap...The canvas looses color in about 2 months and the tie down clips for the top starts to rust and the elastic will stretch soon after....                                              Now when the wind hits the top it flaps and no longer is stable...             then the hold down clips one by one breaks off now the canvas top is at the mercy of the wind. I lost my canvas top one night and it riped off and destroyed the frame...to make a long story short..THIS PRODUCT IS JUNK AND DON'T THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON IT.....To make matters worse I contacted the manufactor and was told that they were no replacement parts avalable.... 
 Don't waste your time with this dreck. go get Dan Zevin's "The Day I Turned Uncool: Confessions of a Reluctant Grown-up.&quot 
    I was really looking forward to this book when I ordered it. It seemed like an interesting peice of litreture. However, I found the writing in it really childish, and I also found myself trying to decipher the odd spellings and grammar in the book.  At the end of the book, I was left wondering what the moral, lesson, or message was. The only thing I really picked up was that it was "okay to be gay", and even that theme didn't shine through strongly. I really felt this book lacked conclusion, as well as a theme.  Though, I do not doubt that this book is fairly true to life... 
 I have no problem with anyone liking this film, but I thought that Cyborg was absolutely godawful.  This is a direct quote from my Video/DVD Guide (by Mick Martin and Marsha Porter): "A study in bad.  Bad script.  Bad acting.  Bad directing.  Bad special effects."  In my opinion, I'm afraid that the quote resonates with truth.  In this film, which is easily the worst action movie I've ever seen, Jean-Claude Van Damme seeks vengeance against the gang that killed his family.  There's also something about a "cure," or something, but not much attention is focused on the plot so I'm afraid I can't inform you of this part of the story.  Although this film has never been on MST3K, it has all the elements to be on that very Sci-Fi program (extremely low-budget sets, wooden acting, etc.).  I think that the only aspect of this film that may appeal to viewers is the martial arts, however I've seen much better martial arts sequences in other films, particularly Enter the Dragon with Bruce Lee.  From the laughably campy to the tediously tawdry, I've seen my share of bad films (Razzies that stick out in my mind include Indecent Proposal, Death to Smoochy, and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen).  However, Cyborg plunges new depths of badness 
 This was a very ordinary spy novel. Nothing outstanding and nothing that suspensful. Way too many coincidences and not enough reality such as a LeCarre or Deigton would have.. If this book were a movie it would be classified as "B".....  This is the first Littel book that I've read. Some reviews stated that Littel was in the genre of the great spy masters. Based on that info I purchased this one and one called The Company... Well, in the lexicon of Howard Cossell; " Fugetaboutit"!! He is a long, long way from the Masters .. 
 While it was probably a great deal of work, this author has done little more than regurgitate what is already written in the Cluetrain Manifesto, Customer Relations Management 101, and downloaded from sites on the net.  I found very little that was new or enlightening in this tome.   I was hoping for some new and invigorating concepts in marketing...but it's not here.   
 "Con Express" has lots of action in it, which is great because this hides the poor writing and uninteresting characters. Unfortunately, the action isn't enough, and in between stunt pieces and shoot-outs, the audience is tempted to doze off. City Heat Productions isn't really known for producing films of the highest quality, so usually I go easy on them. If this were a big-budget company producing this, I'd be inclined to pan it entirely. But I wasn't expecting much and got a little more than I bargained for. The action is, for the most part, pretty good but nothing competitive with your usual dumb action movie. Flanery and Vosloo are perfectly casted, but everyone else seems to stiff to add any more flow to the movie. Vosloo especially appears to be enjoying himself as an over-the-top bad guy hijacking a train containing deadly chemicals. The film moves fast and contains shades of better movies like Under Siege 2, Con Air, Spy Game, and Speed. If you liked those, you probably won't mind this one too much. Just go easy on it 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 "Histoire de Marie et Julien" is the most solemn movie I have seen in years. It comes complete with heavy-handed symbolism, characters who are wallowing in existential anomie, and all manner of pretentious ambitions. But worst of all, it is devoid of any shred of humor or wit.   What remains? The "mystery" of the tale? Those viewers who find themselves still conscious at the end should have little trouble figuring it out. Rest assured that I take no pleasure in slagging this film; I'd just hate to see anyone waste their time and money on it. 
 It seems only to have occurred to a few of these reviewers that whatever Foucault intended as the poltical upshot of Discipline and Punish (and are we even 'allowed' to ask such a question?) its practical political effect has been to allow senior academics a face-saving way to warn graduate students not to rock the boat while denying any authoritarian tendencies.  Perhpas Foucault's work has somehow had more positive political effects in gay rights work, and I would be interested in hearing that argument, but I doubt it.  I think his celebrity has done that 
 this book was boring.  Evrything in here was either stuff you could look up in the dictonary and that you wouldn't need to because the terms went by other words as well, or common sense that you would know by guessing.  This book reads similar to books made in the era of black and white television whos goals were to dispense facts and not to entertain thus saving space and money.  Because of this it sounds just like an instruction manual except for the fact that most instruction manuals arent this long.  If you plan on reading this book all the way through good luck its a 282 page instruction manual. If I could have I would have given it a negative one star review 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 OK, I'm a SciFi fan.  I read the SciFi reviews and thought this was really a movie for me, and it really was good right up to the end.  Just one problem, they forgot to write the end.  What happened?  Did they run out of money?  Did the writer write himself into a corner?  There was no climax, conclusion, or resolution.  You can argue till you are blue in the face about "pan & scan."  I prefer movies with an ending.  If you are looking for a great unfinished story, this one is for you 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 I am disappointed because this is a really flimsy toy. The launch button doesn't push most of the time (so Superman doesn't launch) and the foam Superman tears easily. 
 This book makes some decent statements. However, Korten goes way overboard on his assault, and in doing so ends up "throwing the baby out with the bath water".  What I wish Korten would write is "WARNING - if we are not careful, corporations and the short term goals that they inspire CAN and WILL ruin not only the planet, but your life and life as we know it". But so will any organization that is left unchecked (think of 1984 and/or Brave New World for excessive examples of both). Korten warns that corporations have the potential to be excessive in their quest for greed, and that is true. However, corporations are made of people, and if people decide to give their lives over to greed, then yes, there will be consequences. Korten never really says this, but it is obvious -- life is more than just work, and it is every person's individual responsibility to think about the values of life beyond just simple greed. This means (I think) sharing a healthy passion for improving your position economically in life, but also balancing it with other equally important needs - love, family, friends, environmental balance, love for your neighbor (regardless of territorial boundaries), etc...  Korten's attack on corporations is excessive and looks at the worst case scenario in every sense, and then finds a way to place the blame on business. He tells you about all the people that he has seen misplaced over the years due to terrible economic corporate greed. However, is it just corporations that are at fault here, or could it also be politicians, local police, warlords, lack of execution, or any other things that could have made a situation bad. Korten decides that it is the fault of corporations and leaves it at that.  Korten also likes to talk about all of the failures of capitalist societies and how evil greed and pro business leaders caused all of this pain. I agree with him that there is no government in the world that is perfect, and the US (the leader of corporate society) has many skeletons in the closet of history, but the US history is also one of constant improvement, relentlessly seeking to improve the balance between companies, individuals, and the different elements that make up all of life. The "Robber Barons" was a chapter of US history that was excessive, but it was also one that was ultimately fixed (or balanced), and after this was done the US not only emerged as one of the strongest economic powers, but also a place that immigrants loaded onto boats by the thousands to come to. And yes, this was a CHOICE that they made - no corporation forced them to come.  Korten (as well as the first review of this book) goes into talking about how even Adam Smith was opposed to large corporations. To quote, (page 81) "Smith... opposed any form of economic concentration on the ground that it distorts the market's natural ability to establish a price that provides a fair return on land, labor, and capital". This is incorrect. What Smith opposed was any economic force that led to COLLUSION or MANIPULATION of the markets away from their free workings. Today free market principles are espoused and they should be. When they are not, and often times they are not, we are dependent on the courts and our elected officials to rectify the problem. Sometimes this works and sometimes it does not, but simply saying that corporations are bad (and Adam Smith says so too) is just wrong. Free market capitalism is a work in progress...  I could go on, but I will give one last example of Korten's excess. On page 76, he talks about the beliefs of free market ideologues. He writes "These beliefs are based on a number of explicit, underlying assumptions... (1) Humans are motivated by self interest, which is expressed primarily through the quest for financial gain. (2) The action that yields the greatest financial return to the individual or firm yields the most benefit to society. (3) Competitive behavior is more rational for the individual that cooperative behavior and ultimately more beneficial for society. (4) Human progress and improvements in well-being are best measured by increases in the aggregate market value of economic input."  OK, fair enough - this seems to be a fair statement in general. However, Kurton then puts his EXPERT OPINION on things to work. He then interprets all of this in the next paragraph when he says "To put it in harsher language, these idealogical doctrines assume that: (1) People are by nature motivated only by greed. (2) The drive to acquire is the highest expression of what it means to be human. (3) The relentless pursuit of greed and acquisition lead to socially optimal outcomes. (4) The interests of human societies are best served by encouraging, honoring, and rewarding the above values." This jump to "harsher langauge" is absurd.  Reading this, I just cannot see how Korten is looking at this with any sort of objective lens. To reinterpret the first set of thoughts into the second is just a ridiculous leap and assumes that all people in large corporations must be Gordon Geckos. This type of comparison is made time and time again in this book and is the reason I don't think his arguments can truly hold much weight other that one off examples of corporate ills.  In the end, Korten does have some points. If you, or society, or the world, cannot understand the difference between economic growth and happiness/quality of life, then we are all in trouble. However, I give the world more credit than that. It is not a perfect world to say the least, but just because there are some problems in certain areas, we should not be totally against that area. While throwing out the bathwater of economic growth and improving qualities of life, let's make sure to hold on to the baby that we are trying to take care of 
 I don't understand how anyone who chose his dog over his wife and daughter can be extolle 
 I love the music on this soundtrack but very diappointed because it can not be downloaded into my ipod.  The same thing happened when I tried to download another CD of "The Little Mermaid".  At that time I thought it was the fault of the disc which is why I purchased another.  My computer will download other CDs so it is not at fault.  Perhaps Disney has installed some sort of chip to prevent downloads.  Anyhow, I had to go to Apple Music store and pay $0.99 per track to have this CD.  Instead of costing me $13.99 it has cost me $33.79  I would love to return this CD but since the seal has been broken I am out of luck. Hope this helps other ipod users so they don't have the same disappoinment as I did 
 I was expecting this to be a book about the monastic experience, but instead, it is a book mostly about Kathleen Norris, her life, and her social theories. There are a few nuggets of wisdom sprinkled here and there, but not enough to justify reading all the surrounding dross. Worse, there is no humility in the book at all.   Instead of being a seeker of wisdom who went into religion and then wrote about her experience, Norris seems to be merely a writer with a gimmick of hanging out with monks and nuns to get a good book idea. If you like that sort of thing, you may like this book, but you should know what you're getting before you buy it.  There is a hard edge to Norris's writing, an underlying anger and vulgarity. For example: "[N]ow we sigh, discouraged, hearing only the seeds of our well-worn, ludicrous sexual double standard which dictates that women must be either virgins or whores, either blessed or cursed, while men are simply sexual athletes." And: "That we all begin inside a woman and must emerge from her body is something that the male theologians of the world's religions have yet to forgive us for."   She uses the f-word, apparently just to shock readers and listeners, as when she notes with self-congratulatory satisfaction that after one such use her driver appeared startled because "[S]he apparently had heard that I was a religious writer." Well, regrettably, I had heard that, too.   There is far too little introspection in this book. Norris too easily criticizes others while failing to look at herself and while rationalizing her own behavior. Perhaps I have been spoiled by reading Henri Nouwen, who seemed to always analyze the nature of his own feelings instead of criticizing someone else who may have brought those feelings about. But then again, Nouwen was a person of admirable humility, a quality Norris needs to work hard to develop.  Norris has plenty of personal issues to deal with, as do we all. This book would have been much better if she had spent more time honestly wrestling with these issues instead of commenting on externals, offering social criticism and justifying her life as "a poet. 
 The teory written by Mr. Maxwell Maltz sounds very interesting: if you can control your mind the you can do anything you want with your life. Wow, what a book!  The question you never asqued yourself:  What if instead of working so hard everyday on changing   "myself" and " my life" through the mind, what happens if we throw away all that stressing stuff and simply starting to live. That is the treasure of the no-mind. The treasure of your heart.   If you are one of the people who think this is an incredible book, i bet you think all the time in your so called "life" and believe that you will someday be a great person with a lot of possesions, money and relationships. Please be careful, Once you become aware of the mind as an ilusion, you see all these bunch of desires as simple ilusions, that have to fed day to day for the rest of your life with no final retribution, this is why this is called the meditation of suffering, the meditation for what you dont have, the meditation for what never will fulfill you. I invite you to stop seeking through your mind and begin too see how wonderful life is, When there is no more "me" to feed with the mind its false illusions, then you will discover true freedom, and a bliss you never could imagine, the joy of being.  Instead of this book i recomend you "A diamond in your pocket" by Gangaji or "A New Earth: Awakening to your life purpose" by Eckhart Tolle, these books will help you to Awaken from your mind and find out who is the real You, the one that has been covered with false illusions and thoughts since a long time, the one that's ready to be discovered 
 I love "The number one detective agency" series, and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales.  Unfortunately there was no narrative flow, making the stories stilted and un-interesting.  Maybe a narrative explaining the lessons would have helped.  I suggest this book only for those interested in collecting african fable 
 On the surface, John Waters has it all -- a loving wife, a beautiful child, a successful business -- but appearances are deceiving. His marriage is in trouble, his business is under investigation by a federal agency, and his business partner has made questionable financial decisions which jeopardize everyone's future. Into this mix wanders Eve Sumner, a stunningly attractive woman who makes it abundantly obvious she's chosen Waters as her next conquest. However, appearances are again deceiving, because Eve Sumner claims she is actually Mallory Chandler, Waters' first great love.  Funny thing, though: Mallory Chandler died ten years previously.  So who is this woman? And how does she know things only Mallory should know?  In an effort to discover the truth, Waters finds himself involved in an affair that quickly turns dangerous, as Eve/Mallory displays the same obsessive behavior that destroyed Waters' love for Mallory twenty years before.  This novel requires a major suspension of disbelief for its critical plot device: transmigration of a soul. Once the reader accepts that, however, the story moves along quickly and works well within its preposterous premise. Waters flails and fumbles and does his best to fix the mess he's made by getting involved with Eve/Mallory, even as she seems to be setting him up for a murder charge. His desperation and fear are palpable, and certainly mitigate his at times wrong-headed choices. I truly enjoyed this story, that is, until I read the final pages.  The final plot twist, which I won't reveal here, is so farfetched, even within the confines of a plot that stretches suspension of disbelief to its outermost limit, as to spoil all the good trashiness that preceded it. I read the last few pages and threw the book across the room. I felt cheated. I think Mr. Iles wrote himself into a corner and couldn't think of any other way to give the reader a happy ending. Gah.  Never have I been so disappointed with a novel's resolution.  Oh, and the frequent references to a novel written by a character within this novel which happens to have the same title as a novel written by Iles bugged me too.  Gah.  Oh. Go ahead and read the story. Just rewrite the ending in your own head. I did 
 If this is your first Barbara Taylor Bradford book, you may never pick up another one.  I, on the other hand, like to give an author the three strikes rule, so won't hesitate to try something else, but it won't be very soon.  If you want to read one of her novels, do NOT start with this one like I did.  This is very boring--like snails serving as soap stars--not to mention slow and predictable.  I listened to the entire thing on cd, but think it was mostly because I liked Ms. O'Karma's narration--she has an appealingly smokey voice like Carolyn Jones from the Adams Family.  It still couldn't save this story with its endless self-serving "what-about-ME!" mantras and Valentine's overly moralistic attitude.  I'm the same way, and I bore myself!  You knew from page one where this story was going, and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper.  "I was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me" resounds every other page, yet she wants to get away from all of that.  Nothing's worse than a character or real person who brags, then turns around and screams "Look at me, look at me...How DARE you look at me?!"  
 mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks  
 This was the movie that gave us The Brat Pack, a staple of a certain 80s cultural set.  The term Brat Pack was derived from an article writen by a journalist out one night with most of the men starring in St. Elmo's Fire on a boozy night of partying.  Since then the gals in the movie as well as a few others who weren't in the movie (Anthony Michael Hall, for example) suffered a bit of a ripple effect.  Here we will see all of them at their prime and at their peak of heart throb success on every teenage girl's bedroom wall.  Out of all the dramedies of the John Hughes movies, this was the one I liked the least.  Maybe it was the fact that all the characters were so vain and self centered.  Maybe it was the fact that it was all so idealized seeing all of them trying to adjust to their lives after graduating college.  It was trying to be the next generation "Graduate" movie, and I didn't relate when my time came.  Maybe it had to do with the fact that I have been let down by many people and didn't have that network of friends in similar situations, and the isolation I felt during that first year adjusting to the outside world having left the nest of academia.  I guess I was just a little more bitter.  Plus, as my life was surrounded by work and little else, I didn't have all the dramas going on they did.  That was kind of sad, the one scene where Rob Lowe goes back to his old frat house and they tell him they need someone like him to couch their team.  It proves you really can't go home again and there are some clinging to the past.  Not to mention embarrassing with that one gal who has managed to hold onto her virginity for so long and in one of the attempts to releive her of it Rob Lowe finds those enormous granny panties.    This caputed more of a time in fashion and music than it did a mindset.  It's not a bad story, but the vain and self centered antics of the main characters left me cold.    
 The PCI bus does not have the bandwidth to get you Gigabit speed.  You will be very lucky if you can get 300 megabit speeds on a PCI gigabit card, even with jumbo frames.  Your motherboard has two PCI busses, and sometimes has three.  Depending on the chipset and the manufacturer, the internal devices like the keyboard/mouse/floppy, internal network, USB, Firewire, and more, will be on one bus or the other bus and often both busses.  You will have to run SiSoft Sandra or pcitweak to figure out which of the devices are on which bus and experiment with which slot to plug this card into so the card can get all the PCI bandwidth it can get, but that will not be close to gigabit speed, either.  Best case on 33 MHz PCI is 300 megabit.  Even if you can find which PCI bus has the fewest bandwidth-consuming devices on it, the 33 MHz PCI busses in all consumer PCs cannot handle the bandwidth of this (or any) gigabit card, anyway.  If you want true gigabit speed get a motherboard that has built-in gigabit or get a motherboard with 66 MHz PCI, PCI-X (not PCI Express), 64-bit PCI, or similar, but you're going to pay lots of money for that.  Worse yet that built-in Gigabit interface might still be on a 33 MHz PCI bus and always sharing bandwith, giving you less than 300 megabit speed.  It probably shares with other devices so you have to do your homework 
 Better skip the reader's reviews and try another book. This one is far worse than it's rated there. I tried it for what I believed it would entertain me, but it did not 
 Anne Tyler is no doubt a good writer. The literary quality of this book is very good. But putting that aside, this book was so depressing I wanted to kill myself when I was done with it. I wanted things to be fixed, for them to work out so badly and it seemed so many times that she was hinting that they would be, and instead I felt incredibly let-down. Don't get me wrong - I don't always need a happy ending but this book could have really used one. I wasn't particularly fond of the way the author jumped decades with each chapter either. I had to continuously take a step back and say "Wait - where am I in this story again? What era are we in now?"   I thoroughly enjoyed this book until I realized that my happy ending was not going to take place, but the writing is strong enough that I cried actual tears over how it worked out. If you prefer stories with happy endings, or are maybe involved in a difficult marriage or relationship yourself, I suggest you stay away from this book because it will only make you feel worse about yourself. I'm sure those with great relationships read this and thought "Wow, I'm so glad we're not like these people."  If you are, however, on the more difficult side of things - I suggest you read "The Wedding" by Nicholas Sparks instead. Those of us traveling along bumpy roads need hope, not the sense that we are merely "amateurs. 
 This movie is my favorite movie. Ever. I feel terrible giving it two stars. But it gets 2 stars because I am comparing it to the Rhino version, which I also own. I also own the original VHS. I have watched this movie at least once a year since I was 8 except for about 6 years in middle school/HS. I can sit in class and watch it from memory in my head.  BUY THE RHINO VERSION.  If you can't find the Rhino version, this isn't half bad. Its just that that version is much better, and since I have been growing up with older copies, the new one's flaws, minor to the newcomer, are blinding to me. I also am physically unable to watch any of the "Special Edition" Star Wars because of those changes, if that gives a clue to my movie anality.  BUY THE RHINO VERSION IF YOU CAN FIND IT.  One complaint is that the VHS had this cool "glitter" effect in a couple of scenes involving energon and Unicron internals. It is present in the VHS, It came out wrong in the Rhino version, and was totally gone in the 20th. Thanks for deleting part of my childhood.  In comparison to the Rhino version:   The remaster is terrible. Mine seems to flicker and have strange artifacts. The colors are totally off. Hot Rod is basically magenta/pink instead of red and his orange is not orange like an orange, it is orange like a cheaply made basketball.  Widescreen is fake. It is a cut fullscreen. I wish you weren't such a liar, Sony.  Cover art: D-. No detail. Looks like whoever does the new show drew it in an afternoon or two. The matrix looks like a honeydew. It would have got an F but Prime is on there.  Very few of the extras were worth it. I bought this for the remaster, hoping for some clean up and a restoration of the glitter effect, and they weren't there 
 Ian McEwan's small comedy is about as engaging and carefully constructed as the campfire song.  The humor is thin, forced, and entirely dependent on schadenfreude.  The plot follows the mutual self-destruction of two members of the British intellectual class, an accidental editor and a pre-modern composer.  But really the demise of any of the other characters - all equally conventional, egotistical, and empty-headed - would be equally entertaining.  Fortunately, the book is short and the vocabulary is shallow, so the reading experience is mercifully quick 
 Extremely lengthy, considering that it takes 250 pages to get to the "crime", and nothing of importance is revealed after reading 500+ pages. Too many major deviations from the spacer/settler universe,  including appeal to deus ex machina type plot devices. Asimov would have  hurled. Given all that, I will probably end up reading the next book, if  only to finish answering the questions left hanging. If you haven't started  reading Vol 1 yet, don't 
 As an engineer who both uses hydrogen and can work the math, I'm astonished that no one has corrected Peavey.  He mixes units, get equations wrong and just plain can't spell.  A decelerating engine is  "braking" not "breaking", for example.  His  thermodynamic computations are often wrong once you work them out, his  "borrowing" of other sources is painful where "propane"  was not changed to "hydrogen" is all cases in a paragraph.   Incredible.  This text is very nearly the "Anarchist's Cookbook"  of renewable energy -- there's a lot of words, some of it correct, but  someone's going to get badly hurt if they actually follow this guide.  All  that, and a decade out of date to boot. If Amazon would take the book back,  I'd gladly send them the ashes from the woodstove 
 It took me almost a year of off-and-on reading to finish this book. In most stories, there is at least one character that you can identify with - even if it isn't the author's intended goal. In this book, they are all pathetic losers on a fast track to Nowhere Land. To call this a monumental work is laughable. The story moves like sludge until the very end, then becomes simply forgettable. If you enjoy being abused with other people's dysfunctions, go for it. Otherwise, don't bother 
 this bratz looks very pretty but she is fianna she shound  not have blond hair she shound have brown because i have  funk out fianna wild life safari fianna and flash back fever fianna and they all have brown hair 
 I found this documentary left out some information about the Bush family that I thought would be included. The documentary did not cover George W. Bush's grandfather's working relationship with the Nazi party during the second world war. Nor did the doc spend much time on the rest of George's relatives and family members. The doc didn't include as much information as I thought that it would and the material that it covered has already been covered in other documentaries like Fahrenheit 9/11. The host of the documentary had to assert his fedora for no reason which was more distracting and annoying to see in what I expected to be a hard hitting, serious documentary 
 Basically, the authors discuss a number of breakout and/or reversal strategies that are pretty well standard fare; I didn't see any 'breakthrough' ideas involving volume as I'd hoped for, save the usual accumulation/distribution stuff that can be found in any common technical analysis book. A few important points emerged, such as the idea that dumb money usually causes more violent accumulation spikes whereas smart money accumulates more quietly. Not really a revelation. Perhaps the main problem with the book is that it's simply overwritten and not written very well. Lacing almost every trading 'lesson' are personal accounts of the authors'---how he began trading, mistakes he's made, etc. Kind of reads like a diary and not a grammatically sound diary at that. If you were to trim all of the personal narratives, admonitions and pontifications about trader psychology personal or otherwise, you could rewrite this book in about 30 or 40 pages at a price less than half of what this one costs. Better yet, a book simply of charts with do's and don't would be far more meaningful because there is so much clutter and ineffectual writing here that it obfuscates what the author is really trying to say. The authors' foreign nationality certainly doesn't help, as he tries to sound colloquially American and it just doesn't come off right. If you're new to trading I'd look elsewhere. If you want to skim some charts and pick up a few points on breakout strategies and volume that you may not know about, I'd first look through this book in the bookstore before shelling out thirty or so bucks. 
 "Blood Dolls" is a confounding freakfest about which little of worth can be said... It begins with a quite literal indictment of corporate ethics as a pair of unscrupulous complicitors in an unethical business enterprise enter the world of a business "genius" who wears a long-discarded X-Files prop (literally copied from the episode "Grotesque") as a mask, has a morose clown for a butler, and keeps a dwarf around for no apparent reason other than to keep the general sideshow aura amped to an extreme level. This dwarf routinely tortures his encaged, all-female rock band, who, beside being surprisingly technically adept, do little more than provide nudity. Shortly into the proceedings, the cornball bloodletting starts, the billionaire reveals the disproportionately small head beneath the mask, and one of the complicitous nobodies is transformed into a "blood doll." These must be parodies of "Puppet Master," but since that film might as well have been a parody itself, that isn't saying much. The film exudes an air of sadism amid the camp, and occassionally meanders into utterly senseless philosophical musings culled pretty much directly from the sources they cite. The acting is awful; the characters and story, absurd. However, it's also pretty damn funny, in an Ed Wood-let's take this seriously even as it becomes increasingly absurd to-kind of way. Worth a rent for a camp conoisseur, but little else 
 For any number of reasons I can probably say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I understand that a lot of people think this is genius. I am not one of them. Personally, I don't find endless descriptions of sex with minority boys to be very entertaining reading, let alone genius. I also don't find pointless prose that appears to have no discernable thread of thought to have much value. Personally, I like to read good story tellers, authors like Tom Robbins or Salman Rushdie. Naked Lunch is about as opposed to them as you can reasonably get.  This is one of those books that sounds a lot better when someone translates it for you. In reading the preface where Norman Mailer talks about it in the context of the court proceedings in the 1960s, the book sounds interesting and culturally pertinent. However, upon reading it the book falls far short of the lofty status we get from Mailer's answers on the stand. I understand how Alan Ginsberg, a proclaimed NAMBLA member, would find it's material suitable. I wonder about Mailer though. While I'll never take a stand against a person's writing what they want, I do take pause when someone recommends something like this.  This is not literature so much as a heroin clouded view of the author's own serious problems and his interpretation of our culture's deficiencies. The notion that this is the "naked" truth, or lunch as it is so called, is so absurd that the book should never have been accepted as remotely resembling cult literature, in the past, present, or future. Who reads this and resonates with it? Who thinks, "Yes, gay sex with boys is what my mind is all about? Oh, and all the better that they're Arabs!" Very few people, the author included. Burroughs himself admits this was difficult to write. This is probably due to the fact that the vignettes portrayed here do not, in fact, represent anything so much as the anarchy resplendent in the author's own mind while he struggled with various addictions. As a case study in heroin and morphine addiction, this may have some merit. As a counterculture commentary on society I find it worthless.  This isn't about my sensibilities being assaulted - far from it. If I can read & enjoy Robbins's linguistic forays into sex with nuns, I can handle just about anything. I'm not offended with flying sperm so much as I am insulted that anyone felt this was worth reading; that I was lured into thinking this was a work of art. It's not.   Sometimes I read books that don't suit me, but I understand why someone would like it. This book falls squarely in the camp where people feel they need to proclaim it genius because they're so confused or intimidated by it. This book is far from genius. The author admits it was put together from scraps of things written while he was in his heavy heroin addiction, and that he vaguely remembers much of it. I don't see how, or in what context, this book will appeal to anyone other than a case study of a certain segment of people at a certain instance in time in America 
  Dr. Grandin has had an impressive career, going from Brooklyn College to Yale to a teaching position at NYU in record time, and already publishing three books in the process. Of course, bashing Conservatives is the staple of Latin Americanists, and is not exactly controversial behavior at NYU. One wonders how tolerant Dr. Grandin would be of a graduate student who wanted to write a dissertation on the thousands of Cuban troops deployed to Angola, where they fought under the command of a Soviet general. We might also ask our erudite scholar for research tips on Venezuala's purchase of hundreds of AMX 30 tanks from France - of course, President Chavez needs them to protect himself from the U.S., not to crush a rebellion or invade a neighboring country. Sorry, Dr. Grandin, but playing the antiimperialist intellectual in academia is not exactly heroic behavior. 
 I gave them a chance.  I read the hype about how this album is so momentus and amazing.  I bought it. I listened to it.  Over and over. Sorry, I just don't think it's very good.  In fact, I would say this is incredibly over-rated, self-indulgent, pap.  Ok, so life is dark and hard and sad and black and... you get the idea..  there are dark albums, Springsteen's "Nebraska" for example - that speak not only to the harshness of life, but give a hint of fighting back, of a spark of soul rebelling even as it sits on the electric chair.. and there are dark albums that are angry, like Eminem's "The Marshall Mathers LP", where the music and lyrics are as violent as the life they portray.  "Closer" is completely lacking any of the soul or vitality evident in these works however, and from the start of "Atrocity Exhibition" to "Decades", this is an album that accomplishes nothing but staring at its own belly button. Oh, and the fact that lead singer Ian Curtis committed suicide doesn't make it tragic - it makes it pathetic 
 Dwyer wants to impose his answers to religious questions* on other people's children.....This is wrong when theists do it to the children of secularists.....It is just as wrong when secularists do it to the children  of God lovers. . . . . . . . . . . . * for instance, How did we get here?  What is our purpose 
 Worked well with matching N1 router for about 3 days.  Then I had to uninstall/re-install the hardware (tech support recommendation).  I did this a few times before exchanging it.  Same problem.  The PCI card doesn't fit right.  The antennae connectors are too loose. Also, I was having to reboot constantly.  Once removed, system is more stable.  Do not purchase this first version of this adapter card.  I will try the USB version when it comes out 
 Don't waste your time or money. This was an okay book in its day (though it has zero content about altimeters) but that day is long past. The new edition of the Land Navigation Handbook covers the basics equally well and also educates on altimeters, digital mapping, and GPS. 
 The Book Description provided by Amazon.com above says, "Kenan B. Osborne ... identifies which doctrines of the church are "immutable truths" that must be concisely taught. Then, he discusses statements which are currently the official teachings of the church, but which may change in time, Finally, he describes those areas in sacramental teaching which are still being discussed and argued by reputable Catholic theologians."  This description alone should raise red flags among any catechist who is a faithful Catholic, for the official sacramental teachings of the church will not change over time.  This is why the Church is apostolic; she does not change her teaching, but rather, it remains the same in every generation as the Church grows in her understanding of the Faith.  Let me give an example of Osborne's heterodoxy.  Osborne states that these are issues we face today:  Is Baptism a remedy for sin or a celebration for grace Baptism and the equality of all Christians The indissolubility of the sacramental marriage  Any catechist who has read the Catechism of the Catholic Church (2nd ed., 1997) knows very well that these three "issues" brought up by Osborne are not "issues" at all.  They are teachings of the Catholic Church that will not change, even if a theologically liberal Franciscan Friar thinks and publishes otherwise.  Stay away from this text.  It is part of the reason that Catholic catechesis in the United States is in its current poor condition 
 Having to read this book for a Mysticism class I was appalled at the irresponsible and totally inacurate information slanderously thrown together.  This book pastes Dionisus into any form utilizing kindergarden techniques.  The author claims to have spoken with Dr. C. G. Jung, but his lack of knowledge suggests strongly that he has only glanced at Jung's collected works.  Ecstacy is an insult to any educated person in the ways of psychology, religion, pagan philosophies, inner spirituality and growth.  Personally, it should be removed from all bookstores and book outlets as it is a pathetic excuse for writing.  In short, do not read this book 
 As far as I am concerned, '8 Minutes in the Morning to a Flat Belly' was a total waste of my money.  I've been following this workout and eating plan for over four months now and have seen no reduction in neither my belly size nor my weight.  Frankly, I was seeing more results from my old Denise Austin Low Impact Aerobic Workout tape than this, so it looks like I'm saying goodbye to Jorge and going back to Denise.  Sorry Jorge, I gave it my best shot but your plan just doesn't work for me 
 I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley's a great hero.  This movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.  Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement.  This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair. 
 Richard Fawkes' writing is stilted, his phrases repetitive, and he doesn't convince me at all that he knows anything about the military. Don't waste your time or money 
 As per the review, I decided to buy the item. I received it. It was very thick and ugly looking. It just looks good in the picture. As mentioned by someone, it has plastic back cover which makes it worse. It also is very large and long. So to remove the small braces cost more. Overall unhappy and returned to AMAZON with loss of money in shipping 
 This review is for Universal, not Quantum Leap which I give 5 stars for with or without the original music.  My issue is this: I too have had problems with DVD-18s made by Universal, most notably 'Casino' & 'Schindler's List'... the kicker is that the stores will not refund the movie because of copyright laws... they tell you to get another one which freeze and skip also. So due to these problems and Universal's refusal to spend an extra few cents to make another disc(for Ray, Blues Brothers, Cinderella Man, Schindler's List, American Gothic, QL, etc infinity), I am BOYCOTTING Universal DVDs. Warner Bros. stopped making doubled sided disc with 'E.R.' & 'West Wing', why can't Universe-smell do the same thing? simple: MONEY. PROFIT. Send them a message, folks. Because this will be the only way they will listen. I shouldn't have to wonder if a movie is gonna play right when I buy it... simply pathetic. And this is not even getting into the music copyright problems with 'Quantum Leap', which I quit buying cos of the double sided disc. Universal suck. I hope they are reading this. more info at video business dot com 
 I'm stunned.  Every once and a while a movie comes along that is so deeply in love with itself AND so deeply flawed that you are left sitting there in slack jawed disbelief.  This is one of those movies.  Pretentious and "look-at-me-I'm-so-quirky" yet so remarkably inane and trite.       To be fair, the movie is not technically bad, and in more capable hands could have been something really special and "meaningful".  Instead, however, the incessant self-absorption, the cliches that pass for "wit", and the smugness all just combined to make me (right around the ten minute mark) root for tragedy to strike:  "Oh, large truck in the background, please, please drive into the foreground, swerve, and hit a character...any character."  And don't even get me started on the first year film student level dialog that ends up squeezing every ounce of well-intentioned meaning out of this lemon so that there's none actually there.    This is a vanity project and it shows.   Miranda July wrote, directed and starred in this - so we pretty much know who to blame.  And to read that Miranda July is a performance artist - well, that pretty much explains everything right there 
 the on-the-rock marriage scenes are pathetic, making this already lukewarm and loose thriller become even worse. from the very beginning, this female washington reporter knew what mitch rapp did for a living, yet she continuously whined, intervened, demanded, complained, pried into her husband jobs and duties. what is this? trying to make rapp look more humanly realistic, making him look more like the stereotyped american husband? making us enable to enter rapp's bedroom, wathching 'war of the roses'? come on, this is a thriller, not jackie collins or danielle steele's 'honey, no sex tonight'. get rid of the nagging wife pronto! also, this novel is not up to the standard of a good thriller. a story falling apart in many ways 
 I was hoping the book would be good.  most reviews are.  However the topics are not really covered at all, more introduced.  It was like talking to a drunk bloke about sports, most points are important and relevant but its presented in a way that makes it confusing.  They openly admit they dont want the book to be rated on the quality of the english.  Just as well, long rambling thaughts that don't form conclusions.  Not what I wanted or needed.  It actually manages to take the fun out of reading and texas holdem all in one go 
 I am a HUGE fan of Olay products and use their foaming face wash, moisturizers (including the Regenerist Continuous Night Recovery is a great product)... so I was really dissapointed to spend $16+ on this product and then see no change.  I am in my 30's, have fair/medium shade combination skin.  I tried using it on various types of spots from a beauty mark to a break-out spot that was healing.  I tried using it a couple of times a day, at first blending it in and then even leaving a dollop on the marks while I slept (not blending it into my skin).  I tried it for several weeks.  No results.  This product did nothing for me.  I would not recommend it.  I would have given it zero start, but Amazon does not allow it.    Avon has a product out that touts similar claims to Olay's product.  I have not tried it yet but would suggest you see if you can try a sample of that from an Avon rep. instead. 
 After we used and liked the phone for two weeks the handset developed severe static.  When we contacted Philips' customer support they agreed it was a defective handset and gave us an address to which we could return the handset for repair or replacement.  Our poatal service record of receipt indicates they received it on October 21, 2006.  For more than two months we made numerous phone calls, spoke to many different persons, and were promised callbacks that never came.  Finally a "supervisor" assured us that a handset was "in the mail."  That was more than three weeks ago.  We plan to keep trying to get some satisfaction, but meanwhile we have lost any shred of confidence we ever had in this manufacturer. 
 Having read a few Bosch books already (The Closers and Lost Light), I realized that I should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how Bosch became the Bosch I was reading in the later series.  However, I was very disappointed with this book.  One of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such).  I found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before I stopped reading)!  I thought it was ironic that Connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book.  Also, I found the book to be too gritty.  It lacked the emotion and soul that I found in the later books.  It seemed that Connelly was trying too hard to make Bosch fit this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that I read.  So it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because I just finished reading The Narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some other Bosch books and just read it out of order.  Connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better, which should explain why I didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it.  I gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe I was too impatient.  This is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order 
 I am a teacher at an inner-city school that struggles with the same issues presented by Kozol.  That said, this is the fourth of Kozol's works that I have read, and I came away just as disappointed with "The Shame of the Nation" as I did with the rest of them.  I am so incredibly sick of him shouting from the mountaintops that there is a problem with public education.  He acts like we don't already know.  He acts like there is some unseen solution out there that should be obvious to everybody.  Instead of pointing fingers and and complaining about it, why doesn't he use his experience and know-it-all knowledge to offer real, concrete and practical solutions?  Kozol is a classic Monday-morning quarterback pointing out the flaws in what everybody else is doing - but he doesn't get his hands dirty anymore.  If he is really as educationally omnipresent as he thinks he is, the least he could do is offer some solutions.  I've made four mistakes.  I will not make a fifth.  I have 150 underpriveleged kids to teach, and I can't afford to waste my time on another volume of complaints while he points out the obvious 
 If you want a dry outline of the Roman Empire from village to Empire, followed by a rather cursory treatment of Rome's collapse, this book is for you.  This book is also for you if have sleeping issues, and is the kind of book that made me hate history and the liberal arts when I was a smug physics major.  This tome is also filled with far too many spelling typos.  Alex Alaniz  1. Please see the reviews of my own strong science fiction book: Beyond Future Shock about the near-terms perils and promise of advanced bio/nano technology in a world still roiled with Middle Age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients.  2. I have REVIEWED many books from undergraduate to graduate in: PHYSICS, MATH, ECONOMETRICS, and HISTORY among other areas 
 This book is based mainly on here say not much input from keith.Christopher Sandford seems to be spicing up the actual events as i have read conflicting biographies, if you believe everything you read then apparently most of the stones are gay and Brian Jones was a braindead stoner who new little about writing songs and only wanted to be a pop star...............................................absolute BOLLOCK 
 I'm writing this for my seven year old grandaughter --she loves this DVD- she twirls and bounces and dances all the way thru it -- it transports her to an imaginary stage where she is the star-- I love watching her enjoy this dvd!! 
 ustedes me dijeron que no tenian el libro,.¿que comentario quieren de lago que no me enviaron 
 First, let me say I wanted to love this book. The first O'brien book I read was The Things They Carried, a masterpeice. I suggest to all who were turned off by July July to please read this before writing him off. He has enormous talent, but this book didn't show any of it. The characters are barely credible. The setting of the reunion seems as if the characters dropped into a twilight zone scenario: they can and do haunt the Darton Hall campus in the wee hours, no buildings are locked, no security guards are ushering them out of the door, as if the campus is a ghost town, a mere prop waitng empty for thirty years instead of a real place with a whole new set of students. The dialogue of most characters not only sounds the same, but has the same style in that many scenes end with a character emitting what is meant to be a clever quip. On a more positive note, the sub-tales are mostly quite good, such as David Todd's tale in 'nam (I loved Johnny Ever, the most interesting character in the book), the tale of the lover who drowns (reminded me of a story by Richard Ford), and most of all Marv's tale. Tim, if you are reading this don't be discouraged. I know you have some better stuff in you. Maybe you got a little lazy or contrived on this one. Best of luck on your next effort 
 Although vivid, most of the essays in this book are far too short to address the complexities of each different personality.  Beschloss's essay is the best; Morris', Caro's, and McCullough's good but inferior to their  respective biographies of Reagan, Johnson and Truman.  Goodwin's essay  doesn't add much, and the editors get docked a star by choosing Benjamin  Bradlee - of all people - to review Richard Nixon.  A more impartial person  and Nixon biographer (Stephen Ambrose?  Tom Wicker?) would have been more  appropriate.  I think you are better off simply getting the biographies of  Reagan, LBJ, Truman, and Clinton by Morris, Caro, McCullough, and Maraniss,  respectively 
 Unfortunately, I must agree with B. Brazy. I've read all of Jo Beverley's Regency and Georgian titles and she is a superb writer. First, the premise that Mara (who has known Dare all her life) suddenly decides she's in love with him strains all believability. Then, she decides she'll be the one to rescue him from himself like he's some sort of project. Oh, by the way, overnight, Dare decides he's in love with her, too. Why? I didn't find Mara spunky, I found her incredibly silly, and annoying.   Dare's struggle with his addition would have been such a strong story if he'd had a strong, mature heoine by his side, and if the Eastern element of the plot involving Feng Ruyuan and and mysterious Mr. Salter had been fully developed. What could have been an intense, moving, incredible love story was treated with the fluff of the light-hearted romps so prevalent in Regencies these days. 
 I knew Ihad made a mistake in ordering this book when I read in the forward that it was for women who relexed their hair. This book is for those women who want to keep fighting with the damage that relaxing the hair can bring in order to have long, healthy looking hair. It can be done. I wore a relaxer for years and when I got serious about taking good care of my hair, it grew to about nipple length (pardon my French) from top of shoulder length in about a year and a half. But that process was expensive and kept me from working out (for a healthy body) for fear of screwing up my hair's progress and shampoo cycle. In September 2005, I decided to transition my hair and opt for a more natural course of care...Plus I really needed to do some heavy working out and my relxed hair was holding me back.  So, if you're looking a book on natural hair products and/or natural hair care for afro-textured (wavy, curly, kinky, thick, medium, fine, short, long or anywhere in between) this book is not for you. For my beauties out there still on the relaxed and un-natural train, from what I have read so far, you may reep value from this read.  Just be on the look out. This author is really into chemical hair products and recommends using petroleum-based hair pomades, protein hair gels, silicone-based, and mineral oil based products 
 This book is published by the organization which also produces the NA Bird field guide considered "best" by most avid birders, the National Geographic Field Guide (Geo guide for short).  However it is absolutely NOTHING like said field guide!  It is very small (6 inches by 4 inches) and consists entirely of full page color photographs on the left page, and brief descriptive text with a Texas-only range map on the right page.  At the bottom of the text page are even more brief notes, usually about another similar bird, and often accompanied by a tiny painting of that bird (which appears to be taken directly from the Geo Guide).  The photographs are quite good, and really are the only saving grace of the entire book.  They appear to be chosen for their artistic value more so than to illustrate field marks, however.  The selection of species is extremely superficial - for example, the only species of oriole shown is Bullock's Oriole, despite the fact that in west Texas Scott's Oriole is routinely found, and for birders in the lower Rio Grande valley the target species is likely to be Altamira Oriole (not pictured), or, if coverage was as exceptional as I had hoped an NGS bird publication would be, even Audubon's or Black-vented Oriole - and one also wonders why Orchard Oriole, found throughout the state, is left out!  The book description here on Amazon is "generous" in its pronouncements.  The "guidance on where to look for key birds" consists of a one-page, incredibly simplistic commentary on birding in Texas ("The Texas coast is well-known as a place for migrant birds to rest and feed on their way northward."  "Other regions of the state include the High Plains where Lesser Prairie-Chickens still strut . . .")  Turn the page and the most specific location data provided is a map of the entire state with numerous parks and refuges depicted.  But it is left entirely up to you to figure out how to navigate to Anahuac NWR to look for those migrants (where's High Island?), and, since Lesser Prairie-Chicken isn't even included in the main text, how are you supposed to know that Muleshoe NWR might be a place to try to see them?  My greatest hope for this book was that it would give additional insight into the Texas specialities of ABA area birding, but even here it is basically incomplete.  Plain Chachalaca, Least Grebe, White-tailed Hawk, Crested Caracara, Common Paraque, Buff-bellied Hummingbird, Ringed Kingfisher, Great Kiskadee, Black-capped Vireo, Green Jay, Colima and Golden-cheeked Warbler, and Olive Sparrow are all here, but missing are a few regular species which make Texas birding so unique, such as Groove-billed Ani and White-collared Seedeater.  Since only in south Texas can a Muscovy Duck be counted (as opposed to being labelled an escapee from you local park's pond), why not show a wild Muscovy instead of another photo of a wild Mallard?  And what about every birder's favorite dump denizen, the Tamaulipas Crow?  Overall this book is not recommended, at any level of birding, for any use other than its collection of photographs.  For a beginner in the field (or even in the backyard) it doesn't provide the necessary comparison images to differentiate even the most obvious field marks so as to allow identification.  For the intermediate birder trying to locate target species in Texas, the guidance (or essential lack thereof) to places where the birds can be found is woeful.  And for advanced birders - well, they really don't need something this small in size or detail.  Be aware that there are several other titles in this series, for other states, and I suspect that this review's basic criticisms hold for all of them.  As for me, I'll hold on until November when the Fifth Edition of the REAL Geo Guide comes out 
 I love ethereal, ambient, healing New Age.  I have at least 250 CDs of this genre in my collection.  This will not be #251.  Do you remember the electronic piano/casio electric keyboard sound of Mr. Roger's Neighborhood?  It is in most of the songs on this album.  The few songs that don't have this are decent, but if you want truly healing, contemplative music, try Liquid Mind, Anugama, Raphael or others like them 
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 This review is for the Spanish edition ONLY which I recently purchased (ISBN:8498160162, publisher: Linkgua).  Note, that this is an ABRIDGED EDITION (edición abreviada) and is not true to the original text, this is evident commencing with the first sentence of the book. The reader will get the general idea of the novel, but will not read the words as written be the author.  I submit here an example of the above-mentioned sentence:  ABRIDGED EDITION (ISBN 8498160162): A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido vulgarmente con el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que era el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en los demás arrabales y hasta dentro de la ciudad.  ORIGINAL TEXT: A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido popularmente bajo el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que, sin embargo de haberlo anunciado aquella tarde tan sólo, contra su costumbre, era ya el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en otros arrabales y hasta en Intramuros.  This editing is consistent throughout every paragraph in the book.   If you just want a good read, then this edition will suffice. It is an excellent novel. However, if you are an admirer of the Spanish language, please get your hands on the original version.  
 This book was as much the author's opinion and imagination as anything else. He makes claims that are not substiantiated by facts, biblical or otherwise. I will not purchase further books by this author 
 I tried. I really tried to finish this book. It sounded so promising and the beginning was a page turner. At page 166, I gave up. I am the type of person who will sit through a horrible movie and likewise,  continue to read, until the end, a terrible book if only to tie up loose ends. I blame myself for not having the sado-masochistic tendencies needed to read this book in its entirety.  
 I knew when I purchased these sheets for only 13 dollars they weren't going to be great, but really these are ridiculous.  They are incredibly  thin sheets and they pill easily.  They also do not stay on my mattress, I am constantly having to put them back on.  I will not purchase these sheets again 
 I came across McCarry after reading Mark Steyn's claim that he was another real ex-spook novelist and better than LeCarre.  Well, lots of things are better than recent LeCarre, but at least to judge by this book McCarry is a journeyman writer who doesn't come close to comparing to LeCarre in his prime.    Yes, his intelligence background lends surface realism to his descriptions of a hunt from one end of the world to the other-- the part set in a remote corner of China where Kafka meets Genghis Khan is especially convincing and amusing.  But too much of this covers standard airport novel stuff-- the old (by now very old) Nazi in South America, the way-too-much-to-swallow-mystery (which covers all the ground from ancient Judea to Osama bin Laden-- by way of Heydrich's Czechoslovakia!), the band of retirees assembled to solve it all who fall somewhere between Doc Savage's Fantastic Five and one of those aging-actor-work-program movies like The Wild Geese.  The real point is that McCarry is telling a plot-- a whopper of one-- and can only tell it by sending his main character from one part of the world to the next where, conveniently, someone who we are told will tell him nothing promptly tells him everything.  LeCarre, on the other hand, uses the dilemmas of spying to explore character.  The mystery in Tinker, Tailor could hardly be smaller (one's a mole, which one is it?) yet it's vitally involving.  The mystery in Old Boys could hardly be bigger yet it's-- oh, that old thing again.  Whatever 
 If you want bad gourmet recipes, then this is your book. The basic information is poor at best, and the "fancy" gourmet recipes are not even good. When I begin to cook a meal, i'll look in the "joy of cooking", get disappointed, and go and find what I want on the internet. The recipes are what you would expect to eat in the early 20th century. This book should have stayed there. I'm sure your grandma loves it though! squid in ink sauce?! for real? c'mon 
 Reads like the written English homework of a particularly pretentious eighth grader. Skip it. 
 90 % of what we see on this DVD has been released on DVD in the last few years. Again a Tina Turner release where EMI/Capitol takes absolutely no effort to give fans something rare and extra. After the disappointing "Simply the best" DVD, they manage to screw it up again.  
 Hello to all those who have read this book.  After reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something.  WHy are you so set against God and Christianity?  One of you said this book was what made him rejest Christianity.  Christianity is not some weird religion,  it is the faith that Jesus Christ died for all humans, who He loves so much.  Where are you going after you die?  Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life.  The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired.  There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it.  there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true.  So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ.  I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word.  If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible.  The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity.  PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble.  Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him.  Thank you 
 This is one of those "it's so bad it's not good but passes as funny".  The one note jokes about Dolly's you know whats promote groans, but the guys will like them.  But, I discovered Richard Farnsworth!  What a handsome older man with piercing blue eyes!  Sadly, he's passed away since, but I've really enjoyed his performance in other movies like "Misery".  Enjoy 
 Somewhat disappointing - too general.  I probably will not ever open it again 
 Toy makes EXTREMELY loud animal noises, along with a screeching motor when backing up or at top speed going forward.  My son enjoyed the heck out of it for about 2 minutes before my wife said it was going back to the store, which is exactly what I was thinking.  At least 3-4x louder than any other toy i've ever seen, let alone purchased.  Also when performing its "flip" maneuver, it gets stuck 70% of the time and then makes the same screeching motor sound while it repeatedly tries to reset its "flip arm".  Might be okay for just outside use if you can stand a lot of high pitched noise.  Controller was extremely toddler friendly compared to other RC toys.  Toy also seemed fairly tough. 
 Bad bad bad.  I'm not sure exactly what is wrong with these discs, whether it is flimsy material or an asymmetrical center but they are not reliable.  I purchased a 50 spindle and from the first 28 used only one worked properly.  This is an expensive waste.  I suggest going with better quality discs at the outset.  It will save on headache later 
 I had water rockets like this when I was a kid in the early 1970s.  The rockets were no different from the ones that come in this package.  They shoot high and straight and are loads of fun.  My only gripe is with the pump.    When I was a kid, the pump was heavy plastic and metal.  The pump on these new rockets is cheap plastic.  The knob on the end broke off the first or second day.  My son and I are still able to shoot the rockets, but we have to carefully stick the knob back on each time we want to pump up a rocket.  
 My wife and I do a lot of volunteering catering for the local elementary school.  We also direct our school PTA's hospitality services.  That requires large amounts of food prep on a monthly basis for all the events requiring food.  This Rival slicer was relatively cheap and did a good first job, making quick work on items that need to be sliced thin.  It's good for the less skilled cooks out there who aren't skilled with a knife, as well as for even good chefs that need to do large volume tasks with common items like luncheon meat, ham, or other cold cuts.  But it's certainly no commercial Hobart slicer, and it won't produce the same quality of results.  The blade is quickly dulled if attempting to slice a semi-frozen roast to produce thin raw beef for say, Philly Cheese Steak or for Vietnamese Noodles.  Also, the design catches meat underneath which festers unless you disassemble the entire under carriage and remove the gunk underneath and disenfect.  I debated whether to give this product 2 or 3 stars, and while it does come in handy for occasional home use, I'm experienced with a knife and have decent knives and professional sharpening equipment.  In the time it takes to break this out and slice and do the clean up, I can out-produce this by hand about 2:1.  But that still would warrant 3 stars in my book, but I had to lower the rating to 1-star because of the residue and trapped meat and sinews that the undercarriage causes.  I don't know who designed it, but being a very highly trained in mechanical engineering, this seems like classic idiotic American slap-together design and get it out in the low-end marketplace to stupid comsumers who don't know any better.  Rival is basically asking for a lawsuit, not because people will cut themselves in this case, but because the undercarriage traps stuff and to remove it, you really have to remove components that aren't user serviceable and even then, it's still hard to clean.  Ever since the first use, I've diligently disassembled the under carriage, exposing some electrical wiring, and cleaned out the residue left by the slicing process.  And yes, the gears are plastic as another reviewer noticed.  If you use your slicer often, the blade dulls quickly, and the motor will work harder and this will damage the gears sooner.  What happens if you're less mechanically inclined and don't clean the slicer like I do?  Well, we had only one ant problem last summer in the house and it was because they found the mostly cleaned slicer boxed and placed on a rack, then found the residue and proceeded to invite a million sister ants to come in and feast on it.  Try as we might to disassemble and clean it, more residue kept coming out and the ants would not relent and kept attacking the slicer.  I ended up doing a nearly full disassembly and submersive cleaning of the slicer components (except for motor) and to repackage the slicer in knew plastic with Windex spray on the exterior of the box to neutralize the formic acid of the ants.  As a scientist, engineer and volunteer cook, I'd recommend that people stay away from this product, unless they like to disassemble the whole thing and then spend an hour wiping and disenfecting the thing after each use.  
 Despite the fact that this item is described as a "set", and the picture shows stones on the board, this board comes with no stones.  When my board arrived, the top of the board had rubbed against the cardboard box enough to partially wear away the grid on the board, at least to the point where the item is unsuitable as a gift 
 It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.    Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.  Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.  Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.  
 I read this book long time ago and it reads like a dictionary. He takes the subject and does not attempt to help you in this HUGE industry. It is like reading 10 dictionaries of French, without actually taking a real lesson. If you like to learn trading look for Toby Crabel's articles or Linda Raschke. They are professional money managers and traders. Not authors.Not self promotors.Last,Jim Rodgers told a conference that John does not trade actively and does not have a record of outperforming the markets 
 This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????  Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.    Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.    The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.   
   It has come to our attention that copies of LINGER and FOR WELLINGTON purported to have been signed by Viggo Mortensen without personal dedications have been offered and sold on E-Bay. We warn any potential buyers of these books that Mr. Mortensen has not signed any books without dedicating them to a specific person, institution, or charity. These signatures are forgeries. We regret that some people have been deceived and paid far more than the actual listed price of these books, believing them to have been signed by Mr. Mortensen.  Source:Perceval Press, Viggo Mortensen's publishing house posted this warning. (www.Percevalpress.com)  This is not meant to indict the sellers in the Amazon links. Rather it is to offer a warning to anyone that has equal concerns as to how these books can be this expensive when they were less than 50$ when they were sold through Perceval.   Then again, perhaps gougers think if people will buy a grilled cheese because someone claims the Virgin is toasty somewhere in the bread, for over 20 thousand dollars, any fool will pay anything just to say THEY own it.    Caveat Emptor indeed.  
 At first you think that this book is going to give you insight into the stardard language as spoken in Britain, Australia, and so on. There is a lot on diversity but we never quite get to the practical side of things and it is all left a bit unclear. What I needed was a straightforward guide for my work, when I travel on business, so I avoid misunderstandings and get the language right when I talk. It would be really helpful if this author could write a book with a description of the standard language for each country and vocabulary lists for the most usual words. You could then look across. I am going to Australia, then I say this, I am going to Britain, then I say this, and so on 
 This book depends upon (count'em) five works from the nineteenth century, all of which have been debunked by scholars. It is a wonderful fantasy. If you like reading fantasy, and can accept it as such, it will be a great book for one to read.   However, ask yourself what has happened to Hal Lindsey in the last 36 years: he made a fortune, now owns several homes and luxury cars. Strange way, don't you think, for one to show his belief that the end is near 
 I think Bizzy had no idea that this film or movie, or whatever you want to call it, was being made or released.  Don't get me wrong, the songs are good, but the layout of the movie is just not worth the money.  Unless you are a big time Bizzy Bone fan, this movie is not for you.  
 Why would anyone bother to read this when there is the lonely planet guide available? This is in my opinion a vastly inferior guide when compared not just to lonely planet but to many of the others available, it lacks  organisation and detail 
 This new monograph has been released to coincide with the Whitney's retrospective.  Both the long over due retrospective and the new monograph are lacking in quantity and depth needed in doing justice to  this  amazingly prolific and important artist.  Abrams' previous Neel  monograph  had many more images and excerpts of  important interviews with Neel   throughout the book (provided by the forsight of Patricia  Hills.)  The new  book, under the Whitney museums' auspice, includes interviews with some of  the sitters.  While these anecdotes are interesting it doesn't make up for  the total superiority of the 1983 monograph (reprinted in 1995.)  If you  can find a used version of the previous monograph, you would be wise to  aquire it.  I also recommend Pamela Allara's "Pictures of People,  Alice Neel's American Portrait Gallery"  which puts Neel's work in a  cultural context (from the depression through the feminist movement. 
 The symphonies are capable of compelling one's emotions from the depth of tragic despair to the pinnacle of majestic triumph.  Karajan's interpretation leaves one with the overall sense of being drowned in a bowl of oatmeal.  The size of the Philharmoniker doesn't make up for their lack of enthusiasm or  of clean articulation.  Instead of reaching out and grabbing ones attention and enthralling them with its sheer genius, this interpretation is more a sedative, dulling the senses with its insipid blurriness.  
 There are so many better books on the market and this is quite frankly unimpressive. If Schiffman is a good salesman he does not demonstrate it. I had phone interaction with him once and found him to be obnoxious. The only good thing about this book is that it doesn't cost much 
 What is the fun in reading about 3 very inmature and stereotyped  characters?  The book starts as "Sex and the cityï¿½" at a yacht in the Mediterranean. The difference is that the main characters are male. Quiet entertaining in the first 20 pages. After that you can skip to the last chapters and  these succesful "teenagers" with the bodies and money of adults found the women that will change their lives for ever. Ha! And of all them will find true love at the same time! Ha! Botttom line: bad novel from a very commercial writer  
 I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now 
 I have used Lonely Planet Guides in the past and have been pleased with the information they provided.  This iteration, however, leaves much to be desired.  I use the guides to point out the "obvious" places that should not be missed, and "secret" places that are off the beaten path that the writers share with their readers.  I found this book lacking in both instances.  Vacations are never long enough, and as such, they require research and a seasoned guide to separate the worthwhile sights from the rest.  After reading this guide, I was not much better off than before I started.  Further, I found the guide is written for a backpacker mentality; fine for them, but not for me.  Way too much time and space was devoted to finding one's way via public transport, and where to find the next hostel. I am well beyond that.  I recently received the latest Fodor's and Frommer guides for Austria, and in one chapter, I was miles ahead with either guide over where LP left me.  LP was extremely helpful for my travels to Australia and Belgium.  This edition was rather disappointing 
 Its great for that 1 day - makes potty training so exciting and fun.  And definitely can see the appeal for kids who have negative views on potty training.  BUT what about after??  The books barely talks about how to reinforce it, how to phase out treats and stickers, how to get them to tell you when they need to go as opposed to telling htem when they need to go.    Also - its an EXPENSIVE way to potty train for sure!!  So this book is good... but get another one one how to maintain potty training after 
 Sorry for the sarcasm, but I can't help thinking just how uninspired this book is.  Imagine a counter to this book.  This book would promote "hate", "dishonesty", "immorality", "ignorance, "ingratitude".... you get the picture.  This Mormon leader's great contribution to world is to say we should be honest?  Now that was profound!  Sadly, Gordo and his wrinkled cadre have this bad habit of taking the basic decency of the members of the church and attributing it to the implausible myths they peddle to the world.   As an avowed atheist, I encourage everyone to be honest, moral, learned, and all the things Gordo promotes in this book.  There is nothing wrong with promoting these and they have nothing to do with Mormonism.  But this book is written for children and sheep.  Promoting this book among the various books that seriously discuss morality, ethics and other serious issues is like watching a high school team play the New England Patriots or comparing a Janice Kapp Perry vapid song to Bach's Mass in B minor.    Mormonism is declining in real terms because their leadership does not have the capacity to address and provide any illumination to the relevant issues of the 21st century.  This book should confine itself to the children's section or to the local Deseret Book store.   
 This was expected. A fanatic relativist dismembers absolutist views into little irrelevant pieces. Our civilization has been jumping between absolutism/universalism and relativism ever since its decline, with only a few people realizing a third alternative. With this whole book based on a flawed definition, it is a pointless and utterly tedious read 
 Although easy to load a smart card, this viewer was disappointing in quality.  My pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although I found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual).  The manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. If not going through the bother of returning it through Amazon because I purchased it on line, I would not have kept it.  I actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise I would have given it only one star.  I could have purchased a unit a Circuit City or BestBuy and been better off 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit?  For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up 
 plain and simple i'm 32 years old and been dianosed with HBP since 15 years old. I'm on three medication for HBP. I order this then i wait for it to come. i jjust happen to go to the doctor today, he takes my pressure and tells me its 113/100. when i arrive home one hour later, the device is waiting for me. i plug it up and it tells me my pressure is 101/75. Sending the unit back 
 I will admit that Paula is inspirational BUT she doesn't give you enough time to "learn" the move before putting you in full gear. I loved the music and Paula's upbeat personality but felt it moved way too fast. This video will definitely get your heart a pumpin' 
 I loved the original book "The Sherbrooke Bride".  I have read all of the bride books and this is by far the worse.  The only reason I have given this book two stars is because it lets us know what has become of our favorite characters.  Otherwise, this book is a complete waste of time.  If you want to be thoroughly entertained I suggest reading the first book which happens to be about Alex and Douglass.  Skip the second for Ryder's story is so-so.  I would then read Sinjun's search for love.  It is very funny and captivating.  Ms. Coulter generally writes really good books.  She should have quit while she was ahead 
 I found this book to be rather dull although I did learn a lot about fox hunting. The description was fabulous but I don't think that it was much of a mystery. I kept reading but I also kept wondering when something was actually going to happen. I did love the character of "Sister" 
 If you are looking for love, romance, witty banter and everything else that has made Suzanne Brockmann a hit....don't expect it from this book!!  The romance is undeveloped, sparse and stale.  The suspense is based on gore and the end is abrupt.  A great read if you're looking for nightmares.  
 Joel Osteen almost never mentions the word "sin."  He's so popular because he tells people what they want to hear.  As for the book, it's garbage.  He says to stop thinking only about yourself and start thinking about others.  But the whole book is about thinking about yourself.  He says that you should be happy with what you do have rather than what you don't have.  But the entire book focuses on getting what you don't have.  He says Christians can get what they want by just visualizing and saying that they will get those things.  Does anyone other than Osteen actually believe that?  What about Christians who live in Rwanda, San Salvador and other poverty-stricken parts of the world?  Or does that way of thinking only apply in affluent societies?  He says Christians deserve special treatment.  But try acting that way at work or at a store and see how much others like you for it.  Don't read this book 
 My "tween" daughter loves these Saucony Jazz shoes. They are comfortable and stylish. This is her 3rd pair. I'm glad that I found them online. They are both old-school and stylish 
 Yes, this cookbook is beautiful and a welcome addition to growing library of books associated with the Church's liturgical year. BUT the recipes are deeply flawed. It's obvious that the author did not really test the recipes--for example, the sesame/anise bread for St. Joseph's Day calls for 4 cups flour, 6 eggs, 2 cups water, and 1/2 cup of melted shortening. Anyone who knows how to cook would know instantly that you will not end up with a kneadable dough with those quantities but rather a form of library paste. So beware if you try to cook from this book 
 We recommend not buying this game, unless you don't mind a buggy version that is not supported by Hasbro and can't be fixed.  Hasbro has decided not to support the game and the patches at the website are no longer available.  Save your money and wait for the next one, hopefully bug free 
 Chelsea Quinn Yarbro has spent two decades giving us windows to distant times and forgotten lands through the eyes of the vampires Saint-Germain and Olivia and often done an extraordinary job.  This is not the case.  Reading Midnight Harvest one wonders if she even bothered to make research this time.  Saint-Germain has to flee Spain to escape the Fascists.  As if they would have bothered a rich, Catholic nobleman.  Yarbro seems to fall pray to the easy conceit many fall pray to and believe the Fascists were bad and the Republicans were good.  She goes on and on about the "Generals" stealing business and killing the owners.  Not one word about radical Communists and Anarquist doing it ten times worse.  Saint-Germain's struggle with the White Legion in California and a Fascist assassin is a study in boredom.     My greatest problem with the book is that it makes me doubt the accuracy of Yarbro's research for other books.  Dark of the Sun was astonishing(in a good way). But if all her research is so inaccurate.. 
 Sviatoslav Richter brings his superb technique and penetrating musical intelligence to bear on the WTC and the result may not please scholars but it is deeply enjoyable (which is probably what Bach had in mind).  Unfortunately the sound on these recordings is abominable.  After listening for more than a couple of minutes I give up.  I think it is the fault of the original recording in an over reverberant acoustic but there is a constant "aura" which really gets in the way.  There is a far better and consistently more exciting version recorded in Innsbruck in the early 70s but it is only available in a CD version on "Polo" which is published in China.  Presumably RCA Victor has problems with the dissemination of this version in the West!  It's not a perfect recording by any means but it is far more listenable.  
 This book was suggested reading as if " THE GREAT SECRET to PERSONAL FREEDOM" was going to be revealed. It spoke of a self-centered mindset that seemed to suggest that I was to live my life how I wanted and not consider how my actions would affect others around me. A very simplistic and selfish point of view 
 Crying of Lot 49 Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning.  Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness Poor Plot Poor Writing  Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy. Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)   
 This book has to be one of the worst books I have ever read on the subject of Biblical history. I had to skip pages, then  a few chapters. The author keeps making the same petty arguments over and over, chapter after chapter. If you are looking for a piece of scholarly  work, you might want to look some where else, perhaps, "101 myths of the Bible." This book neither dissuades  the fundamentalist nor gives reasonable skeptic any new piece of information; it's just the author, - "trying" to use humor and endless sarcasm to formulate her theories. Perhaps, it would have been helpful for the author to demonstrate when and why these collection of writing became the foundation for most societies of the western world. If I took away one thing from this book this might be it: "...the bible is the most available, most purchased , and least read book in the wold." That said, no one needs this book, what one need is to actually read all the books of the bible(not paragraph and verses) with some healthy skepticism 
 In the Long Ago Far Away, I remember reading some of the Anita Blake series, but being no fan of mysteries or detectives I let the series fall by the wayside.  If a writer is truly great, then I can stay rivited even if the subject isn't one of my favorites.  I adore Faeries, to the point of practicing a post-modern version of Faerie Faith with no rules and no boundaries (and hence no obsessive traditionalism).  Ms. Hamilton now has fairies with no rules and no boundaries.  None.  Zip.  Nada.  Yet somehow, this is the inverse of liberating.  Oh, I am not surprised.  I have something of a fetish for well-written negative reviews, and reading some of the erudite, articulate attacks on Ms. Hamilton's writing have been illuminating.  I am fully aware of the direction taken by Anita Blake and I knew to expect it with Meredith Gentry.  So essentially, mixed blood fairy girl (1/2 Unseelie, 1/4 Seelie Brownie, 1/4 mortal - or some approximation of that mess) without the immortality gene runs away to escape torture at the hands of the Queen of the Unseelie Court, her Aunt Andais.  She becomes a private investigator in Los Angeles.  Auntie sends a few of her bodyguards to retrieve the wayward Princess Meredith and bring her back to the Court, where the Queen will make Merry an Offer She Can't Refuse.  Part and parcel with this offer comes the requirement to have sex with the Queen's Guards until she conceives, because a child will guarantee Merry the Throne.  Merry's competing with her cousin, Cel, who is under the same orders to produce a child.  And that's about it.  From some of the reviews here, I expected a lot more sex.  There are a few near misses and a few actual sex scenes, but they're nothing special.  The kink quotient is quite mild, comparatively speaking.  Even the scene that involves tentacles peters out to nothing.  It seems that, if the character is unattractive or undersirable in any way, Meredith will be spared sex with this fiend at the last minute, in the most contrived way possible.  Merry, apparently, doesn't take any for the team.  The most diffecult thing about reading Laurell Hamilton is the way she writes.  Her vocabulary seems very limited and the writing is quite repetitious.  Whenever someone bites/something stabs Meredith, the pain is described as "sharp and immediate."    "Burning and instantaneous" "Terrible and abrupt" "Stinging and urgent"  I'm not even trying.  Along with this limited vocabulary, Ms. Hamilton writes very much in passive voice.  Is, was, were, has, had, be, been, etc.  Dialogue is also stilted and awkward, with normal diction sometimes ignored to give a character an opportunity to say something "witty."  Characterization isn't a strong suit either.  Meredith is a little dull, but most heroines are.  Her sex partners all have nearly identical personalities, and I wish there had been some variety in the way Ms. Hamilton chose to describe them, rather than a run-down of features and attributes.  So why did I read it?  If I knew all this in advance, why did I even drop a dime on it?    I enjoy erotica, and, as previously mentioned, I'm a faerie fan.  I expected the writing to be terrible, but bearable enough for a few moments of shallow enjoyment.  Then I expected to come here, slap down a single star, and go on my merry way.  If at all possible, I am even more offended by the fact the most of Ms. Hamilton's ideas were good, but she blew it by not following through, or by failing to explore character emotion, or by making the plot secondary to the sex.  To have ideas that are actually interesting and then to drop the ball is even worse than having no good ideas at all (Anne Rice's "Beauty" series, *cough*cough).  But I can't give Ms. Hamilton one star, because the ideas were there, shining just below the surface.  The idea of fairies as celebrities in the mortal world . . . the concept of a fairie exodus to the United States . . . old gods becoming fairies . . . etc, etc . . .  So the book gets two stars, and it could have garnered more if Ms. Hamilton had her priorities straight.  1. Ms. Hamilton, you are a grown woman.  Mention the business parts of the male chracters by name please.  Obscuring gential terms with "him" and "himself" makes you look sqeamish and unsure of yourself.  If you want to write something with a little heat and intensity, clarify the act, please.  2. Thesaurus.  3. If you want all the sex, make the non-sexual parts longer so that they represent a plot.  4. Why is everyone so rampantly heterosexual, and horrified at the idea of homosexuality?  These are fairies, not humans.  Why would they possess our prejudices?  5. Let Meredith sleep with unattractive characters now and again.  Refusing to do so makes her seem like an elitist snob.  Enough complaining.   Look at the reviews and see if this is a mess you want to wade into.  I've started the second book, but after the first "sharp and immediate" there, I've set it aside until my annoyance ends.  If you want a modern fairy tale, try "Tithe."  It's considered YA, but it's far more satisfying than Merry Gentry's world. 
 I didn't like this one. Here is why:      -It is unevenly paced and slackly directed. Heavy on the action/swash-buckling, lite on the substance.      -At no time was Sean Connery anyone but Sean Connery. He is surely an "international star" but I still        cringe when persona overwhelms character.      -Candice Bergen was annoyingly bland. The romance of the film is weak and always on the verge, leaving         the tension unrealized.      -The hyper-patriotism, something like Milius' hyper-masculine forte, overwhelms any nuance or adroitness         that a scenario such as this requires. Any research into this story will yield that the reality was that an         Englishman and his son were kidnapped, and that no military force was used. This is only an issue         because using the basic story as an adventure tale of American thuggery-diplomacy is less than exciting.         Unless you are a fan of rousing heavy handed mythos.      -I have never seen this many horses fall as their rider is shot or bombarded. It looks real, and accurate, but         I found it distracting.      -While the violence is unremitting, almost all the lead characters are as well. This left me uninterested in them. Except        Brian Keith's Teddy Roosevelt.  It's not all bad. Here's what I did like:      -Brian Keith. He's the best Teddy Roosevelt I've seen in film. That he wasn't nominated as a best supporting         actor is unfortunate.       -Jerry Goldsmith's score is rousing and epic, very good. He was nominated, deservedly. Predictably, he lost         to John Williams and Jaws.      -Billy Williams cinematography. Shot in Spain, doubling for Morocco-the scope and terrain are gorgeous        and epic.      -The stunt work is fabulous. 
 A theory intends to explain reality and make a truth claim. In this book, the theory presented does not apply to any form of social reality, and its truth claim can neither be verified, neither falsified. The author presents, somewhere from the dimness of deep metaphysical outerspace, a series of half baked philosophical assertions about IR theory that are at best incoherent and erroneous. In essence it is a pot of opportunistic eclecticism that nowhere achieves a synthesis that smells of coherence. Although he wants to explain all IR questions, he achieves to provide an understanding for none of them. What pretends to be a theory is nothing but a wolkenkuckucksheim that demonstrates the limits of a 'science' based on opportunism rather than truth, and its devoted students would probably continue joyfully to sing its praise even if it had been shown to anyones satisfaction that its presumptions were outlandish; because nothing whatsoever would count as a falsification of their beliefs. Do not buy this book if you sincerely intend to learn something about international politics, because there are much better choices around. Although the author might still be regarded as a fashion icon in his field, all he does is celebrate - under the label of positivism - the ambiguous and dubious as positive in itself. (... 
 I read Mamis' "When to Sell" and looked forward to this book.  I was disappointed to find "The Nature of Risk" is three parts psycho-babble and one part technical analysis.  The psycho-babble is Mamis' philosophy, but is almost incomprehensible.  And the TA is nothing that wasn't covered in his earlier book.  Buy "When to Sell" if you want a book about the stock market.  Buy this book if you've got nothing better to do with your $$ 
 I read this book as a part of a Chicano Literature course during my undergrad studies.  While I found the first 140 or so pages okay, I found the overall story a bit boring (educational, but boring).  Lest you think I am being unfair, let me note that the story did pick up again at the end and I do not recall ever having fallen asleep while reading it. (2 stars so far)  I really liked the use of language in creating the voice of the narrator.  It gave me the feeling that I was sitting with an elder aunt or grandmother who was telling the story to me.  (Make it 3 stars, bordering on 4).  So, why the 1 star?  Mainly because I did not like what I interpreted to be a thinly disguised attack on a straw man version of Catholicism and I can't rate it a zero.  I found many of the incidents in the story and especially the commentary of the narrator to be very critical of Catholicism.  I find it unfortunate that, like most critics of Catholicism, Castillo critizes/attacks a straw man version of Catholicism rather than the real thing.  In an interview the author was asked about fact checking in works of fiction (specifically in her book "Massacre of the Dreamers"), Castillo answered:  "No. There isn't any point in it. It's your opinion. It's your reflection, your reaction, your own opinion. When you write a critical -- and this isn't personal essays, these are critical essays -- then you have to prove ever single thing you say."  Maybe that's why she chose to attack a straw man rather than the real thing 
 If you think of the prime numbers as a Dr. Seuss staircase then this book's for you.  There are painfully cute analogies like throughout the book as the author shows off his faculty-lounge acculturation. It is least informed and most poorly written of the current spate of RH books.  Buy any of the others.  Avoid this one 
 This book explains things fairly well.  I would have rated it a 3 or 4, but they forgot the most important thing: THE SOLUTIONS TO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS!!!!!  Where are they???  Without the solutions to the practice problems a technical textbook is pretty much useless 
 I bought this to help with college after being out for 10yrs-almost impossible to install plus it does not allow you to make any adjustments if your professor wants it a certain way. Useless-buy the cheat sheet at barnes and noble 
 I've read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon books and enjoyed every one of them until I reached Hard Truth. After writing so many intellligent, suspenseful stories, Barr has joined what seems to be an open competition among mystery writers to see who can come up with the most despicable crime. Murder's not nasty enough? How about the murder of children? Still not gruesome enough? Add incest/rape/torture...you get the picture.  Ostensibly such books are meant to give the reader insight into the minds of evil villains, but really, who cares? The kind of evil depicted in these books is not just disgusting but banal. It's like bad language in humor--in general, it's just a cover for bad writing.   In Hard Truth, Barr outdoes all of the competition for sheer nastiness, in the process leaving out the features that make her other books so enjoyable: the charm and intelligence of her main charcter, the well-reasoned defense of nature, the lush descriptions of each story's setting. I found this book neither enlightening nor remotely enjoyable. I give it two stars for an interesting but largely wasted character (a recently paralyzed ice climber), but otherwise I'm sorry I spent my time and money on it 
 One can't be sure that this book isn't deliberately exploiting a cynical belief that most business books are so bad, that if this weren't crappy, it wouldn't sell. Even for someone who believes in Csik's theory of flow, this book is a no-win blow-out. Instead of making clear statements backed by evidence, the book's tone and presentation are mere editorializing assertions. There is no reason to read this, when his original popularization, Flow, more carefully and clearly summarizes Csikszentmihalyi's interesting research. 
 Im surprised Rhino would put out anything but a complete collection spanning all of her labels......country stars are notorious for jumping from one label to another, which makes it hard to get all the hits in one place.  This CD covers her later, WB years, with "Dont It Make My Brown Eyes Blue" thrown in for gravy.  Nothing from her Columbia years, or her first big hits from United Artists.  The majors labels could make a collection this bad, so why should Rhino sully their sterling reputation for quality with this garbage?  I dont know, but I hope it isn't a sign of things to come..... 
 DO NOT BUY PLATES FROM AMAZON! Don't get me wrong, I love Amazon and have had no other problems with their services...but...this was crazy. I ordered these plates and they came in a box with a piece of brown paper as packing material!! Then I returned them and the 2nd set had some bubble wrap, but not nearly enoough - broken again!! Not worth the time or money! I must also say that I ordered several other glass kitchen items and they were fine. 
  Wanting something to read on vacation, I hurriedly grabbed the Vintage paperback edition from a dusty shelf in the back of my home office.  The book had belonged to my stepson many years ago. As I thumbed through the pages, it began to fall apart.   I do not recall having to read The Sound and the Fury in college, but I knew it was famous.  Other than that, I came to the book with an open mind but expecting excellence.  To that end, I was sorely disappointed, despite some fine passages, but even those often contained unclear elements.     From the start the story came across as gibberish.  Time jumped around, and characters appeared with little or no introduction.  Gradually a sense of story began to sink in, but by then, what might have been significant in the earlier pages was already lost to me.  I wondered what connection the title had to the story.  I struggled through the entire book, finding later sections to be more coherent, particularly the last, but I was unable to gain a full appreciation of the story.  And I wasn't about to reread the book repeatedly to obtain it.   There seems to be no effort at word economy, particularly in dialogue.  There are endless rambling paragraphs and only four "chapters" for the 400 pages of text.   Worst of all, there is inadequate exposition throughout the book.  There is no introduction telling the reader how the book is constructed, most notably, that it begins with an account by an idiot.  The idea of having a family's story related by several  members if fine, so is writing in stream of conscious, but adequate exposition is needed to orient the reader.     Frustrated during the reading, I thumbed through it and discovered the appendix which described the Compson family.  Most of this material should have been presented early in the book, but even that would not have provided adequate exposition.  After reading the book, I learned that the appendix was added some time after the first edition to help the reader.  That should be a big hint that the book is lacking in exposition.  I believe that good exposition is the responsibility of a writer.   This book is more of a puzzle than a story, and the latter is sacrificed for the former.  The author does not lead you through the story; he throws you into it.  For those who marvel at the literary value of this book, I say, "The emperor has no clothes. 
 The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)  The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.  I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish 
 The information in this book on many of the plants listed in it is incorrect. If you try to use the names given you will not be able to find them. Cross referece is a must if you intend to use this book in the  buisness 
 This book is not as represented.  Ninety percent of it is historical detail you can get from other sources, fluffed into thin, uninteresting interviews, some of which hardly merit the term.  Combine this with a flat-footed, self-conscious, second-rate translation, and it's an agonizing read, filled even with annoying sentence fragments.  Like this.  The publisher clearly told Orizio to fill in the empty parts so they could have a book to sell.  Don't waste your time.  Read TIME instead; it's much more compelling 
 Remember the time when Staind was full of rage and pain and tended to scream a lot? Those days look like they're over. The album was a big disappointment when you realize the almost instant progression from hard rock to teenage girl-friendly ballads. Don't get me wrong - I really enjoyed "So Far Away" as a single, but the entire cd seemed to be lacking the edge that made Staind so amazing in the beginning. I hope their newest album that comes out this month has a little more edge that the old school Staind fans are craving 
 A Best of White Lion album? What are they selling blank CDs? Seriously, the 80's had great bands, but towards the end things were getting a little ridiculous. The final nail in the coffin for 80's rock was White Lion and Warrant. Nuff said 
 A question for anyone who has this dvd pack. I am after a movie my friends and I watched years ago. It was about a lady going out for cigarettes on a wet night and having to stop for petrol on the way home. A killer is running lose as we hear on the news, playing on the car radio.  The petrol attendant worries her in the way he is acting. He tries to get her out of the car but she wont. He attacks the car trying to get her out.  What she does not realise is the killer is in the back of her car and the attendant is only trying to save her...  This short movie was on with 3 other movies one being about a boy being sucked into a video game.  We would greatly appreciate any help finding out the name of the dvd or tape which has these four short stories on it.  We are wondering if they are on this dvd or any of the others listed with amazon.  Thank you. Aussie Girls  
 I returned this product.  I was unable to turn the unit on or off once the batteries were installed.  The batteries blocked the on/off switch from the internal switch 
 Imagine the biggest bore or show off you have ever had the misfortune to be waylaid by in a plane or at a party. Now you've got the idea of this book. Apparently, the writers, instead of sharing their travel and food adventures, engage in a sort of "Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, I've been to Timbuktu and you haven't," monologue. Since the Travelers' Tales series books are usually pretty good, this was disappointing.  An example of how very bad it was, in one article about bad road coffee, in the first paragraph Tom Bently reminds us how he kissed his Krups. He couldn't just say "coffee-maker," but he must share with us the upscale brand name of his coffee maker. How gauche can you get 
 I don't remember what inspired me to buy this book, but GOD is it boring.  The author thinks he is the only one to understand Nostadamus, and proves it by droning on for page after page of mindless drivlle 
 Don't get me wrong here.  I am a fan of Anderson's work in general, especially Boogie Nights and Punch-Drunk Love.  But I just could handle Hard Eight.  Usually Anderson's slower pace is a welcome change for me as I really enjoy character driven dramas.  The acting was pretty good, but I just thought the script lacked anything of interest.  Maybe next time, but I can't recommend actually buying this one unless you want a complete Anderson collection 
 I watched this when if first came out when I was a kid.  It seemed good at the time.  I didn't realize how short it was, there's hardly any talking.  The only thing I enjoy about this movie is the music 
 This book just dosent make the reader excited and thus makes reading this book a chore.  At this time all that has been said int this book has been said elsewhere in a much more interesting format 
 I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time 
 The Covert-One series, written by a variety of authors, unfortunately does not live up to Ludlum's standards. Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.  The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other. In the middle of the book somewhere, it all comes together leading to a high-testoterone (but somewhat unbelievable) climax 
 Although Gritz's record in Vietnam seems to be accurate the titles he has given himself seem to be in doubt.  For example, he claims to be "The" American Soldier in Gen. Westmoreland's Memoirs of the  Vietnam war.  Although, Gritz is mentioned in the such titled chapter  Westmoreland has stated that said title isn't for Bo Gritz only but is a  commentary on the American Soldier in general.    Also, Gritz gives himself  the title of "Vietnam's most decorated Green Beret Commander" yet  when checking with the officials of that time period they state that no  such title exists or was ever given to Gritz alone.    Clint Eastwood may  have said it best - "You're a legend in your own mind."     Gritz's tie in with David Duke for a brief period during the presidential  campaign of 1988 and his baptism into Pastor Pete Peters Identity Christian  movement leaves one to wonder about Gritz's feelings about other races or  backgrounds.  To be fair Gritz is the father of two AmerAsian children.  He  is currently writing a new book regarding the future of this nation and  recently entered into his fourth marriage 
 There is nothing in this book that an intermediate or higher student doesn't already know.  If your new to Japanese, go for it otherwise don't waste your money 
   I'm surprised this book has gotten the reviews it has (I actually ordered it based on them).  The errors in the code/instructions are horrendous, and I'm only on the second chapter.  (Many steps seem left out)  I suppose I cannot understand why someone would write a instructional book and then fail to follow their own steps to check if they work.    That being said, the book is not all bad.  I've learned a few neat things from the previous chapter.  I suggest, in the future, the author(s) include source for each 'step' in the projects and have others check their instructions.  I would be entirely lost without the downloadable source code (apress.com), but it's a shame readers have to rely on it.    If you can, check it out at a library for a week before you buy 
 It was flat after one night of sleeping.  We had to blow it up to capacity every night and would be sleeping on the ground by morning.    Also, be aware that you need an AC outlet to pump it up ... it's NOT for camping 
 Being a big Russell Banks fan, I was very much looking forward to reading The Darling, a book that addresses a subject matter that is clearly a departure for Banks.  I wish he'd stuck with trailer parks and the rural working class. The only reason I finished the book was because I was so hoping something bad would happen to the heroine.  She is perhaps the least likable, least sympathetic heroine in a book I've ever read. What ever happened to writers writing what they know?  Banks using a woman as a first person narrator was a big mistake. Hannah rings so hollow to me, a supremely self-absorbed, irritating and, in many ways, dangerous person to anyone she encounters. The dialogue throughout -- particularly the trite conversations among the characters about the "sixties" -- was contrived and unreal.  I was immensely disappointed 
 Prometheus Deception, like most of Ludlum's books, is very fast paced with little break in the action. It is full of twists and turns, with the unexpected occurring every now and then. However, the book seems like a desperate attempt at coming up with a plot and then trying to make the whole story somewhat sensible (needless to say, Ludlum fails miserably). There are instances when you're left wondering whether the sequence of events or the events themselves even make sense. Yes, we are living in a world of increased government surveillance, but I'm sure Ludlum, being the espoinage maestro that he is, could come up with a better plot than this 
 What a pile of vapid tripe. Reading this book actually lowered my IQ. I quess I could've felt stupider, I could've actually paid for this book. If the overexcessive use of the terms "darling", "amazing", and "delicious" don't give you the douche-chills, then you might actually be able to plod your way through this refuse without wanting to take a hot iron to each of the characters' faces. Anyone who likes this vacuous load of landfill fodder probably thinks that Paris Hilton is a great musician 
 This hardcore conservative did not enjoy this book.  The book is filled with a wealth of eye-opening information on significant people that I did not know but should (like Hugo Chavez's new best friend, Noam Chomsky), but the reading is so laborious and draining that I cannot recommend it.  It has none of the light-hearted fun that we often get from Rush Limbaugh.  Rather, it brought to mind the dark experience of listening alone to Michael Savage in a bad mood after dark.  The cheeky title is misleading - this was a joyless book to read 
 I have to start by saying that I own this movie, albeit accidentally.  I won't throw it out or give it away, lest it fall into the wrong hands, but I also can't bring myself to destroy it- it is the test, the ultimate standard by which all other movies, and sometimes people, are judged.  First, you must ask yourself- do I want to watch this movie?  CAN I watch this movie?  If you successfully watch the movie, you can either award yourself great kudos for facing the horrors that the human mind can inflict, or you can hang your head in shame for being unphased.  If this movie does not gross you out at least once, you REALLY have some soul searching to do.  Learn to read...something..  Second...I have told many people...if anyone recommends this film to you...he or she is not your friend.  If they're doing it to shock you...maybe they're still okay...if they say, "Hey, I know this great movie..."  Run.  This is not a person you need to be around.    Third...you may want to watch this movie so that you understand the rest of us.  "It's not Pink Flamingos bad, but it's up there."  or "It was like Pink Flamingos with old people."  This means nothing to you if you haven't seen it.  Maybe that's a good thing.    This review may be a little disjointed...it's like John Waters just wanted to see how far he could go and still get paid.  It's like the 'joke', "What has 2 legs and bleeds?....Half a cat."  It's not funny, but you laugh at the audacity that someone had to tell that as a joke.    I have experienced Pink Flamingos.  I'd give it no stars if I could, because I think it's an excercise in EXTREMELY bad taste, but it's a fascinating social experiment.  John Waters...I shake my head in wonder at you.. 
 Dealing with uninvited guests?Trying to drive out annoying relatives?Need help disciplining children?Do you wear a purity ring&want to keep from getting "in the mood" with your honey? Then this Rough Guide is PERFECT for you,serving these many purposes!  It opens with a "Yodeling Lesson" that will quiet any child--with boredom."Yodeling Addiction" is a perfect reason for checking into rehab (with other celebrities).There's yodeling with a European club beat in "Jaga Ode",and the experimental yodels of "Haiku Lingo" and "Yodeling Robot" (about a robot enamored of Dolly Parton).This album is also a virtual "Small World" with yodels from Mexico,the Alps,India--and even country western Hawaiian yodeling-and all are annoying.  I'm surprised this album hasn't made it onto Jim Nader's "Annoying Music Show." It would be vindication if it did 
 With all due respect to different tastes, I found Five Deadly Venoms lethally boring. I thought the dialog was trite and incoherent, the humor lame and predictable, the martial arts stunts and display average to bad. The plot lack subtlety, imagination or surprise and although some of the sets and costumes looked authentic, I could not finish this loser. Perhaps it was better than bad when it first came out, but hard to watch after more recent kung fu fare. 
 I've always loved the original trilogy, but these prequals are just awful. This episode 3 was probably the most dissapointing. I had hoped that maybe lucas could salvage this horrible trilogy but he just made it worse. Horrible acting and writing really sent this movie down the toilet. The only slightly decent thing in the movie was the lightsaber scene between anakin and obi wan. 
 The guys have nice voices and the ladies will love their squeaky good looks. But don't take them seriously. They are a money machine 
 Disney keeps goming out with sequels to the best DVD's ever made.The  Jungle Book Limited Issue Is the best movie ever made.My Grandson watches it all the time. Its made for  the child also the adult like me. I bought  Jungle Book 2 totally dissapointed in the dvd.  I did not like it at all I returned it.Its a horible movie for children:  Disney stop ruining our excellent dvds.I give this dvd A - 
 This book is so lame... I regret every minute I spent reading it.  
 I can't argue with the fact that the author knows his research material.  The problem is that the book is so full of examples, that it makes for a very difficult and painful read.  There is no flow, no voice, just examples.  And I mean multiple examples in one paragraph.  No real analysis, just a compression of facts and other information. This would have been better off as a bibliography and not an attempt at an actual book 
 I agree with other reviewers that said the book is not very helpful if you are writing a PCI device driver.  It's full of register definitions and timing diagrams but I never got a feel for how to put it all together.  This book may be useful for hardware designers but it is largely worthless for software engineers.  If you're writing a driver and you want more info, don't waste your money here 
 This movie does not even lead up to the game. The plot isn't good at all. Terrible acting performances by most of the actors/actresses. I was surprise to know that Kylie Mingoue was Cammy. The fight scenes were fake. My favorites in the game were Ken and Ryu, and they made them unreal. And for the rest of the other fighters, their background stories are also fake and very hard to believe. Basically, the whole movie from start to end was very boring. In my own opinion...they SHOULD MAKE A REMAKE OF STREET FIGHTER!!!! SAVE UR MONEY!! 
 This is just another of many alphabetical thesauruses. The reverse dictionary is a joke. There are reverse dictionary entries (WORD FIND) against a small fraction of words. If you want to look up something you have to guess the word it will be under eg if you need to find out "spontaneous abortion" is called "miscarriage" you need to guess to look under "pregnancy". If you want to find "anorexia nervosa" from "dieting to the point of emaciation" you need to guess it will be under "neurosis". You would do better with one of the better crossword dictionaries. When the title started with Roget's I expected something taking you from general words to specific words as Roget does, as Glazier in Word Menu does and as is done in WordNet, a free program by Princeton University available on the web. If Roget was still around he would sue. Then to add Superthesaurus makes you really expect something out of the ordinary. The quotations are a waste of time. I have "The Synonym Finder" by Rodale and it has many more synonyms and is a better book. This book starts with a misleading title and then adds in quotations for some words and WORD FIND for others. It seems to be trying to do many things without any real notion of what it is trying to achieve. It may well be a good book for professional writers but for the average user I would give it a miss. I might not have bought it myself if I was able to view the sample pages. Since Amazon changed to its new "look inside" format my browser closes with a message to send details of the fault to Microsoft. 
 I will usually read and accept anything, but this book is just so beyond fact for even realistic fiction.  I could have handled this book a lot better if there was no "Frankie".  The character Frankie is just too unbelievable.  I work with "talented and gifted" children that are Frankie's age (8 years old) and not one of them is even remotely this advvanced.  If Frankie was say, 12 or 13 I could accept her maturity, her dedication to her music and so forth, but this is not even believable to anyone who has a child or works with them.  It would be tolerable if Frankie was not the center of the book.  They spend more time about Frankie this and Frakie that, then on the main plot of the book.  This is the 3rd book that I have read or at least tried to read from Iris Johansen and it will be my last.  I just don't like the way she writes or her main characters.  Evertime I buy another one of her books I am always hoping that this will be the one that changes my mind.  Oh well, another book to donate 
 I did not like this audio book.  Out of all of Danielle Steel audio books this one was the worse and most depressing story. In a world of finding a new job and starting to date again. It was a story of a women who was having a problem finding the right man.  It tells you a sad story of the man who used her and the man who was afraid to commit himself to another woman long after his wife died and he tryed to started to date again. 
 Zahlan covers the history of the Gulf states with special emphasis on the history of the various monarchical families. Sadly, her attitude is unflinchingly fawning; she seems afraid to say one negative thing about  these countries and their economic and political challenges. As well, the  writing style is very dry and wooden. Her bias is symbolized by one of the  maps showing the UAE as extending westward all the way to Dawhat as Salwa,  at the southwest base of Qatar. This reflects absurdly ambitious  territorial claims of the UAE at a time when the Saudis have claimed the  coast in the vicinity of Khawr Duwayhin, southeast of Qatar. This map is  emblematic of the book's flaws. A much better book despite its age (1980)  is 'Arabia, the Gulf, & the West' by J.B. Kelly 
 not a review about the films but of the quality of the so called brand new mint dvds.I recieved this collection along with the other 2 glamour collections and the first thing i notice when i open the dvds is that the condition of the discs were not in the condition i would expect they were scratched all to bloody hell on the sides of the discs facing up on both discs one and two i complained to amazon they sent me new dvds and they were in the same poor condition i then purchased them at a local walmart and there was no improvement so the bottom line is that when you get a new dvd examine it under a light because as with this and all dvds there is a possibility of it going out of print and your copy could be worth some cash but who would buy scratched dvds. the manufacturers have forgotten what new is i suppos 
 Expections run high when a 600 plus page encyclopedia of SF is published. The major section of the text, "Science Fiction on the Page," devoted to SF writers, takes up nearly 300 pages. However, this encyclopedia is fannishly idiosyncratic, to say the least, as the following list of omitted writers attests - to wit: Tony Daniel, Avram Davidson, Gordon R. Dickson, George Alec Effinger, James Gunn, Alexander Jablokov, Nancy Kress, Ian McDonald, George R. R. Martin, Andre Norton, Rebecca Ore, Robert Reed, Mike Resnick, Frank M. Robinson, Fred Saberhagen, Charles Sheffield, Dan Simmons, Clifford Simak, Cordwainer Smith, William Tenn, Jack Williamson, George Zebrowski, and David Zindell. No offense, but frankly, I could have done with a little less on Eugene Byrne, Simon R. Green, Kim Newman, et. al., for entries on Terry Bisson, C.M. Kornbluth, Stanley Weinbaum, Robert L. Forward, Michael Flynn, Michael Bishop, Barry Malzberg, James Tiptree, Jr., George Turner, et.al. The number of important SF writers neglected in this enclyclopedia is staggering. This is less a comprehensive reference work than a deficient compilation by a fan whose predisposition toward Brithsh SF and occasional crankiness makes for a disappointing entry into SF reference field 
 I was looking for a fun CD for my daughter's wedding. I think I bought every CD on [...] that I thought would work. This CD certainly did not. It was full of the old standards, some of them acceptable but most of them hokey and reflecting the era they were recorded in (the '50s). Most people don't know you can go to the library for FREE recordings of these old songs. The marketers just slap together a bunch of old melodies and make a fortune on their sale, under some package. Since I purchased around 25 CDs for my daughter's wedding, let me tell you I know what I am taling about. I could have gone to the library to get these old renditions without spending [...] bucks. I can't believe they are still selling these compilations of Dean Martin and Lou Monte, etc. We've heard it all already!!! Save your money 
 I just don't get why people like this album. It stinks. "Sara" is Dylan at his whiny worst. "Mozambique" was the result of a drunken bet about how many words Dylan could rhyme with Mozambique. And the worst thing of all on the album is Rivera's screeching violin on every track. About her: Dylan was riding in a limo and saw her walking on the street with a violin case. He liked the way she walked so he picked her up and promised to allow her to play on his album. And so it goes. "Bringin' it all Back Home" this ain't.   I am a huge Dylan fan and have most of is catalogue, but this is the one album of his that I just can't stand. Not one song works.  If you are new to Dylan , get "Bringin it all Back Home", "Highway 61", "Blonde on Blonde", and "Blood on the Tracks". If you already have those, there are about 20 more to get before you bother with this one.  Oh, and one more thing: Reuben Carter was guilty 
 Avid fans of Sidney Sheldon will probably enjoy this book.  It is indeed as is noted in the editorial reviews a rough-hewn and crudely carved sequel of "The Other Side of Midnight."  Sheldon does not deviate from the routine trashy forumla replete with cliche bedroom scenes and a plethora of ruthless characters.    Set in the late 1940s right after WWII, Catherine, wife of pilot Larry whom readers first encountered in "The Other Side of Midnight" regains her memory.  She remembers how cruel Larry was to her and how he jilted her for his mistress, Noelle Page.  Indeed, Noelle was the kept mistress of one Constantin Demiris who was written to sound like an ersatz Ari Onasis.  Demiris, like a magician can make those in his disfavor disappear.  Exit Larry and Noelle in the first installment.  In this book, Catherine, the long-lost heroine is restored to glory and is swept off her feet by a man who is loosely based on the cliche Cavalry men.    A psychiatrist and an eclectic mix of patients are thrown into this story; just how they are directly tied into the main plot has never been addressed.  One character who is clearly written as an autistic savant displays some of the more prominent autistic behaviors.  He is echolalic; he recites long chains of information and he knows the number and type of vehicles he passes in route to the doctor's office.  His activities are solitary and few; he does not voluntarily interact with others.  I am really tired of stories like this that portray characters with autism as automaton-like savants with isolated abilities that are far removed from the social world.  I think stories like this do a grave disservice to those with autism and for others who come across autistic characters because it is just perpetuating a stereotype.  This book does not really contain much of a mystery.  It's just ruthless people getting even with each other.  Even good old Demiris' wife Melina enters this story after having been relegated to shadow figure status in the original.  Same old fare.  An attorney who was directly involved in a trial engineered by Demiris re-enters the picture.  Some fancy manuevering, and he runs away with the show.  Literally 
 This is a book that only a pedophile would want to read. It is blatent and unappoligetically child pornography. It contains graphic details about the molestation of a 4 year year old boy through his adulthood. This book does not have artistic integrity. It really is just pornography for the sick, sick, sick. When it refers to this repeated molestation by all sorts of women as abuse Irving puts the word abuse in quotations - "abuse." This implies that it is really not abuse, when in fact any sexual contact with four year olds should unequivically be considered molestation and violation and rape of a child. John Irving should have more social responsibility than to put this kind of sewage out there.   I will not finish it. Though, I will try to read future novels as I have long been an avid fan of Iring's work. 
 This is a review of this particular edition and not a review of the story itself (which I would give 5 stars).  I was expecting a nice collectible copy (in 1 volume) of the original trilogy but instead this is a newly bound edition of the annotated chronicles.  The original story is still there but there is the annoying side-bar annotation which make it difficult to concentrate on the main text because it gets pushed towards the center.  Therefore if you intend to read this copy you will have to keep the book fully spread out on your lap and strain to read the text as it runs into the center of the book and becomes obscured by the fold.  I wonder why Wizards did not simply produce the original trilogy in a deluxe edition similar to editions we have seen for Lord of the Rings and other classic fantasy trilogies.  The art work is decent but the choice of selection is somewhat baffling.  There is no apparent order to the full color pictures so they in no way correspond to the text.  In fact, some of the pictures do not even belong to the story at all; several are from the Legends trilogy and even later books.  Conspicuous by their abscence are some classic scenes such as the death of Sturm or Kitiara revealed as the dragon highlord.  For a $75 price tag you would think that the full color pages wouldn't be cheap gloss, but they are, and hence the thin text pages tend to stick to them.    The only good thing I can say, besides that the story itself is excellent, is that the binding is tight and well made, and the hand sewn red bookmark is a nice touch.  If you already own a good edition of the chronicles trilogy, and especially if you have the hardcover annotated chronicles in your possession, I would pass on this over priced copy.  
 All sizzle and no steak.  I am a fan of Senge's initial work.  This one falls short of making a mark.  Maybe I expected too much.  In any regard, I felt suckered after getting half-way thru this thing and I quit. Hope you have a different experience 
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 I gave this album 2 stars because this is apparently the same band that produced "Logic Will Break Your Heart", although you would never know this by listening to "Without Feathers".  As other people have noted, this album is infinitely different than the amazing "Logic Will Break Your Heart".  I fell in love with "Logic..", and when this album came out I was first in line to pick it up. After a thorough listen, I examined the packaging.  I thought, "Did I buy the wrong cd?  Dear God, please, did someone accidently place a different cd in this case?"  But, to my dismay, it was The Stills.  Say what you want about this album, but I don't see how anyone who really felt "Logic..." could be anything but disappointed in this album.  I've tried examining it from a different angle.  I've given it a "fresh listen".  Nothing.  I got the same feeling from this album that I got after I watching "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace".  What happened to the magic, man? 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others 
 The Rhinoskin case works fine.  The nano fits well in the case.  No problems getting it in and out.  My issue with the case is the weight.  I'm just guessing b/c I don't have tech specs, but it feels like it makes the nano twice as heavy.  One of things I was so excited about when I got my nano was that it was so light.  This case takes the joy out of that.  Don't get me wrong; it's still pretty light.  But other all-plastic cases I've tried don't test the elastic on my shorts as much as this one does 
 I would only recommend this book to people who want an easy read. This is because it was boring, every page was the same and there was little excitement.  You always knew what was going to happen next, the author's way of writing was very plain and there was little detail. Every chapter was about living in hiding and how bored they got. Once in awhile something exciting happened, like the German soldiers came to the house. It was hard to concentrate because I didn't find the book interesting. Also, I didn't find any connections to the characters. They were both older. Also, I have never hid with my life on the line. I would recommend this book to people looking for something easy to ready, with little excitement 
 It seems many reviews discuss this book through the prism of their politics, as opposed to reviewing it _as a book_.  As a book, I was quite disappointed. Firstly, a good half of the book is taken up with the PRE-war planning on invading Iraq, rehashing material presented (much better) in Woodward's or Clark's books.  When we finally get to the post-invasion planning, the book suffers from a fatal flaw - the author's own axe-grinding. The author was a principal on the multi-agency project, led as I remember out of the State Department, which compiled a long set of guides for how the reconstruction should go. In one of the more notable (but already known) failures, these guides were discarded by the Bush administration, as the authors were viewed as too "soft". OK, fine. However, the author harps on this over and over and over. Over and over, the book reads like this: "So then Bremer made this decision, which turned out wrong. We told you so.".  This is also weakened by the fact that the authors recommendation is virtually _always_ "form a multi-sided commission to study the issue" - not exactly gripping reading. Frankly, I can see why more action-minded minds might have started to ignore the author and his comission - sometimes multi-sided comissions are not the right answer!  The blurb for the book gives the impression that the author was a "True believer" (one of Rice's friends, etc.) who became disullusioned over time. This may be true, but the book is written instead with the advantage of 20/20 hindsight - the author's recommendations were always right, Bremer's/Cheney's always wrong, according to the book. Not only does this strain credulity, but it made this a rather unenlightening read for me - i would have been much more interested in something that discussed how the planning _evolved_, rather than the litany of "we told you so's" that this book presents. 
 there's nothing you can tell clearly about this movie, because from the very beginning to the end, i've just heard lota f words; f....this, f....that, typical stupid stereotyped mafia talks. and i swear to god when i watched this pathetic movie and thought that if mafia could be this stupid, and if they could just use that fxxx word in every sentence they talked, and if they thought that by using this fxxx word once they open their mouth to talk and used this f word to show their smartness and toughness, or if they thought by simply using this big F word and they could kill thy kingdom come, then america might not look like what we're seeing now. maybe the mafia could just use this big word to kill all the terrorists in the world, maybe they could just use it to solve all the problems and guess what? they're just using that word to kill each other. or is this just what hollywood think that all the mafia mob guys could walk the walk easier by simply using this big F word to talk the talk? i don't have any clue, man 
 I have read every Leaphorn/Chee book by Hillerman more than once and am a great fan. I just finished this book and discussed it with a friend.. we both agreed it was so disappointing.. we cannot believe it was written by the same person. The writing was awkward and heavy-handed... by the second page I suspected something was wrong here. It reads like some cheap Harlequin mystery/romance. The sensitive handling of Navajo spiritual beliefs, the beautiful rendering of the landscape, the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing.  All I can say is, the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of Tony Hillerman's caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye... he has given us much enjoyment.... he deserves better.  And if someone else is fleshing out Hillerman's plot lines.. the public should be warned 
 i bought a green ipod scok, thinking the it would be that same as the picture they show at the top of the page, but it ended up having a lighter green than what they showed and what i wanted. 
 This is my first review and i thought it was worth my time to write this one so here you go.I only picked up this book to add to my library because  i heard Tom  Flowers was a good author on the subject.This might be alright for a NOVICE grower but even then you might as well start with a GOOD alround book.Im new at hydro and i would never recommend this book, critical info is not there as far as (ph,tds,ec,meter details and functions,mediums and differences,qaulity of the h20 specs,) even the equipment that is listed is terrible and theres ALOT better options now.It really seems just like any book from the 80s and now its WAY out dated,George Cervantes updated version of indoor cultivators chapters on meters,ph,h20,and hydro is a way better choice for the novice or expert with all the new equipment and setups+lots of great pics.One more thing Tom Flowers book is about 85 pages buts seems like 50and very poor info seems to by a BIG rip off !!! MEL FRANK..ED ROSENTHAL...GEORGE CERVANTES... the 3kings on the subject Connel Clarke ok too. 
 I'm a big fan of Russ Freeman and The Rippingtons, and I also own the first Benoit-Freeman Project cd.  Although I must admit that I used to enjoy it, I quickly grew tired of Benoit's playing.  The Benoit Freeman Project had a concert scheduled in my area so I ordered the cd hoping to receive it in advance of the concert, but it did not arrive.  My wife and I thought the concert was very disappointing.  Russ Freeman is a great guitar player, but his playing that night was uninspired besides playing "second fiddle" to David Benoit.  Benoit does have talent, but he overplays everything until you just get tired of listening to him.  We could not wait for the concert to end.  I received the new cd a few days after the concert and I immediately shipped it back - unopened.  Sorry, folks, but this cd is a bore and a waste of money. 
 I know that I will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... This is one of only 2 books that I have ever read that I truly REGRET devoting the time to , but once I start a book I always finish.I don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this.  I just don't get it.  The main character was quite annoying to me and the story was SO SLOW and predictable I really just wanted it to end. I would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you I am sorry.   
 I bought this book for two reasons - one because it's on a list of required reading for a doula certification I'm currently working on and two because of all the great reviews on here.  I can't say I was very impressed with the book overall though.  There are parts that are pretty good - I liked the information on water births and I do like that overall the book it very pro-birth and pro-natural pain relief, etc. etc.  However it also comes across as very biased to me and anti-men.  And the information on alcohol was just disturbing and wrong.  I was also very disturbed when I read the section on diapering where she compared cloth to disposables - she states that women who use cloth change their babies less often and that therefore using disposables is better for the baby.  This is such an absurd statement and shows that the author not only has no experience in using cloth diapers but obviously didn't even bother to talk to anyone that does.  It's impossible to leave a child in a cloth diaper as long as one can in a disposable!!  Independent research studies have shown that cloth diapers get changed on average 2 to 3 times MORE often then disposables.  That section was so off-base that it made me wonder about the rest of the content 
 Just read Podur's review after seeing link below.  He also wrote "Although he [Deibert] tries to tiptoe round the record of Latortue and his foreign backers, Deibert sets clear pointers as to the major culprit. `Aristide had not run out of cards to play' he writes of a clash on 7 March 2004, a week after the invasion, when the ousted president was being shuttled, a virtual hostage, between African airports. A joint PNH-MINUSTAH assault on a Lavalas demonstration in September 2004 is described as `an explosion of violence by Aristide partisans'; Deibert uncritically reproduces the Latortue government's unsubstantiated--and scarcely credible--assertion that `Aristide's financial and moral support of the rebellion from South Africa' was to blame for the deaths that ensued."   Someone should also mention that Deibert has supported the Latortue dictatorship  at every turn.  No wonder that apologists for imperialism such as Michael Shifter would write a glowing review.  Shifter's Inter American Dialouge is in part funded by the World Bank which has long been after a privatiztion of Haiti's public assets!  What the hell was seven stories press thinking???  
 Dialog was unoriginal and juvenile.  Plot looked like many others blood and gore movies.  I hated this movie 
 I ordered this DVD player so I wouldn't wear down my Xbox by playing movies on it all the time.  I didn't have any of the audio problems that others have reported, however, after about 4-6 weeks of use it just died.  I couldn't even get it to power on.  If you're looking for a cheap DVD player this will do, just remember, You get what you pay for 
 Before all of you who already read the book and liked it start slamming me with 'not helpfuls,' keep in mind I'm just trying to be honest here and give the would-be-readers another view. I thought the concept of this novel sounded interesting, but was almost embarrassed by the poor writing/character development. The characters and a good deal of the dialogue are quite unbelievable-- they sound like a conservative Christian's perspective of 'pagans' --the author tries to include lingo and details that sound like he's in-the-know, but instead it comes off as false-- as though research was done by reading stuff rather than from personal experience-- it felt totally out of touch. Almost like how non-Christian authors who don't know too many Christians would portray an evangelical Christian character. I feel that in reality, a lot of people who aren't already Christians would be turned off by this book-- especially if a friend gave it to them hoping to convert them like Lester. And a lot of Karen's words really do sound like a tract even though they're couched by a conversational tone. I'd love to think that Lester would really respond to her words like he does, but the dialogue just does not sound like real life--it sounds like someone's made-up dialogue. I guess a good test would be to give this book to 30 friends who are more 'like' Lester than Karen and see what they think 
 In the case of HD Radio, the HD does not stand for high-definition, but hybrid-digital. HD Radio implements something called digital IBOC, which has only 60% the coverage of regular analog radio, poor signal penetration into structures, and causes adjacent-channel interference. When an HD receiver goes out of range of the digital IBOC signal, there may be a delay, as it switches back and forth to analog. HD Radio has extra HD channels, which evidentually, are just extra low-bitrate streams of repetitive terrestrial radio. Save your money and get Satellite Radio, Wi-Fi Radio, or iRadio (iRadio will be appearing in Rokr E2 cellular phones), which have hundreds of stations HD Radio just carries local stations. Wi-Max, or wide-area wireless access, will bring Internet Radio to portable devices, including automobile radios, by 2008. Sirius has just come out with the Stiletto, which receives Internet Radio via Wi-Fi hotspots, as Wi-Max will eventually allow for reception everywhere. Cingular and Sprint Wireless have 50 radio channels, available through their cellular phones, for a small fee. As a matter of fact, over 200 XM Satellite Radio and HD Radio stations are free on AOL Radio, so there is no need to buy expensive HD Radio receivers.  
 I bought this book not realizing it was just a condensed version of the author's book Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming.  There is nothing new here except a CD you don't need.  If you are new to ludid dreaming you want to stick to Laberge's previous work.  If you have already read that, you won't need to spend your money on this.  It's like the cliffnotes version with pretty packaging and a CD thrown in to make it sound worth the money.  It's simply not 
 This book might be great for some people... I just wasn't one of them. I like Robin Mckinley, I loved "Beauty" by her, and I really really wanted to love this book... but I didn't. I would advise anyone interested in buying it to make sure they read the first few pages of the books first. If the style didn't bother you, and your mind didn't start to go numb then this might be the book for you. And more power to you! But don't just buy the book because it's written by Robin Mckinley... in my humble opinion it's definately not her best work. For me it drug on and on and on, I couldn't even finish it, I got halfway through and decided I couldn't handle the migraines the book was inducing. But that's just me, like I said read a couple of pages and decide for yourself. If you dont like the first couple of pages though... don't except it to get any better... it doesn't 
 While it looks like a great toy, this never installed on my XP home system.  After 3 hours with Logictech support (that is phone time, not the many hours of waiting time!) and many attempts at setting privledges in the Registry, it still never installed.  Logitech blames Microsoft, and it may well be true, but they should have a manual way of starting services instead of relying on automation.  I am very disappointed that I never got a chance to even try the pen.  If you do take the chance on it, be prepared to ship it back because it may never even install on your system.  
 I found "The Forever War" a forever let-down. Considering all the hype and the Hugo and Nebula awards, I would have expected much better.  The main complaint is the irrelevant ending.  We get to know and care about characters, and follow their thorny path along the plot, wonder where they go, and who they will become at the end of the story, and then !BLAM-O!  We get an ending--a sappy, car crash, too pat ending--that had nothing to do with the previous 34 chapters. In business, we would call this fraud; in law, breach of contract.  This slipshod ending is either do to Haldeman's artistic ability, or it is a reflection of his worldview.  It cannot be the first--Haldeman has that rare flair to mix science with narrative, which makes for top notch sci-fi.  (His use of time dilation is a masterstroke) Therefore I think it comes from his worldview, which, like most people of his generation, was hastily generalized by the events of the late 1960's and early 1970's.   To paraphrase Jack London, I got the feeling that his generalizations (like many of his generation) were made between the Summer of Love and the Fall of Saigon, and he had failed to revise them since then.  So is this a critique of Heinlein's book "Starship Troopers" or a critique of Nam?  I go back and forth with this novel.  It does serve to temper Heinlein's idealism--the "if men were angels" problem--but it also serves to normalize (or at least desensitize) madcap behavior.  In this way, the book is a less funny "Catch-22" or a cosmic "Caine Mutiny."  Of course Heinlein, as a non-combat servicemen, knew how sailors talked and drank and did AHEM, but his book is clearly didactic, while Haldeman's is merely descriptive.  Even so, I felt manipulated.  All the career servicemen were jingoistic warmongers; all the conscripted NCOs were morally pure victims.  And calling some of the aliens "teddy bears" was cheap saccharine.  Additionally, there is the prepubescent glee in transforming Heinlein's juvie into an adult novel--complete with adult situations, adult language, and rampant adultery.  The chapters (especially the earlier ones) were formulaic:  1.	They are given new orders that do not make any sense. 2.	Something goes wrong with the irrational orders. 3.	S.N.A.F.U. 4.	Mandella and a female NCO have AHEM.  The characters had no motivation, just passive shoulder shrugging. In this sense they are not protagonists, just placeholders who use sex as escape.  In turn, the genetically altered post-humans become homosexual, so even that one release is removed.  Unlike Augustine, Thomas Aquinas or Galahad, once Mandella becomes chaste, he never became interesting.  "My strength is as the strength of ten/Because my heart is pure."  Even so, Haldeman doe illustrate some important flaws with conscription, casual drug use, casual sex, government solipotence, government deception.  (Keeping in mind that all of these go hand-in-hand). Furthermore, the book may have been helpful in the post-Vietnam era, as a release and a reaffirmation of what just happened.  If it is, then the book looses it's relevancy in the current conflagration. There is no miscommunication and no misunderstanding the terrorists. 
 This album is disgusting. No musical talent.  This people are the farthest thing from musicians.  If you enjoy overproduced music, and a rip off of fellow label mates FOB and P!ATD - buy this.  It is boring and it is a weak attempt at a record.  Shaant can't sing either.  Go back to Buffalo 
 The book does nothing but make a lie of itself. There's no leftwinger that hates America contrary to what rightwing propagandists try to tell you. You can't keep complaining about Michael Moore and Dan Rather for being dishonest while at the same time trying to defend nazis such as Rush Limbaugh and Dan Flynn. Folks, you cannot complain about the left hating America when the undeniable reality is the rightwing engaging in unilateral economic disarmament and allowing China and other facist and communist nations to control America's economy and pretty much everything else of it 
 The new iPods do not have the connections to work with FireWire. So this cable will only charge the new iPods with video. Besides this this is a good product for the iPods 
 I purchased this DVD and it was scratched to hell. It will not play without continuously skipping 
 I mostly liked this author before, but it *seems* that this author has taken to writing "Customer Reviews" of his/her? own works!  That's pretty darn lame.  He/she should at least acknowledge their status as author in the review, if they had any integrity 
 What happened ?  Ice Cube is my favorite rapper of all time!  For anyone else this would have been 3 stars, but this is a real disappointment to me persoanlly.  If you like the older HARD hitting Ice Cube and NWA I would try one of his earlier releases.  Who knows though... I love plenty of CDs that I hated at first 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 Well, if you are a Neanderthal guy with no experience at all on comunnication with people on your own species, buy this book RIGHT NOW. On other hand, if you are even a little polite and educated this book will not tell you anything new. Anyway, if you are looking to increase your comunicattion skills, you could use one or two pages of the whole book. I think that it is too litle for 200 more pages.It is up to you 
 I feel bad rating this book so low but I also don't want to rate it higher because I hate this book. The only reason why I read this book was because I had to read it for my english class at school. If it wasn't for the class there is absolutely no way I would have read this book. the teachers thought that we should read a civil war novel for english because were doing a civil war unit in social studies. Before we even started the novel I thought we were doing plenty of civil war, but no we have to do even more civil war. I probably wouldn't have such a hard time with this book if I didn't have to do school work with. I had such a hard time understanding some parts of this book because the family had so many people in it. I struggled to read this book every night not only because it was boring, but because I had to try to understand it so I could do the work that went with it. The only thing that happens in this book is in the begging the civil war is about to start and then some people from this family fight in the war and then they write letters to the family. Thats litteraly the only thing that happens in this book. In my opinion this book was boring and I would not recomend reading it, unless you really want to because you have nothing else to do 
 Easy exercises for the neophyte, but nothing here to challenge or enlighten someone with some exposure to yoga, tai chi or chi gung. If the term "new age psycho-babble" is in your vocabulary, you are not the type who would appreciate this book 
 I'm pretty new in the trading world also but I have to go with the crowd and say that this was the absolute worst book ever on day trading. Whatever you do, don't buy this one! Get a toni turner book or something, but NOT this one. Alot has changed since 1999 so it's understood how some techniques can't be used anymore, but this was garbage even back then.   He repeats everything hundreds of times throughout the book, "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread" "exploit bid-ask spread"  "you are the middleman" "you are the middleman"  In a bookstore read the first page of the foreword, it says that he was signed the book deal(1st one) even before he wrote it as a 23 year old. Proof enough that it's hot garbage 
 I think that this is the worse written book out of her whole series.  It repeats itself soooo many times that you can skip paragraphs without missing anything. The writing style is not consistant with her other books in the series and almost seems that a different person wrote each paragraph. One of many inconsistancies that I found in this book was the conversion from human to Carpathian.  In all the other books it states that it take 3 blood transfers to convert - in this one it states 4.  And I just wanted to yell at Alex and tell her to get over it already - the vampire had almost converted her completely anyway. And also during the conversion it states that Alex threw up the tainted vampire blood, yet she had just taken blood from Aiden and they are supposed to be able to push the toxins out of their pores - not throw it up after a day has passed since the first vampire exchange.  I've read 9 of the books, but not in order and couldn't wait to read Aiden's story, but I am VERY dissapointed in this one.  It was so poorly written that I would have given it 0 stars if it was possible.  If you like strong females - I suggest reading Dark Destiny.    
 This book is not very good and it doesn't have any good baby names in it. It's lame. 
 This is the worst lp in recording history.  The covers are embarassingly bad, and especially their cover of Lou Reed's "Sweet Jane" which is down right hideous and I'd be suprised if Lou Reed wouldn't beat the living daylights out of all three of these losers if he ever saw them.  If you think Grand Funk Railroad covering the Stones' "Gimmie Shelter" was ridiculous, that's nothing; this is far, far worse.  As for their big hit single, "Smoking in the Boys' Room" here's a newsflash:IT'S a NOVELTY song, nothing more.  The rest of the songs are "me wanna hump you" caveman songs ineptly play that make Bad Company sound sophisticated.  I'm sorry Cub Koda died young, but there is a silver lining in that cloud: HE'S NOT RECORDING ANYMORE.  Rated 1 Star because ZERO wasn't available.  Avoid at all costs.  Unless you want a ten dollar mini frisbee that comes with a jewel case 
 This is by far the worst book I have ever read.  It is dull, boring, and you don't even have a clue as to what is going on until about the 20th chapter (and it only has 22 chapters) 
 This collection of short essays he published in an English paper (and meant for an English audience) seem to miss the mark for American readers.  It's as if he published this because he needed money.  There was nothing original in this book, nothing really funny and what few authentically funny parts there were seemd trite and at times exaggerated.  I got tired of this book half-way through and gave up 
 When I picked this book up, I expected it to be interesting.  As a fat kid, I thought I would enjoy the story, thinking that I would feel connected to the main character.  Boy, was I wrong.  In the beginning of the book, Troy, feeling suicidal, wants to throw himself on the tracks, but Curt, a skinny druggie, stops him.  By the middle of the book, I wish Curt had just held back and let Troy jump.  The book was very slow for me; each new chapter sounded like the last.  I read this short book over two weeks because I just couldn't take it.  The end was unsurprisingly predictable.  I mean, I could've told you what was going to happen by the fifth chapter.  Usually, when I read a book, I take something from it, maybe a lesson or a moral.  In this book, I just felt a sense of nonclosure... the ending didn't really do it for me.  Based on the other reviews on this page, you probably think that I'm just a mean person who writes scathing reviews on great books.  The first part may be true, but I only write scathing reviews on things I did not particularly like.  You may not have liked Macbeth, but I sure did.  Whether it's a good book or not is all a matter of opinion 
 I wanted to cry when I put this book down because I miss the Danielle Steele that wrote 'Thurston House', 'Family Circle' and others.  For years now I have felt that she is simply putting out books because she is contractually obligated to by her publishers.  I really feel like her heart just isn't in it anymore.  She has become very idiosyncratic and predictable.  Every book has her main character 'being honest.' I keep reading because I am a loyal Danielle Steele fan and I write this in hopes she'll read it and either decide she is writing because she loves it (like she once did) or decide to retire and let us love her through her earlier works.  This book was just awful.  
 I had a 1GB Titanium Sandisk Cruzer at work fail.  I tried several times to contact Sandisk, including through the selling vendor with absolutely no response.  My wife's Cruzer just failed as well (the power light comes on, it is recognized by XP, and the light goes out, the system can't ID the device, so it's useless.  It does the same thing on all of the XP systems in our house).  I've tried front side USB connections, rear connections and hub connections.  No dice.    I'll never buy another Sandisk Cruzer.  And I was going to order another 100 for the office.  Their loss 
 I purchased this vcr/dvd based on the fact that it wasn't the most expensive one and it wasn't the cheapest either.  As soon as I took it out of the box I was unhappy.  It is a featherweight.  It does not play any of my VHS tapes that I had previously taped on my old VCR.  The tracking is off and you can't fix it manually.  I dislike the remote - the control buttons for which unit you are controlling are hard to find - buried in the middle of the all the buttons.  There is no volume control or easily identifiable tracking buttons on the remote. The stop button is also the rewind button, and it kept doing the opposite of what I was trying to make it do.  The channel changing number buttons are small and not easy to use because of their low position on the remote.  Overall I was quite unhappy with my purchase and am taking it back to the store 
   The questions in the theoretical exams do not reflect what you will find on the actual test. If you use this book alone to prepare, there is a good chance you will fail the exam. In general, the questions will help you to grasp some fundamentals, but you will need to go over some more realistic test questions to prepare 
 This book explains how to cover up bad points about yourself, and how do deal with personal or illegal questions, but certainly gives  very few good answers to help win a job.  There are plenty of better interview books out there 
 This movie was just about the worst movie I ever saw... so utterly and painfully pointless, and not the slightest bit funny. Tom Green makes a complete fool of himeself. I actually turned off the movie half-way through because it was so stupid... Don't waste your time or money on this one! 
 I was informed in October that the item was no longer available and my account would be credited. I think maybe I should check my bank statement for that time 
 I want to start off by saying I am a huge fan of Little's works and have amassed a collection of his books. He is an author who will go the road less traveled and I am all for that.  With this in mind I looked at the synopsis on the back cover and opted to give it a try. Bad Mistake!  Don't get me wrong, I found myself interested in Bob's dilemma, though a bit confused as to how he got that way, and was hanging on to every word in order to satisfy my curiousity as to how Bob, the book's protagonist, dealt with these challenges and waiting to see if it would get any worse for him. It did and I sympathized at first.  When the book starts it's downhill slide, in my opinion, is when he meets up later on with characters who are having similar problems. I spent the remaining time reading the book,not out of enjoyment, but wondering to myself as to how many different ways are they going to rehash their plight, causing my sympathy level to ebb as the situations go from the ridiculous to the sublime. For instance, towards the end, a full scale invasion on the  White House complete with tanks and ammunition,with only a small blurb mentioned of it on the TV news.It is illogical in it's premise only by making his characters literally undefinable by any action they take no matter how atrocious!  Anyway, out of respect for Mr. Little please pick up "The Policy" instead, not only do you care how they resolve the issue, but you get a few cheap laughs as well 
 Excellent GPS goes from car to bike to handheld easily. Easy to use I wish I had this on my last crosscountry trip. 
 Nothing distinquishes this book from other books I looked at. I had installed a wireless network for four computers at home and had endless trouble - this book was no help at all.  To be fair I should point out that no other book was helpful to me either. It's full of jargon that accumulates very quickly so that after two chapters you can't remember what you 'learned' at the beginning.  Explanations are terse and leave you feeling stupid since you feel, of course, I should be understanding the book -after all its for dummies - but you don't.  I fear the void of good material for home networkers is still to be filled 
 Had I wanted 300 pages of Duke propagana, I would have purchased their basketball media guide.  Coach K's self love has never been more evident.     Coach should stick to what he does best: ruining the careers of McDonald's All-Americans 
 I wish that everyone can get the informations he need easly especialy that improve the humanity.I'm veterinary medicine doctor work in poultry ,broilers,layers and parentstock.Always searching for the update informations.I found Amazon a good source of information for books.I love reading books, I used to bay and read at least 2 to 3 books in a month. When I'm searching in your sites sometimes I found myself puzzled which book to read or to get .I have my own library that provid me with many basic sciences and diferent subjects,dictionaries.I believe that the man must keep on reading and reading to the last day in his life.I do believe that the man is what the books he read and still reading.The books man raed is the masterkey in his life ,it will open new windows in his life.Man put part of him in each book he print 
 This book contains case studies from various data mining software. It does not contain any specific theory or practical examples for implementing a web analytics strategy for your site.  90% of the case studies he uses in his book are related to companies which their sites no longer exist.   I find this book very outdated and the examples the author use are related to visits on site, their age and country of origin. He doesn't mention anything about visitor site navigiation, trends or anything related to the visitor behaviour on site.  I wish i never bought this book because it costed me $80 due to courrier fees.  
 Just what the world needs - someone writing a book on information that has not been fully researched on the subject of transgender.  A 'drag queen' does or does not mean or represent that 1 + 1 = 2.  Not all 'drag queens' are homosexxual.  Period.  Purchase a different book that has been resarch with today's information - not this one. 
 The most disappointing part of this book is its blatant political slant.  The book is NOT about a theory of leadership, but about an ideological judgement of the performance of leaders.  Heifetz starts by insisting that leadership is necessarily tied to values because if you disagree....then the rest of his book is meaningless.  Heifetz believes that to be a good leader you have to adopt positions that he advocates and if you don't, then you aren't a good leader.  So, in Heifetz's world, Reagan wasn't a good leader, but LBJ was.    Do yourself a favor and keep surfing... 
 I had high hopes for this book, with the description on the inside dustjacket mentioning George RR Martin's A Song of Ice & Fire... NOT. It started well enough I guess, but man o man, did it get convoluted, hard to follow, and boring QUICK. The plot seemed to concern a place called Sunnashiven and how a bunch of angry peasants rise up in revolt under the command of some lordly person who is actually acting under orders from some even more powerful lordly person... To tell ya the truth, I don't even really know - it was such complicated dry boring reading that I didn't have the patience to try to comprehend it all. I got almost halfway thru it before I decided to return it. I liked the idea of an EVIL cleric as the hero... but it was so terribly boring and hard to understand that I didn't even get to the part where he decides to turn evil - and the totally lame name of Llewelyn didn't help. I commend Karen Michaelson for her attempt, but I can only say that she needs to try again - though I will not be along for the ride on the next one. This confirms that women who can write good fantasy are few and far between... Margaret Weis I enjoyed when I was younger, and Robin Hobb more recently. That's it. If you want to read some really good fantasy, read George RR Martin and Guy Gavriel Kay 
 Don't bother with this book.  It's big and bulky and good for nothing. The cover claims it contains "Listings for 94 national and regional restaurant chains," which would (and did) lead one to believe that, along with basic generic food stuff, it would include the majors along with regional minors. NOT! Taco Cabana (?) is here, but no Taco Bell, no Taco Bueno.  And good luck finding ANY listing for a hamburger bun.  Get the current year's edition of *the Calorie King's Calorie, Fat & Carbohydrate Counter.* <-It's small, convenient, and tells the dieter everything you need to know without a bunch of drek you don't./TundraVision, Amazon reviewer 
 I couldn't go three pages without running into something that was sloppy, incomplete, or just plain irritating.  Full of many good examples that back up the book's main idea (using lessons of history to guide current decision-making), the book unfortunately is also full of hyperbole, flawed argument, inaccurate generalizations and over-simplifications.    It's easy to show how the lesson of a historical incident can validate a decision, if you ignore all interpretations of that historical incident except those which confirm the decision you're trying to support.  Tautologies are convenient, but they prove nothing.  A little more precision, a little more discipline, and the thesis of the book would have been a lot more convincing.  Even worse than that: too often, the author asserts controversial opinions as though they were accepted fact; too often over-generalizes to the point of meaninglessness; too often slips from chatty informality into factual inaccuracy.    I really, really wanted to respect this book, because I am always looking for works that synthesize the lessons of many different historical periods.  The idea behind this book was intriguing, which is why the poor execution of that idea is so disappointing.   
 Since "Ragtime" I have followed faithfully Brian's career with every play in New York, TV guest apppearances, concert at Kennedy Center, etc.  I love his talent.  What a huge disappointment his CD was for me.  It was too "nightclubish"--too slow-too nothing.  I heard it once and gave it to a friend.  She now wants to give it back.  Brian, return to the deep voice, booming notes. Please 
    Lets be honest, no one really likes this band. Its all bandwagon, afraid of appearing stupid and unadventurous nonsense. If tame punk with Geddy Lee(of Rush great band)meets Diamanda Galas(great singer and composer) vocals is your cup of tea then by all means pick this up. But please there is far too much interesting music out there to waste your time with this. Check out Ash Ra Tempel, Robbie Basho, Scratch Acid, Boris, Dalek, and Borbetomagus instead 
 Don't buy this book, unless you are heavily interested in literary theory, linguistics and/or semiotics.  This is not a history book nor a book on history, but rather a linguistic and literary interpretation of some accounts of the conquest of America.  Further, the book is biased.  It does not discuss the truth of the matters asserted in the early conquest accounts and there is barely any criticism and analysis of the reliability of those sources.  Get instead a Prescott if you want to know what the conquest was all about 
 I should qualify this review by stating that I am not an expert on the subject of improvement.  This book will not make you or even guide you to expertise.  The only shining concept within the book, PDSA, is a great format for structuring improvement within a company, but could have been summed up successfully in 20 pages or less.  BOOKS SHOULD NOT SPEND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THEIR VOLUME ADVERTISING THEMSELVES 
 I once had a cheap shaver I got at Sears that I learned was made for Sears by Remington. I liked that shaver, so when I found the R-950 at Sears on sale for $40, I decided to replace my old top-selling-brand rotary shaver. Big mistake. After 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck (especially with drier winter skin), not to mention the occasional cut lip I get with the R-950 while trying to shave around the mouth, I am going back to my old shaver. How can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave... but it does. 
 fast reading, well written.. 
 This is one of the most uninteresting novels I have ever read.  There was nothing in the whole book that was worth reading.  The characters are so 1 dimensional that from the get go you can see through them all and wish you weren't reading the book.  I finished the novel, just to see if it ever redeems itself.  Please don't waste your time 
 I have read all of Marcia Muller's books and this one was certainly a let down.  During the past 2 weeks I got Listen to the Silence, Both Ends of the Night and this one out of the library.  The other 2 were great - I devoured them, but I couldn't get past page 50 of this one.  Will return it to the library unfinished today.  Thank goodness I am aware of Muller's REAL potential and don't have to judge her by this book 
 Hobsbawm's metaphysical system, communism, ultimately denies national sentiment.  So we can expect, and we do indeed receive, considerable attempts throughout the book to diminish, degrade and put down nationalism -- everything from the anti-intellectual argument that nationalism only began when the word "nation" appeared, to an exegesis of its evils in the 20th century.  This bias is made worse by high-handed, hypocritical lecturing at the end of the first chapter about how the social scientist is supposed to be "objective."  Phffft!  Eric is one of the last people in the world to lecture us on objectivity 
 This is Arnolds fakiest film.  I mean, a demigod?  I can't believe this at all...fakiest film.  Yes Arnold is in peak condition in this film, but his other films are simply a little easier to swallow...come on Arnold, no one talks back to Zeus 
 All this new magazine is is a glossy ad for makeup and clothes. I can't even get my subscription delivered and there is no phone number ANYWHERE to contact customer service.  Don't waste your money unless you love Paris Hilton 
 Wow--what a downer.  We watched three unlikeable characters spiral downward into an abyss of hopelessness and despair for over two hours, and it wasn't worth it in the end.  There's no redemption here, no hope of change, no learning on the part of any character.  I'd say more, but there really isn't much more to tell.  I'd never consider watching this film again, and I would recommend it to no one 
 I'll give this book a well deserved 2 stars for showing the identical patterns of a passive-agressive man. They make it all your fault, and refuse to take responsibility for their own words or actions, everything is blamed on you, their stories are twisted with convenient amnesia over events that happened, and you begin to wonder if you are losing your mind, or if there is something wrong that YOU did!  NO, there is nothing wrong with YOU, and the part of this book that is completely missing is how to GET AWAY from a PA man, rather, it tells you to stay with it. Sure, just hang in there and go insane! No Way! I lived this issue, "accomodating" the other person, forgiving, allowing it all to go over my head, only to find myself feeling like I was going insane!  I recommend this book to see the signs if perhaps you are a parent, or a relative, but there is nothing you can do to heal a PA, they have to get professional help and heal themselves!  It's NOT your job to "hang in there" as this book suggests. It is your job to get out of the relationship to save whatever sanity you might have left!   There are other books out there that can help you with finding the courage to see it all, and positively do something about it, just read my reviews for that.   You can see the signs, and when you do, don't waste another moment of your life only to make yourself feel even worse day after day, get out of the relationship and give yourself the permission to make the fresh start that you deserve!   
 I have read all of the books up until this one, and this one is definitely the worst so far.  In fact, it makes me wonder whether I will continue to read the series.  The book is misnamed.  The Ionian mission is only the last fourth of the book.  The first three-fourths is a very boring description of two battles that came close to happening but never did.  The Ionian mission itself is fairly confusing with all of the personal names and place names bandied about.  Jack Aubrey, as in most of the other books, is burdened with an extremely difficult mission.  He must decide who to support in some kind of three-way civil war.  He makes the wrong choice, but then is called away to fight another party who has seized some British vessels.  Talk about deus ex machina!  There is nothing of much interest that happens in this book.  Stephen Maturin doesn't really do anything interesting in the espionage line, and Professor Graham is a bore.  The final battle scene is as predictable as most of the others--Jack Aubrey wins against all odds because he is a good captain.  I recommend skipping this one if you are reading through the series.  I would bet that Patrick O'Brian did not spend very much time writing this.  In fact, it seemed like bits and pieces patched together to form a "novel. 
 THis book was horrible.  If it was possible to rate it lower than one star i would have.  I am an avid reader and picked this book up after my mom had gotten it from a friend.  I read half of it, suffering from a headache the entire time, and then got to the part about the relationship the 13 year old boy had with a 33 year old man and i lit this book on fire.  One less copy in the world...don't waste your money.  I wish i had the time spent reading this book back so i could use it for better purposes.  THis book wasted my life 
 I am going to be the lone voice in the wilderness... I could not get into this book, could not make it past the first thirty pages.  The narrative voice rambles from first person to third person, often it is not clear what is going on...  I think this is a challenging book and most certainly is not a novel for somebody who is looking for a light read 
 I read this to review it for a print publication. I kept wondering why the translators bothered to put it into English and why the publishers felt that it was worth the sacrifice of trees. I think it   may have value as aversive therapy for compulsive readers 
 Barbara Caruso is a very minor Broadway actress.  A book of this caliber deserves the best.  The publisher should have stopped pinching pennies and hired Marian Seldes, a true Broadway star 
 Yes, this is a pretty good review book.  It has drugs stuffed into tables, and even includes some good text in the chapters.  Unfortunately, there just isn't enough info in the book for a pharm class or a USMLE review.  Run and buy Lippincotts if you want the best pharm book on Earth.  Ridiculously simple, has alot of great books but this really isn't one of them.  It is ok but really isn't all that useful.  GO BUY LIPPINCOTTS NOW....Believe me that will make your pharm experience simple as it can be 
 This book is a two-ring circus of patent, irresponsible foolishness.  But this is the con artist's game.  They fly their paper demons in the face of science.  Anything but embrace the contradictions, complexities and subtleties of the universe.  Carl Sagan was right, "They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at the Wright brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown." The baloney-detector is pinning in the red.  Don't believe a word of this hallucinated drivel 
 Here's the deal:  Janet Evanovich is writing for the money.  The series hit its climax at To the Nines. Ten Big Ones was a disappointment, and Eleven on Top had none of the fun its racy title promised.   The Barnaby series are manufactured pop romps (though I'll still read them), and are bound to burnout soon.   The thing is, I think Evanovich knows this. I think she understands that her writing style has become stale, trite, and disappointing. Looking for inspiration, she has turned back to her early work.  Evanovich published 10+ wonderful suspense/mystery/action/ROMANCE novels that pop up on Ebay occasionally. I've read some of them, and they really are quite fun. Even better, she is rereleasing them for the mass audiences.   Anyway, the first of these books was Full House. She repackaged this with fairly disappointing conclusions, but continued the series with (in the wrong order) Full Tilt, Full Blast, Full Speed, and now, Full Bloom.  These novels were fun, exciting, silly, and fresh. This may be because Evanovich teamed up with Charlotte Hughes. Anywhichway, with Full Bloom, Evanovich has slipped back into her old writing style: the twenty page setup, the quick burnout, and two hundred extra pages of nothing.   I ended up skimming the end part of this book, and it was still slow and painful. Try and guess the mystery by reading the summary! You probably will. Try the other Full series, and get her old romances: The Rocky Road to Romance, Love Overboard, and Back to the Bedroom 
 A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.   In the end I was very disappointed.  Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude.  He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?  Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have no desire to read any more of his books 
 Movie Boring... Story Drags... barely any action... if story drags should have atleast good story to keep interest but it had nothing... booo 
 They look nice, but they're badly put together; I had to re-sew all of the fingers within the first month 
 I can hardly find words to describe this work.  Vacuous comes to mind with little effort.  The entire time I read this, I thought, where's the research?  Save yourself a buck: Think different like Richard Branson 
 This is the only math book I've ever had and for just about every lesson, I have to go searching on the internet to comprehend whatever I'm studying.  I basically use the book as a marker to see where the teacher is at, and what type of problems we are on. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has experience tough problems with math in the past.  If you must get this book, get some type of companion book with it to help you better understand 
 Now where's the old John Stossel who stood up for consumers against sleazy scams perpatrated by corrupt businesses? Guess he thought it's better to steal all the taxpayer money than to fight for taxpayer justice. For all his ramblings in this book, he might as well blabber on the Emmy Awards and get lost ! Let's see how this clown fares when the public lion wakes up and tears his ligaments to shreds  
 The book is detailed and the guy obviously knows what he is talking about but that is little help for someone who is trying to understand the concept's and practicality of what is being put forward. Save your money and buy "Visual Basic 6 Business Objects" by WROX 
 Not exactly what I thought but has some insight into fun, pleasure and facing the world with a positive attidude. 
 Like many others, the arm on my 4 year olds excavator broke as well  Who can we contact for help?  There is NO information on the box 
 This is the 2nd time Amazon has sent the wrong tape and blamed it on me.  I ordered the original Alan Rickman british edition and received the VERY BAD US edition - when returning it, I was tolf that I ordered the wrong thing!!!  I still have the order acknowledgement showing purchase of the Rickman edition - someone never read what was ordered and returns do not show an option of wrong tape received.  Good By Amazo 
 If this book is meant as an intro to critical thinking for someone going into philosophy, it's a complete disaster.  The reason is simple: it's entirely too sloppy.  This is evident from the very first chapter, and I'll restrict my examples to this one section.  First, the authors misuse standard terms in philosophy like 'valid' and 'essential'.  Second, they consistently make category mistakes (e.g. they suggest that 'ideas' can be 'right').  Third, they make patently false claims (e.g. "Belief alone--without good whys--can't help us get one inch closer to the truth" (page 3) This is silly, of course they can--they need only be true!).    Finally, and most embarrasingly, they make poor inferences--in fact invalid ones.  The book is loaded with *non sequiturs*.  For example, they suggest that if any of a given series of propositions is true (though they sloppily call them 'ideas'), then "knowing anything about anything is impossible" (5).  This doesn't follow from a number of the propositions in the list, one of which is the claim that "There's no such thing as objective reality," and another of which is "There are spiritual, mystical, or inner ways of knowing that are superior to our ordinary ways of knowing."  Why the affirmation of either of these propositions entails the claim that knowing anything about anything is impossible is beyond me.  Later in the chapter they tackle the proposition that there is no such thing as objective truth.  They wrongly infer that this means that "reality is whatever each of us believes it to be" and that if this is true then "there could be no such thing as knowledge" (page 5) two claims that an intro to philosophy student should be able to see don't follow from the mere assertion that truth is not objective.  Frankly, I'm tired of fixing the text when I present it to students.  If you are interested in becoming a more careful thinker, and especially if you're interested in becoming a better epistemologist and philosopher, don't waste your time with this volume.  The only reason it warrants two stars is that there is some material that's of interest to a lay person who will not have the need to have a philosophical understanding of concepts like validity, soundness, categories, etc 
 I purchased my version of El Hazard from a zShop for 19 bucks and I am SO glad that I did. That said, the first series is worth watching for two main reasons: overt lesbianism and Jinnai. The former is self-explanatory while the latter (Jinnai) is without a doubt the best character in the series (despite the fact that he is the antagonist). You can't say that any of the characters are very deep or well developed, but throughout the first series Jennai is by far the most satisfyingly fleshed-out character, as well as the most ammusing and true to his nature. This superiority is all the more appearant when he is contrasted with story's main character who is shallowly developed and in no way engaging. And this is what makes the second series (all four dismal episodes) so tragic: they nerfed Jinnai. He could never have been called a genius in the first series, but he was decidedly intelligent, cool, pragmatic, supremely self-confident and an effective leader (even though he was also manic and delusional). In El Hazard II, as if in response to the world recoiling at the sight of a humorous though competent villain, they have turned Jinnai into a slapstick-idiot persuing his increasingly nebulous ambition with foolish abandon. I suggest purchasing El Hazard through...alternate means,... watching the first series and discarding the second. Let's face it: even lesbian humor gets old when the writing sucks and the characters are empty 
 This book's description sparked my interest and led me to think that it would fill a gap in Eliot scholarship. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The book does not quite achieve what it sets out to do 
 Comon people listen to some music with soul and meaning.  Buy Guns 'N Roses Use your Illusion albums.  They rock and they'll blow you away musically.  They have guys who play their own instruments in it, and play them very well.  Please don't let music like this reign the charts anymore.  It is a scam by the record companies for them to make s**tloads of money.  They give you this sleek "appealing" commercial trash used to fool you and get YOUR MONEY!!!  These guys are not musicians!  Please listen to real music.  Their are starving musicians everywhere around the world who deserve to get paid before these little droids do.  
 The idea is fantastic.  The fact is I don't wake up immediately like BZZZZ--I'm awake.  Amazingly I can hit the snooze on a regular alarm without ever knowing it.  On this alarm, the light starts glowing and gets brighter and brighter over a period of time you select.  I have mine set for 15 minutes, and usually by the time the light has reached maximum I'm coherent enough to get up.  If the light doesn't do it, you can add sounds ranging from a buzzer to screeching sea gulls--ocean, wind, and ringing bells falling somewhere in between.  The flaws:    As others have mentioned, the light itself makes a buzzing noise at low light levels.  So when it first pops on in the morning, you also get the annoying filiment vibration of the lamp.    Secondly, you don't set the alarm for when you want to get up.  You have to go through some math calculations, figuring out when you WANT to wake up and how long it will take you to get to that point.  Then you set the alarm for that earlier time (awake minus groggy equals alarm time).    Third, if you use the sound in addition to the light, it does increase in volume as the light increases in intensity, but the sound starts out so loud to begin with that the light is really pointless.  A workaround we've found for this is to use the external speaker provided.  Plug it into the back of the light, run it across the room, and bury it upside down under some pillows.  Then pick a sound like "Birds" instead of the lip-curling "Harbor" or "Town".  From it's buried location across the room, the sound hits the right volume about the time the light maxes out.  Whoever came up with the plan of making the sound come on with the light was just not thinking.    Fourth, the clock lumination can change colors, rotating through the entire rainbow all night long in its default setting.  At first that looks cool.  Until you realize a bright yellow clock glowing in your face at 2 a.m. is just wrong.  The darkest setting is red, and the only way to choose it is to hit a pause button on the back when it rotates around to that color.  So yes, it works.  And it wakes me up without making me use my hammer.  But the design is just plain stupid.  If the manufacturer would wander by here, read this and make a few design changes, they could make a light worth buying 
 In fairness this is a guide to literary agents.  No doubt.  The catch is the premise that from this book one can pitch his or her's manuscript. Well the pitch can be made but it will not be read.  You will get your response with a dear john "your project" card.  (They cannot even find the time to write down the title of your book.)  Why is this?  Why do the agents allow their names' and adresses' in these books.  It's vanity, all vanity.  Now they have a new gimmick.  It's advice.  "I'm too busy, have too many clients anyhow, have you tried Writer's Market???  That's the kiss off.  Er, please never send me anything again.  A few will actually mention that the three chapters that they requested in their advertising blurb and you sent them were disposed of unread.  So what to do?  Call them up.  Call'em.  Find out if they want to read your stuff or not.  Better yet get on a program of meeting agents and editors.  This is all about money, not creativity.  Maybe you can bribe a credible editor  (not an agent) to read your work. (I know everybody tells you not to do this.) Sometimes you have to succomb to extream measures.  You're a creator, be creative. But save your copying dough and your envelopes and the postage and the time and give these agents a call.  If they don't have time to take your call they certainly dont have time to read your stuff.  Be tough.            
 The whole novel should have centralized on Firekeeper's story.  The plot was complicated with ridiculous characters and kingdoms you don't even find out about until three-quarters through the novel.  I kept having to refer back to see how the heck these people were related and who the heck they were.  The beginning of THROUGH WOLF's EYES is wonderful, engrossing,  and exciting.   But once they get to court, you want to dump the book on the nearest coffee table from frustration and boredom. It really, and I mean really, gets nutty talking about a million characters you don't know, can't understand who they are, and don't care a chit about. Get back to the protagonist please!?    The whole war was half-hearted and not compelling at all.  All I cared about as a reader was what was to become of Firekeeper, was the real Lady Blysse really dead, would Holly find out who Firekeeper really is....  and who was Blind Seer really, a royal wolf?  The author NEVER explains that one.   I love dogs of all kinds, I'm 40 years old, and I love good fantasy. Maybe I would have enjoyed this book more had I been an eighteen-year old.  It just seemed the promise the book held remained unfulfilled.  When it ended, I just held it going, "huh.".  That's it? 
 What could have been, indeed WAS, an amazing true crime story is ground out at a laboriously slow pace and Noah seems more interested in the sound of his prose than anything to do with this amazing and faascinating true story 
 This is not a novel but a collection of pointless, unrelated short stories.  Good Will Hunting it ain't.  To find out about physicists read Feyman's autobiographies or Radiance 
 The Leak-O-Matic fully lived up to its name.  As a new parent, I don't have time to do things once, forget about doing things twice.  I need simple and reliable- the Leak-O-Matic is neither.  It worked OK for the first few times, then I partially filled the tub and put all the items nearby necessary for bathtime.  By the time I returned with baby in hand, the Leak-O-Matic had dribbled all over the laundry room counter, soaked all my other items on the counter, water ran down onto the floor, under the baseboard, and dripped from the upstairs landing onto the downstairs foyer floor.  The Leak-O-Matic is the Hindenburg of all baby bathtubs.  It is too bad that I cannot give it zero stars.   There are many people who say that you just have to assemble them correctly, but judging from the number of irate mommies here, I conclude that it is either too a complicated design or just plain crappy engineering.  Think about it- the number of people with young children who took the time to go online and tell everyone that this thing is a piece of cheese!    The cups on the feet stick to the countertop so you are unable to positon the tub once it is attached.  The fabric mesh incline allows the baby to slide down into the water, so you're always repositioning the baby.  I'm surprised that this thing didn't come with a built in toaster for 'added safety'.  I did not research every single item on the registry- I figured that if the big stores carried it then it must be at least "OK".  Back it goes.  If you buy this thing, then good luck to you, and don't burn the toast! 
 In the essay on Patrick O'Brian to be found on its website, the W.W. Norton Company comments upon O'Brian's rare civility in dealings with his publisher. Certainly Norton has repaid him with an incivility perhaps even more rare by subjecting his great work, now that he is dead and unable to protest, to an editor who obviously neither reads nor understands English. Other reviewers here have enumerated the kinds of error that make almost every other page of The Complete Aubrey/Maturin Novels difficult, sometimes impossible, for a close, careful and experienced reader to decipher and will certainly leave young, less experienced readers baffled and ultimately disgusted with the works themselves. I wish only to suggest, to anyone wanting to read these novels for the first or second or hundredth time, or to give them as a gift, that he or she find another edition and avoid this one. And to suggest, also, that whoever at Norton wrote, in the O'Brian article on that website, that his publishers were sorry they would not be seeing him again, should reconsider that statement. His publishers ought to be very, very glad to be beyond the man's reach after having offered him this appalling insult. 
 I found this book a bit boring. In the beginning, the book is a little slow, and then the adventure picks up, and then slows down again at the end. I also thought that the book was on the harder side; there are lots of characters to remember and some of them have the very similar names, so sometimes it can become just a little confusing. I would not recommend this book to others because it wasn't interesting and it wasn't a page-turner. Historical-fiction lovers would probably find this to be okay though 
 If you're looking for information from the best in his field, Jeff Cooper is the go-to guy.  But DO NOT waste your money on this "book."  This is a reissue of a 1989 training presentation that Cooper developed.    While his chapter headings are good (7 principles), each "chapter" is about 2-3 pages of large print.  The entire "book"  contains only 28 pages on which there is reading material, and many of those pages are less than half full.  And Paladin Press, usually fairly competent, apparently never bothered to proofread this mess, with missing punctuation and errors such as "50-called" instead of "so-called."  I will now give you the entire book, in less than 100 words:  Here are the seven principles of successful personal defense:  - Alertness - Decisiveness - Aggressiveness - Speed - Coolness - Ruthlessness - Surprise  And the one take-home nugget of insight from this book:   All of these principles must be backed up by one's SKILL with a firearm, which requires training and practice.   "YOU ARE NO MORE ARMED BECAUSE YOU ARE WEARING A PISTOL THAN YOU ARE A MUSICIAN BECAUSE YOU OWN A GUITAR."   This one sentence inspired me to schedule some refresher training, and to set aside some additional time on a weekly basis to practice and maintain my skills.  OK, I just saved everyone about $10, plus s+h, plus the wait for it to arrive in the mail, plus the disappointment that you didn't buy one of Jeff's other books instead.   Buy a box of JHPs with good stopping power, and think of me [fondly, NOT as the imaginary target!] the next time you go to the practice range 
 I have seen many pathetic films in my life. This topped them. Did I rate one star? Sorry- I meant negative 11 stars. It was the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. It was a total waste of three hours when I could have been sleeping. There was no point. The script and storyline were pathetic. The gore was overdone- too much blood, killing, and the like. It was totally historically inaccurate, and the Civil War scenes were so grossly unrealistic that it was laughable. All Civil War veterans are rolling over in their graves. Any scene that was supposed to be touching was pathetic. One of the abolsute bombs was when Clint Eastwood fires off a canon twice with his cigar- yet he does not even load it- either time. And somehow, without even aiming the canon, he knocks his 'friend' off his horse.   The movie is a failure. F-A-I-L-U-R-E. Crappy. Junky. Just plain DUMB. STUPID. PATHETIC.  I am not going to waste any more words on it. Just....whatever you do....save your money. Don't buy it. It's not worth 50 cents 
 Normally I like the entire "female power" thing but frankly the "this is wrong" or "evil" part of that storyline is really old.  In an era where girls do try out for and get placed on "boys" teams, these issues seem outdated.  Likewise rules were recently changed in Indiana (not even slightly a liberal state) that says any pageant receiving state funds cannot discriminate on the basis of sex or gender.  I know, this book is from 1999, but we are living in a conservative backlash politically and this is still happening, changes are happening.  Overall I felt the book had a very negative view of the gender roles and did not do anything to suggest they should be different.  Even the disempowered girl who creates the initial problems with her "magic" is empowered through a pageant and her cooking.  How much more gender role enforcement can we have?  Really, with a strong female lead, shouldn't a Buffy universe story do better than this?  In general the feel of the relationships and lingo between the main characters was fine but not particularly outstanding 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 This short novel started off ok, but it was not long before my brain was awash in confusion. This is a highly abstract experimental novel that makes little if any sense. Without question the author has a wonderful vocabulary and on occasion really knows how to turn a phrase, but she doesn't seem to know how to put her natural talents to their best use. The reader never gets to know the characters (and quite frankly doesn't want to get to know them) because they are so flat--less than flat. Furthermore, the narrator does anything but narrate the story because he is always too busy calling attention to himself and the fact that he is narrating a story that no one gives a s**t about. There is no plot and the overall idea is as hopeless as they come--TRULY HOPELESS. I really wanted to like this work and I pushed on, almost against my will to finish, but all I was left with was a disappointment that bordered on downright despair. For such a slim book, this may have been one of the most cumbersome ordeals I have put myself through as of late. Simply put, there are millions of better things out there to read and I should probably note that this is the only book I have ever awarded a one star rating--this is because zero stars is not an option

 this one simply is too mediocre not even qualified being good. i've read all iles' complicated yet fasinating novels, most of them carried the weight as any great book should be except some of the endings felt lame and rushed. but this 24 hours didn't hang on in my hands and lock up my eyes' over 24 minutes, i just returned it to the library the next day and would not think about re-reading it again. the other books such as the quiet game, sleep no more, blood memory, dead sleep are all great reading experiences, his first and second ones were just too jewish focused. concentrating on the south is a trade mark of iles, although after hurricane katrina, the nopd police force seemed to be a totally ridiculous lame duck and incapable of doing anything right, not as good as what iles described in his novels. all said, this time no cigar for you, poncho 
 The End of the Hamptons is less than meets the eye. The author has done little serious research and conflates gossiip with his superficial and dated Marxism. Indeed, to suggest that the secessionist movement to create Peconic County was Marxist inspired, as he does, borders on the psychotic.   Harold Wit and I founded the Group for America's South Fork, yet the author spoke to neither of us.  He gives enormous credit to one individual, Hal Ross, who played only a minor role in the environmental movement that arose from a passion to protect the farms.  As the author of the Suffolk County Farmland Preservation Act, I  find this incredible. There is a real need for a serious study of what happened on the South Fork politically and socially, but this is not it.  Ian Marceau, who was the first director of the Group for America's South Fork, and who is lauded as a kind of saviour by the author, told everyone that he would work for the developers if they paid him more than the environmental group did. But don't look for this or any other truth in this slight and useless tract. The author's hatred of the Hamptons has its origins in the politics of resentment, which is utterly tiresome.

 First let me say that aside from any of the ideas presented, this book deserves a low rating just because of how horribly it is written.  Skinner has no real style and simply rattles of declarative sentences at such a monotonous pace that I was practically tearing my hair out at the end of the book.  And for all the mechanistic nature of his writing, he's suprisingly inept at conveying a point.  But getting to the ideas contained therein.  This book combines the very shaky "science" of behaviorism with the silliest doomsday rhetoric that was so typical of the decades following the invention of the atomic bomb.  Skinner starts off by talking about how horrible the human race has thus far managed itself, how we are in danger at any second of annihilating ourselves.  This kind of alarmism was probably very convincing in the 70s, but it hardly has any force with reasonable people today, who realize that, despite our flaws, we seem to be pretty good at surviving.  Skinner then goes into the meat of his book, which is pretty much summed up by saying, "There is no circumstance under which humans are not controlled.  It's just a matter of the form the control takes, and there's no such thing as an autonomous agent inside us.  We need to accept that and engineer the perfect society by devising ways of control that are better."  If you read those three sentences, you don't really need to read "Beyond Freedom & Dignity," but for those who are curious, I'll say a few more words, mainly criticism.  The first criticism is that, of course, Skinner just constantly and tediously repeats that it is an established scientific "fact" it is that we are purely products of the environment (whether personally or through evolution) without justifying it very well.  Paradoxically, he admits that the science of human behavior is poorly developed compared to, say, biology and physics, and in fact hasn't progressed much since Aristotle. He is oblivious to this contradiction.  On the one hand, he wants it to be certain and unquestioned that a human can be completely explained by his science.  On the other, his science is underdeveloped (because people have not accepted that it is true yet).  He seems to think that behaviorist science does not need any sophistication or development in order for it's most weighty premise--that humans have no autonomy--to be an accepted fact.  Skinner puts the cart before the horse.  The second criticism is that Skinner never really gets down to any even slightly useful details on what his Utopia will look like.  His excuse is, again, that behaviorist science is still not developed enough, I guess.  But it seems like someone who says, "We must change our culture so that it has the best possible effect on our lives" isn't really saying anything profound.  In other words, his dramatic plan for the human race reduces to nothing more than saying, "Let's do things better."  In a book of 200 pages, Skinner really doesn't give much information at all.  It's worth mentioning that after every chapter he gives a short one-paragraph summary of the ideas in that chapter.  He could have simply published those summaries and retained about 90% of the real content of his book.  Thirdly, Skinner is oblivious to the inherent contradictions in his position.  If man is just a product of his environment, with no real autonomy, no inherent ability to act in and of himself, then how can we even "plan" anything for the future?  If a superior culture does develop, it cannot be considered anything but a happy accident.  It can't even be considered "happy," since that term implies some inner agent who is happy.  I guess we would just say, "It would be favorable for the participants."  There is something just simply idiotic in saying, "We should design a better culture, because none of us have free will and are just products of our culture."  I suppose Skinner only wrote his book due to the stimulus of his environment and thus can't be blamed for the inconsistency... But the point I'm making is that in order to act for positive change, you have to feel like you have some autonomous capacity to change things.  All in all, the book is rather dated.  The idea of man as simply a machine that converts stimulus to response, with emotions and thoughts (if they exist at all) as mere side effects is absurd to anyone who does a little introspection instead of, say, studying figures on how incomes and education relate to robbery convictions.  And the doomsday scenarios that motivate the work are much less compelling (to reasonable people, at least) than they used to be.  I don't recommend this book unless you have some scholarly need to read it.  On final reflection, it appears to me as simply an attempt by Skinner to profit off the anxieties of his times rather than an earnest attempt at offering useful knowledge to mankind 
 This book seems very much like the authors' personal dating history.  For example, in talking about Libras, they launch into a story about how one of the authors was horribly treated by their Libra girlfriend, except that instead of using this as an example, they implied that everyone else's Libra girlfriend would most probably act the same way.  If you can take their specific examples with a grain of salt, on the whole the book gives some good advice.  However, if you want to have a lasting relationship after seducing someone, this is not the book to buy.  This book's advice is better for getting a one-night stand or short-lived fling.  For example, this book says that to seduce an Aries, you should make a bold first move.  This might get them into bed once or twice, but in the long run, according to nine out of ten astrology books that you picked up, this will bore them, as they need a challenge and prefer to make the first move themselves.  All in all there are some good insights in this book, but I would browse it in the bookstore instead of paying for it 
 I just didn't get it. The movie was painfully boring. The only remotely redeeming aspect was some interesting cinematography. 
 As a former hospital chaplain, mental health therapist, and one-time patient, I am greatly put off by the author's assumptions and arrogance concerning group therapy.  His attempts to "bring out" and "socialize" Highly Sensitive Personalities, Introverts and those with Schizo-social disorders borders on criminal.  Starting with p.231, the author spins a rather slanted bias in favor of extroversion, brashly assuming that introverted patients need "fixed" if they are to be productive and happy in a group therapy environment.  Such gross insensitivity and ignorance is unfortunate, misleading, and inexcusable in a scholarly text such as this. 
 This book takes the time to live up to every lie there is in the African American In the Life community.  It is a sad that this was even allowed to go to print 
 Prep was quite a good novel. The follow-up, The Man of My Dreams, is ... well, it's simply not nearly as good.   The main character has real self-esteem issues. And while I might expect them in a young woman, the length of time it takes her to deal with them is excruciating. Even when people genuinely like her, she has a very  hard time believing it. All that negativity is hard to take; a character needs to grow or there is no point in reading about them.  She does finally get a backbone, but you have to read through a whole lot of nothing to get there. And I'm not quite sure the journey was worth it 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 There is more than one way to successfully promote a product. If you find a way that has not, up to now, been incorporated into a text book, then use it as long as it works.  That is the substance of the 260 pages of the book. There a few examples, ridden to death, of underground/hippie/counter-culture advertising successes. The point of each is that the advertising was not done in the mainstream, dump a zillion bucks into TV and/or magazine ads manner.  How do you Hijack a brand? You don't. That's the whole point of the concept -- sometimes a subset of the general population will latch onto a product for its own reasons (think Doc Maartens) and propel it to success. The subset "hijacked" the brand, at least in the authors parlance. Another phrase that covers the same ground is "niche marketing." That, of course, derives from the notion of a biological niche. All the plants and animals on the planet live in a niche. How novel, to rename "niche marketing" to "Brand Hijack."  My personal good news is that I was able to read the book in about 90 minutes, minimizing the time wasted 
 Unfortunately, I checked out this book by reading only the blurb which, of course, presented a totally inaccurate picture.  Prof Wagnar may be excused for proletariat leanings since academia is the last refuge of true believers  still "waitin' for the Revolution".  (That is, if you don't count such vacation hot spots as North Korea, Vietnam or Cuba.)  It's not that the author was so wrong about the collapse of Marxist ideology - after all the CIA missed the boat - it's that he chose to assign moral, economic and political equivalence to the two worlds.    Anyone with an atom of sense knew, even in 1989, that the USSR was an economic disaster and falling fast, a third-world country bristling with nukes.  The spectacular collapsed revealed the extent of the rot in all its ugliness.   But what galled me was the lack of vision.  The "story" of technology was downright embarrassing, vague and semi sci-fi. His vision (quote unquote) was woefully inadequate.  Like many historians he became obsessed with political trends he sees or desires. Thus, we have the fall of capitalism, the spread of the Russian Empire, Marxism taken seriously fifty years from now (Russian-speak sounds like Lenin - LOL), the failure of SDI, the rise of Russia over China...needless to say, the exact opposite happened in every single case.    Some of the worst pleading concerned the various global governments he describes.  This is his real concern and goal - Earth uniting under one political banner.  For "balance" he makes a Latino, woman president start WWIII killing (he breezily reports) about 5.8 billion after which the world unites and does great things.  Obvious questions arise - with the technological heart cut out (the West and particularly the US) how does Africa or South America suddenly develop this great technology? The book ends quickly - we build big spaceships, roar to the stars and find evidence of "archeological discoveries" near the star Procyon.  Yeah, right. My grade - F-. 
 I can't believe how many reviewers are giving Roddy McDowall accolades for his performance in this monstrosity. Out of all of the shortcomings this movie has, its biggest one is the miscasting of Roddy McDowall in a tough-guy role. I couldn't help but laugh every time he was on the screen, because I couldn't believe a scrawny, short guy with impeccably-pronounced British English in the role of a tough, Old West cowboy. I'm not a macho brute by any means, but when I watch a Western, I want true (actually, make that typical Hollywood formula) cowboys and action.  Other reviewers have rightly mentioned that the plot is a bit thin; it's so thin that you can see right through it. Robert Mitchum was a good actor, and he did the best job in this film even though his character was also poorly written. As for Dean Martin, I never did think he was much of a cowboy actor; he did okay in both "Rio Bravo" and "The Sons of Katie Elder," but it didn't hurt that those were star vehicles for John Wayne; without the Duke, Dino didn't fare as well in Westerns.  The only way they could have made this stinker of a movie entertaining would have been to have Roddy McDowall riding around in an ape costume with an ammo belt draped over his shoulder and a rifle in his hand (I know, I know - he was a 'good' ape). I'm not sure whether this movie or "Planet of the Apes" came out first (both were released in 1968), but that would have made a funny tie-in with "...Apes", and it wouldn't have been any more ludicrous than any of the things that are already in "Five Card DUD" 
 One expects pictures in a cook book especially if you are looking to learn something new. It's hard know if it is not something you would like to prepare without a presentation. If you are very experienced at cooking great it has lots of pages of text, but I found it useless in helping me with vegetarian cooking. Sorry if it sounds so trivial, but a cookbook with out pictures is no darn good to me. If you disagree, good luck it has lots of pages for you 
 Its a low level polemic against social sciences. The author holds up evolution to explain modern human societys. Something between Wilson and "The bell curve" His knowledge about social sciences is not funded.. 
 I purchased the book on Jul. 23, and the delivery date is Aug. 14 to Aug. 24.  Now one month has past since I purchased the book, but I did not get the book yet!!  I really want to know what is going on with my book! 
 ...100% Guano.  To think a tree had to die for this crappola 
 March 14 FOLLOW UP REPORT: Pump found to stall and stop at 40 pounds pressure. Teresa K. Naeole of Q. Industries by phone said I could return pump and would be sent a more expensive tire pump in return. Returned pump was received at 159 Islington on February 16 at 12:55 pm. I have not received a new pump. I cannot get a response from telephone message requests at (303) 629 7700. Almost a month now. Yuk! Paul  I purchased the HV30 Portable Compressor because it promised rapid inflation of tires and blowup toys. The 140 pound pressure limit was certainly adequate. The price was right.  The Compressor comes with a hose that screws onto the compressor on one end and screws onto the tire valve stem on the other end. The compressor end thread was damaged. I had to use a pliers to tighten what should have been a hand tightened connection. Because the tire end screws on, air is lost as it is unscrewed after the tire is inflated. Most tire inflators come with a quick disconnect. Further, the compressor won't start against tire pressure if the connector hose is screwed on the tire valve. I had to start the compressor and then screw the hose onto the valve stem.  I haven't tried inflating a bike tire yet. I strongly suspect the air lost during unscrewing the connector hose will almost deflate the tire. This is just a great idea for inflating tires much faster than with pumps designed for much higher pressure limits but really poor engineering execution 
 It is very unusual for Brill to take a book out of publication.  However, they did with this title and the one other of Eisenman's that they printed prior to his monumental folly, "James the Brother of Jesus."  Bluntly put, this man is an embarassment to all scholarship because of his continued and persistent misreading of the historical evidence.  The work in question is completely covered in his later books.   You can find far less expensive examples of his scholarship on the used market.  Try one of those first.  If you like it, read a dozen other books by recognized authorities on the subject matter. Michael Baigent books do not count.  Eisenman is a great favorite of the Jesus denier crowd.  He is also a tenured hack in the University of California system.  He most recently surfaced in print opining that the naming of Judas Iscariot was one of the greatest slanders in history which has resulted in horrific repercussions down through the years.  This was carried in the ever scholarly Huffington Blog.  If you think I am tough on the man, do a Google search on his name, Robert H. Eisenman, and read Anthony Salardini's review of his book, "James the Just. 
 I liked a couple of tracks off ja fools first album, but only a little bit, i never felt him or rated him to be that good really. And when I heard this one my view of him could see what he is completely. This is pop, not rap and definately not hip hop. It's like he's trying to do RnB in a wannabe 2pac way. This is only for little girls and middle and upper class fa@@ots that don't know anything except for whats on radio or t.v and class it as 'rap' or 'hip hop'. This is an insult to both categories and to anyone who actually bought it. I'm lucky I didn't pay s#it for it and heard it from someone else who was trying to convince themselves that they liked it because of these marketing traps that fool blind people and my friend fell into too, thats why he didn't even listen to it for long either. I feel sorry for my friend, he could have bought something to smoke instead lol. Ja fool has beef with 50 cent too, another wack a$$ lame I don't care for at all. Its like they have all this planned to get them sales in the first place cos they know they ain't got skills. But theres always the people who fall for it, and if you feel me, you know who them people are without me mentioning. The truth is, rap has been sold out since 98/99, but hip hop is still there. And the people who like hip hop know that, while the others buy this s#it and pay weak fa@@ots. If you really like supporting clowns, go to the circus. This doesn't get any stars at all, just the anagram, 1 RATS(don't think it makes any sense lol, but sounds more appropriate). Get off the di@ks of these chumps and get into REAL music, theres REAL RnB, REAL Hip hop, REAL rap, REAL music outhere, you will never regret it after and listen to an album more than one month. Peace 
 Found this presentation very poor. After reading many of his books prior to seeing him deliver this speech, I was a greatly disappointed. It was a mumbled fumbled repetitive delivery with the most important facts obfusicated with a line like -I think you all know what im referring to here. I suggest read his books they are much better structured and more to the point. I give this dvd one star and repeat- read his books! dont be lazy and expect to get much out of this, I ask myself how can he be an MIT professor with such poor teaching skills, an off (ice) prof ? 
 even though this book can be read in only one sitting. The Gould vs Dawkins "war" is now Boring. See "The Triumph of Sociobiology" by Alcock, "The Tangled Wing" by Konner. The author has the temerity to attack Dawkins' attitude toward religion, then later to say that Mormonism "is founded on lies." This is not to say I disagree with this statement, only that it shows the contradictions you encounter in this book. Also, the author repeatedly disses Steven Pinker, such as for "being a linguist at MIT" who presumes to apply adaptationist explanations for "everything," and yet expects that we are to accept "a freelance journalist" (the author) as the expert witness to the so-called Darwin wars. Here's one of the author's snide comments which reveal what a know-nothing he is: "If the real purpose and justification of cultures is to spread the genes of their holders, it is hard to see how any sociobiologist could possibly resist conversion to Mormonism." The author would do well to review Cosmides & Tooby's idea that "we are not fitness maximizers, but adaptation executers," and Alcock's distinction between "proximate" and "ultimate" causes 
 This is an anti-intellectual book for reactionaries.  The idea with these people is that their political opinions are "facts" and since they are "facts" they cannot be challenged and must be accepted as history. The agenda behind this is usually to turn history into an intellectual prop for the government and right-wing ideas. The people involved currently want to rehabilitate ideas like the crusades, the idea of "civilizing primative people" through force and the essential unchanging goodness of America. But in the end its not about history so much as it is trying to create guidelines for how history should be presented and taught.  The book also wants to bring a sort of morality into history.  All conflicts are to have a good side and an evil side.  Taking an example from american history, Vietnam was a "good" war done for the "right" reasons.  The vietnamese who opposed America and anyone who opposed the war in the US is therefore by definition "evil".  There can, in this view, never be two sides to a conflict.  There are only good people who must be helped and evil people who oppose them who must be destroyed.  There is good and evil in history, but overplaying morality as the book proposes leads only to turning history into national propaganda.  Then the author goes into the virtues of "old fashioned" ideas.  In American history, the first old fasioned idea is the civilizing mission of America on the frontier.  The book wants to go back to the days were native americans are "savages" in the way of the march of progress and civilization.  Where colonialism exists to help the inferior peoples of the world reach a higher level of civilization.  And where every history sweeps inconvenant facts under the rug to promote the goodness and virtue of the country.  Its a history of propaganda and not much more.  The far left and the far right are each just as bad as the other.  Each wants to take history and use it as a weapon to re-educate the broader society.  The lesson should take away is that history as an academic discipline can't really work when the people in the field (right or left) use it as a political weapon.  The conflicts the author sees are not conflicts about "facts" or "history" but political conflicts where there is no easy answer.  History as an academic subject can only work when the facts presented are accepted by the overwhelming majority of those being taught the history 
 .....it's the good doctor.  Or should I say the draft-dodging flower picker who only became a "tough guy" when it was safe to do so 
 I didn't know there was a "Parental Advisory" on this cartridge until it arrived. Clearly not suitable for children. Also, I didn't know any of the songs on the cartridge. It would be helpful if there was a way to see the songs included before purchasing 
 I bought this book just for fun but to also maybe try out the techniques to increase our chances of having a girl. I got it the other week and was bored with it immediately. It got a little interesting when it talked about the philosophies of old on female and male reproduction but soon went on to be boring again. Also, it said that when you want to try for a girl you are to have sex everyday. However, when you are trying to conceive doctors recommend every other day because if you do it too often the male sperm count gets too low to be effective. It also stated that if you are on the pill and you discontinue it you should wait 6 months before you even begin to start trying to conceive. I am on the pill and my doctor said that once I discontinue it I should have at least one period on my own before we start trying to conceive. This book is a waste of a good book, money and your time 
 Trash sells and this is the definition of trash. Unfortunately many readers see this as history instead of fiction. Shaara who may have had a ghost writer obviously never visited a manuscipt library to do research. Readers should stick to reading the history of these events done by people who know how to research and how to write 
 My friend told me this book is incredible but I found it a little far fetched personally.  Why doesnt the guy just catch two fish which are each half as big and then he can be eating fish sticks for dinner instead of a big plate of nothing which is where he ends up (WARNING: spoiler alert) in the end of the book. It would be a lot easier and it makes exactly as good a story or even better because it is extra fish caracters.  Me I think writers should stick with writing about stuff that is on dry land given the track record so far.  TWO STARS for your book Ernest!  One star for each caracter you put in the story (even including fish)!  Youre rating is as good as Melvile got for his fish book so chin up 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 "Morvern Callar" was a film destined to cause some trouble, for a number of reasons. Of them:  #1- A movie adaptation that plays loose and fast and false with the book is often going to cause trouble.  #2- Whereas many high-minded films and their critics have decided subtlety is a wonderful thing, this movie has decided "If some subtlety is good, more subtlety must be doubly as good!"  #3- People who watch the movie are caught between their frustration with the film'd deliberate inaccessibility and their fear of appearing ignorant when rendering judgement. Thus, you have opinions that hang around on the poles of the extremes, with very little in the middle.  #4- This is not really a dog on the movie itself, but you do have to wonder about the kind of people who write reviews and get on message boards that sneer "If you don't like this movie, go watch The Fast and The Furious." As if anyone who does not like this movie is a wifebeater-wearing, greasy cinema Philistine.  #5- The idea that this movie is superior because it does not, quote "spoon-feed you" all the answers. I would venture that there is a difference between "spoon-feeding" answers and being purposefully evasive and disingenuous to the movie audience.  #6- Samantha Morton is in this movie. That's cause for a lot of trouble, for you see Samantha Morton is a talented actor (I just learned two months ago we're not supposed to use the word actress anymore) who has amassed a cadre of "devoted" (re: rabid) fans who believe that anything she touches turns to gold. Morton has definitively proved her acting chops in movies like "Jesus's Son," "Sweet And Lowdown," and "Code 46" but went really awry in the saccharine "In America" and the sputtering "Minority Report." Morton is a good actor, she's even a good actor for what she's given in this movie.   Unfortunately, that's not enough. This movie gives her too little, or perhaps too much, to work with. There is too much subtlety to this whole movie. Blank pages for the audience to ascribe what they think to them. You can either decide that look means she's torn up inside or not. You're given so little to work with, you can't say either way. Anyone who claims to have the definitive keys to this movie I would be suspicious of as a fraud out to elevate their standing.  This movie doesn't give you a key, or a lock, and nowadays that's supposed to be something to be proud of. It's not. You can make a movie in this fashion, but it needs... for lack of a better word, "meat" to it. People go and walk and do things and mess around and party but they don't truly seem to interact with each other or their environment. Emotions that I think were meant to seem complex and multidimensional seem to be totally ignored. A feeling of numbness and even inability for release would be nice, but the audience is not even given that. Halfway through the film we begin to suspect that we're being strung along, and the ending confirms that suspicion.  Stranger still, this movie gives off a very anachronistic feel to it, the film quality and setting looks like it was made in 1988 or some time.   In short, I don't care for this movie. Morton did a good job with what she had to work with, but in the end this film just did not do enough, confront enough, or accomplish enough. The way this movie has been structured, I believe the reviews on here tell more about the reviewer than the movie. This movie is blank pages. Stare at them, try and figure them out. Make of them what you wish. Just don't attempt to pass any of it off as gospel truth 
 George Barna is not fuzzy about what he defines and promotes in the book 'Revolution'. But, after reading it, the question still stands -- Is this a biblically sound direction that believers should embrace? Although the author promotes some essentials, it is still describing a redefined Christianity.   You don't find 'statistical examples' in the book about the many Christian believers who were asked to leave their Church if they didn't adhere to the seeker-sensitive programs and changes, or how many born-again committed Christians were ostracized for verbalizing biblical and theological concerns with the model of church they were emulating, due to the popularity of the purpose-driven books and church-growth programs. These changes that were coming into churches, have continued to mutate into what is being called the Emergent church movement. At the end of Barna's book, the author lists 'Recommended resources for Revolutionaries', and the list reveals -- Emergent Church leaders and Authors - McLaren & Sweet, and website favorable to the Emergent movement.   The purpose-driven movement and now the Emerging movement have brought BIG changes into the majority of America's Churches that not every Christian agrees with. Trying to discuss these concerns with a Pastor brought serious consequences that for some Christians marked them as 'Trouble-makers', and some were labeled as disrupting the unity of the body and were forced to leave. So to group all these Committed Christians into a 'Revolution' with the same motives isn't realistic or entirely factual. A Careful theological approach is needed in reading this book; it is too easy to get swept-up in the hype and emotional appeal of the message in the book, without carefully examining it to Scripture. stay alert.     
 What started as a wonderfully inventive work went downhill after about the halfway point. Too many plot points depended on one character overhearing something important. I finished the book a week ago and while I remember the characters and the situations, I can't recall what happened at the end. That says something 
 I found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend's house.  I asked my friend if she'd read it and she said, "Not yet, but it's a Patterson, so it must be good..."  Wrong-er words were never spoken.  This is the first Patterson novel I have read.  I am glad that I borrowed it from someone rather than bought it myself.  I suggest that if you insist on reading this, than you would be wise to do the same.  Let me just say that I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, but this is perhaps one of the most poorly written novels I have ever read.  I feel compelled to warn others so they can be spared the disappointment I experienced.  Maybe because it was "co-written" by this Gross person, but it just seems that this book was written too quickly, with the characters and the plot as a mere afterthought.    I kept reading, hoping that the story would get better, but it siimply did not.  When one of the characters was in mortal danger, I found myself thinking "who cares?"  This boring read has an utterly predicitable love-story woven throughout, and again, it seems pointless and cheesy.  One reviewer put it best by saying that this book is more like an outline of a story rather than a comprehensive novel.    The plot twists are predictable and uninteresting, and you sort of want to root for the bad guys because the main characters are soooo boring and flat.  The sentence structure is so elementary that I was surprised that this was written by an accomplished author and not a sixth grade English student.  I am by no means a "book snob" but I cannot believe that someone would review this book with a 4 or 5 star rating.  It is just beyond me.  If you are looking at the writing alone, it is terrible, not to mention the unbelievable events that take place.  Main character Boxer is always in the right place at the right time and everything comes together so neatly that you just cannot believe any of the events could possibly take place.  I know that a lot of die-hard Patterson fans will probably give me bad ratings just because I didn't like this book, but I am trying to be as honest as possible.    Maybe some of his earlier works are better?  Well, I guess they couldn't be a whole lot worse in any case 
 This book is a random jamble of oddly-assembled cliches without direction or application. The writing style is comprised mainly of four to five word sentences, run together with little regard to flow or building a point.  References are often cited with no explanation, and often as many as six references are made to other chapters within a single paragraph.  The most useful advice in this book is "read articles or books about..." the topic at hand.  At least the author admitted in this instance that he has no idea what he's talking about and had the decency to refer the reader elesewhere for advice.    It's no surprise that no real publisher picked up this horrible book. It's easy to see this isn't as much a book as it is a collection of old-school powerpoint slides smashed together into a "book" 
 This cd by A Perfect Circle, is indeed unappetizing, and well, an incredibly sad attempt for a successful album. About two of the songs on this album are original, all others are butchered covers or sad attempts to bring in, remix or add together songs from Thirteenth Step.  1.Annihilation- Actually a very interesting opener for this album, there is no singing, but whispering. Instrumentation is interesting as well. It's not bad.  2.Imagine- Dreadful. This song might, MIGHT be liked by people who have never heard John Lennon's original, beautiful song. A Perfect Circle took a happily melodic, wonderfully worded song and turned it into a depressing and drab song with a much unneeded metronome of the same chords of the piano playing constantly.   3.Passive- A good display of what A Perfect Circle is all about. It's a good song.  4.Peace, Love, and Understanding- Wow. As if A Perfect Circle couldn't have gotten worse with the cover songs. This cover-if you can call it that-was derived from the Elvis Costello song, "What's So Funny 'Bout Peace, Love, and Understanding". Elvis Costello states that everything is about peace, love, and simply understanding eachother in a fun, upbeat song that gets people thinking that there's really nothing funny about peace, love, and understanding. A Perfect Circle might be saying the same thing, but in the most boring, and awful song I have heard. Even if you aren't a fan of Elvis Costello, it's hard to enjoy this song. The same five or six notes are played on the acoustic guitar throughout. It's boring, unimaginative, and very unrepresenting of the magic an artist like Elvis Costello can make.  5. Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums- This song, goes on forever. "Counting Bodies..." is a six minute long song, which is made up of the lyrics from "Pet" and "Lullaby" from Thirteenth Step, and really repetative drum beats that seem to go on for an eternity. The words and singing are good but I suggest listening to "Pet" or "Lullaby" to hear them. Not "Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums".  6. What's Going On- Another awful cover song. When does the song get started? The melodic chords of voices throughout this song lack emotion and enthusiasm in a less than exciting, long drawn out song with the same lyrics over and over, "what's going on", well, what's going on with this song? It needs more, alot more. It's degrading to the original artist.  7. Gimme Gimme Gimme- Actually an almost enjoyable song, if you dont listen to the chorus. The stanzas are good, lyrics and a voice that scream desperation, its moving and makes you think. The chorous however doesn't represent the stanzas in the least. "Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, I need more, I need more, don't ask what for, don't ask what for" is the entire chorous, more growled than sung. In the least, it doesn't sound like APC.  8. Freedom of Choice- The opposite of "Gimme Gimme Gimme". The chorous is the good part and the stanzas are flat out boring, with awful instrumental melodies. Repetative lyrics also lurk all throughout this song. It's not creative. All you have to do is read the song title to learn the lyrics to this song.  9. Let's Have A War- A sarcastic anti-war song. Myself being anti-war, I don't get the message here. Although the chorous and the beginning of the song are sarcastic with "Let's have a war, so you can go and die", it doesn't stay this way. With lyrics like "give guns to the queers" the message of no war is replaced with degrading lyrics to many such as these. If APC were as anti war as they lead on, lyrics like these wouldn't be used regardless of sarcasm. All audiences may not approve.  10. When The Levee Breaks- What is this?! If you've never known that Led Zeppelin did a song called "When the Levee Breaks" then looked at the song lyrics and compared them both, you never would have known they were the same song. This song can barely even be compared to "When the Levee Breaks" because its so rediculous. It's barely a cover song. The lyrics to a classic song and its title were taken and sloppily put together in a depressing song. This song in general is also very boring, depressing, and bad. I don't recommend it to sell you on APC.  11. Fiddle and the Drum- This song sounds like a Christmas Carol. There are no instruments, and although the voices put together are melodic and pretty it's incredibly boring. It's hard to get through. You keep waiting and waiting for it to get started then it just...doesn't. It's not something A Perfect Circle has commonly done...or should do for that matter.   In short. This album is compiled of bad cover songs, boring drab songs, and maybe one or two listenable or good songs. I completely don't recommend this album to anyone wishing to get started on listening to APC. Grab Thirteenth Step or Mer de Noms, something with some taste 
 I bought and examined this book thoroughly. There are so many old concepts I wonder whether the author has ever re-read its current second edition. It is supposed to have been written for C++ programmers but of what generation? I understand that the current 2nd edition was written after the release of MS Visual C++ 4. So, the source code still assumes that C++ doesn't have the true and false Boolean constants since the author #defines them, which causes an error in both Visual C++ 6 and later. In fact, the use of #include <iostream.h> and void main()indicate that the book is not ANSI compliant. The web site that supports the book provides source code, for MSVC 4 (only after I bought the book, which is extremely expensive, did I find out on the 4th page that it was released in 1996; but the current C++ Standard is from 1998). I tried compiling them in MSVC6 and MSVC.NET. None of the programs compiled (none at all). Even after re-creating the programs by adding files manually, I received many many errors. I tried to fix them and also tried compiling from the Command Prompt, to no avail. It is true that we don't have that many books on compiler development but just as these books are rare, this particular one will be to no help. It is (very) old and its programs don't work. The only things you might get are the authors comments that may help you with some suggestions or guidance, which will be little 
 I read this book because it was supposed to be one of Heinlein's classics.  I liked several of Heinlein's early works and thought I'd try this one, although I heard it was controversial.  After reading it, I can see why.  I cannot recommend this book.  It is not a classic, and if it wasn't written by Heinlein it probably wouldn't have been published, and if it was published, would have been forgotten long ago.  Other reviewers state that this is a book that questions social customs.  I'm sorry, but stories about time travel in which the protagonist meets and beds his mother as a young woman are not questioning social norms, they are the rantings of a dirty old man.  `To Kill a Mockingbird' this is not.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long are entertaining, but they don't make up for the poor quality of the rest of the text.  I regret spending money on this book, and I really regret losing the time I wasted reading it.  7MAY06 - I've added to this review after receiving a few not helpful votes, because, in part, I was concerned that my original review was too terse.  My opinion about this novel has not changed.  This is a series of stories about the life and adventures of Lazarus Long, a man who has lived thousands of years and experienced, effectively, multiple lives.  That is, he has loved, married, and 'built a life' several times.  He has now grown weary of the tedium of life and is contemplating suicide.  The novel consists of dialogue with some of his living decendants as he tells the story of his life.  Stories, really.  Each major section in the book is a vignette in LLs life.  In theory, this was a very good idea for a sci-fi novel, but in practice, this novel is simply tripe.  There are several things that I really dislike about this novel and would not recommend it to anyone.  Like much of Heinlein's later writings, this novel explores alternate family relationship (i.e. a code for incest).  As I mentioned above, one of the vignettes involves LL travelling back in time to bed his mother.  Another relates a `complex' (i.e. sexual) relationship between brother and sister.  Additionally, most of the novel is dialogue between the characters, there isn't much action.  I generally view this as a strength, not a weakness, but in this case the dialogue can be classified only as mindless banter loaded with sexual inuendo and overtone.  The characters on Beverly Hills 90210 had better lines.  If you are looking for a good science fiction novel, this is NOT IT.  This is really a novel about alternate family relationships with some sci-fi elements (e.g. longevity and time travel) in the plot.  There are some who may find this type of novel compelling, but from my perspective, the author of `Starship Troopers' and `The Puppet Masters' fell a long way when he published this novel.  The Notebooks of Lazarus Long, a collection of witty saying interspersed throughout the book are great.  Judging from the other reviews, there are many who find this novel appealling.  Just be warned that this novel is very different than Heinlein's earlier classics.  There may be Time Enough for Love, but most people don't have enough time in their life to waste on this silliness 
 I had looked so forward to Mott-Davidson's latest book. It just wasn't as good as the others. I see that there are many other reviews that agree with me. What in the world happened? Has she perhaps, 'passed the torch'? It just doesn't seem like her usual style. It was disjointed, there were a couple of really huge mistakes. She introduced two new characters, insinuating, they had always been there. It was a mess. I can only hope that the next one, if there is a next one, is better. C'mon Diane, don't let us down! 
 I didn't know this sort of 18th and 19th century Travel Literature was still being written today. Tom Miller travels awful far to come home with his suitcase full of frat-boy stereotypes and over determined metaphors. Cubans here are sexy, mango eating, Chevy driving caricatures. Having  traveled there frequently over the last ten years, I can tell you the only  subject illuminated by this book is the inability of Miller's mind to look  past his own North American biases. There are excellent books about Cuba  written by strangers to that country, see Cardenal's for example. There are  also excellent books about Cuba written by Cubans, see for example Franqui.  This book however is not worthy of the trees that died for it 
 IRS Form 1023 is one of the most important pieces of starting a nonprofit organization. Yet this book, which is stamped with a 2005 copyright, contains information for the outdated, pre-2004 version of the 1023.  For example, the advice is given that one can attach a form SS-4 (request for EIN) with the form 1023, and in the form 1023 state "SS-4 attached" when it asks for an SS-4. Wrong. The IRS now requires an EIN be registered prior to submitting a 1023.  Likewise, the hints about "Part this" and "Question that" are completely out of sync with the actual application.  Grudgingly, I give the author credit for the other parts of the book. But 1023 is so important, that it would be terrible to let anyone rely on the information in this book.  A good source of detailed, up-to-date information on the 1023 is "IRS Form 1023 Tax Preparation Guide" by Jody Blazek. And I also recommend the companion book by the same author, "IRS Form 990 Tax Preparation Guide for Nonprofits".  Get those books. Do not get this book 
 The prof at my college chose this book as a textbook for a OS course. That is a mistake. This book is too dry. The content is dated. It is simply NOT readable. I don't know why so many people give it good rating. Go figure..... 
 There is an odd conceit found in many otherwise intelligent people to the effect that as they're brilliant on one field, they must be brilliant in EVERY field, especially as other fields must be trivially simple in copmparison with the one they're in. Hence we see doctors losing fortunes in the stock market, scientists losing money in business ventures, a generally smart people making asses of themselves in every way possible.  Penrose' argument can be boiled down into a very few simple assertions:  1. Mathematicians appear to derive proofs in a way that is not describable in the algorithmic language of computation.   2. The only processes we know that are not so describable are quantum processes.  3. Ergo the way mathematicians derive proofs, and by extension cognitive processes in general, must involve quantum processes, which for some reason he locates in the microtubles of neurons.   Now I don't know much about quantum mechanics, but I do know a fair bit about cognition and neurophysiology, and I can safely say that Penrose is talking hooey from his first assertion on. He's made a very clumsy error in looking at mental processes that occur a level not open to concious introspection, and then assuming that because individuals cannot describe these processes, they are not describable using the language of ordinary logic.  Everything else in the book derives from that simple error- an error I'd hope a second year Psych student wouldn't make. If he'd shared his manuscript with at least one psychologist, maybe this would have been pointed out to him, but again, perhaps that's just that conceit rearing its head again; how could a mere psychologist hope to understand the work of a briliant mathematician? ;-)  If you're looking for a good book that will explain cognition once and for all, I don't think it's been written yet. Certainly not by Penrose 
 I am a HUGE fan of Baby Einstein.  My son loves them all.  He is 2 and a half, and still watches them.  I love them also, because they are so nice on the ears.  I can't STAND the background noise of most kids shows.  Especially over and over and over!!  But Baby Einstein is pleasant and nice to watch.  BUT Baby Wordsworth is stupid and not worth 1.00 at a garage sale.  We have not even made it through the whole thing one single time.  My son won't sit still for even 5 minutes of it.  Save your money.  If you want something to help you with vocabulary, we LOVE Baby Babble.  It's a must!  My son learned several words from it 
 THE TOMMYKNOCKERS is one of the more unsuccessful of Stephen King adaptations to hit the screen.  Originally a 1993 tv miniseries, the movie suffers from lackluster direction, mediocre performances and no sense of true suspense or horror.  Typically set in a homey little New England town, the plot centers on the discovery of a mysterious object in the woods by a local writer (Marg Helgenberger) who along with her alcoholic poet boyfriend(a poorly cast Jimmy Smits) decides to keep it a secret until the whole thing is unearthed.  Meanwhile, a ghostly green light emits from the object, causing the townspeople to go bonkers in one form or another, whether it be by inventing stupid gadgets or wandering around with glowing green eyes.  At three hours, THE TOMMYKNOCKERS definitely overstays its welcome and that is one problem in watching a miniseries in one take; it can become redundant.  Tighter direction and a more focused cast could have helped but aside from John Ashton, EG Marshall and Joanna Cassidy in supporting roles, most of the performances seem phone in, and Traci Lords is ridiculously hilarious as the postal slut.  A real misfire 
 The subject of this book is relative of the author who back in the 1840s, converted to the faith of LDS and moved to "Zion" (Utah) where she met with hardship and situations that did not meet her expectations. The book proves to be well written but poorly researched. It doesn't help that the author's objectivity was compromise because she was the author's grandmother, several times removed.  In this book, it seem like Sally Denton is going out of her way to slam dunked the Mormons. Obviously, Jean Rio was misguided or misled about what the LDS was all about. Her ignorance seem to be classical that its based on blind faith and once she awaken to it, she discovered much to her dismay that her new church may not be all that she thought to be. The author stated that the Mountain Meadow Massacre was the cause of her defection but it seem all to pat to this reader. There seem to be a lot of mountains made from this molehill.  I don't think her researched is all that well done. The author depends too much on diary left behind and make several conjectures which are not fact based. The book feel more like a personal biography of author's grandmother (several times removed), its short, readable but ultimately unimportant due to lack of depth to the research. While the subject person was important to the author, its seem like a story of dissatisfied customer. 
 Well I hate to say It but I'm not a big fan of this release at all really. I mean there are a few really good tracks but the rest seems to be half hearted and just not that good. "Thirteenth Step" and "Mer De Noms" were both amazing but this just is so far from that. It almost seems as if the record company needed the band to put out something as quickly as possible before Maynard went back too Tool. If I had to pick the best tracks on this album they would have to be "Imagine", "Passive", "Peace Love And Understanding", and "Let's Have A War" by far. Everything else is boring and not very good in my opinion. Here's my track ratings...  1. Annihilation - 2/10 2. Imagine - 9/10  3. (What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace Love And Understanding - 9.5/10   4. What's Going On - 3/10  5. Passive - 10/10  6. Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie - 1/10      7. People are People - 2/10 8. Freedom of Choice - 4/10 9. Let's Have A War - 10/10 10. Counting Bodies Like Sheep... - 4/10    11. When the Levee Breaks - 7/10 12. Fiddle and the Drum - 1.5/10  Overall: 52% F  Yea it did get an F grade percentage wise but there are some really good tracks so I feel it does deserve a 2 star rating. I just really hated this album and don't feel it even comes within reach of the last two. It seems rushed and boring. Sorry, I guess I just didn't like it very much. 
 I love reading Peggy Noonan's WSJ column; so let's get that out of the way right now. Peggy generally writes in a stream-of-consciousness form that I like. It captures my attention from the first sentence and holds me to the end. But not this book. After a page or two I noticed I was skipping ahead, looking for the bait and the hook. It's not there. That's Writing 101. She knows that! What I suspect is this: Her publisher contracted with her for a give-back linked to something else, and she wasnt interested in the project. It shows 
 Stories are well crafted, but the subject matter didn't interest me. Not bad, but I wouldn't buy it again 
 Perhaps this book was good 10 years ago but not in 2005. I read the first few chapters and after several hours of going through the so-called "myths" I just had enough... Most points they call "myths" are common knowledge to anyone in business or marketing fields (At least NOW). Again, I am not sure how the situation was 10 years ago but now it is not worth the paper it is printed on. Many better books are out there so don't waste your time 
 The book was beautiful. I enjoyed it. My kids didn't though. 
 I cant imagine any one accepting this unbelievable story line. It's garbage, probably one of if not the worst I've ever read. I made it through 30-40 pages before it ended up in the trash.  So much for this author, he may have had a winner or two but from this point on he's on my "do not buy list"  I gave it a one star because there was nothing lower 
 Eileen Chandler is getting married and Elizabeth MacPherson is the family representative at the occasion.  A recent college graduate, Elizabeth has agreed to be a bridesmaid for her cousin even though they haven't seen each other in years.  When Elizabeth arrives early, she finds the family propensity for eccentricity hasn't slowed down a bit.  But reconnecting with family takes a dangerous turn when a body is discovered.  When the death is ruled murder, no one in the house is above suspicion.  I'd heard good things about Sharyn's books, so picked this up with much anticipation.  I was very disappointed in it, however.  This is really more a cultural farce then a mystery, but not being from the South, I didn't get it.  The mystery proceeds through fits and starts, with very little several pieces being left dangling at the end.  And the characters were too over the top to be believable.  I've heard that this author's books improve as she progresses, so I might give her another try in the future.  But, based on this book, I'm not going to rush out to do so 
 unfortunately, just like their other 2 books, trinny and susannah fail to grasp the concept that there is no possible way that they both have every single figure flaw as all women. some of their advice is useful but overall this book was nothing specia 
 I thought maybe it was just old age creeping up on me. The Jimi Hendrix that I remember from my youth sounded a whole lot better than what I saw on this DVD. I thought I had just changed my tastes and wasn't into his songs anymore. Then I read some reviews here....and I feel better. It wasn't me: it was this concert - it sucked!  I just wanted to have something on film of one of the most famous guitar players of all time, so I thought this long concert would do it.  All it turned out to be was noise, which was really disappointing considering the songs I liked best from him were all included in this concert.  Unfortunately, they were hardly recognizable.  Save your money on this one 
 I guess if you wanted diagram jokes like an english teacher this is a good book to learn from but, don't expect to get any laughs. This book is a difficult read and I flipped through half the book just to get to something I could enjoy reading. Maybe all those five star ratings are his family members and friends. Comedy is about being fun, having fun and the ability to make people laugh. This book was about none of these. $18.95 up in smoke. I normally would not even take the time to write a review but, maybe it will save somebody else some money. I read "Stand Up Comedy Virgins" by Paul Stoecklin and it was a fun read to learn from. Try (...) for what I consider to be the best Standup education 
 For example, William Sidis is described as 'burned out', or unbalanced. At the time of his death - his friends did not think that he was either. He wasn't. He rejected capitalism, for that he is remembered, even in new books - as unbalanced. This author did not do research 
 I picked this book out of desperation for something to entertain me while on vacation.  The book did not grab my attention at first, but at least the premise sounded plausible.  However, as the plot unfolded, it grew more outlandish by the page.  Mr. Rollins clearly does not have a good grasp of technology and science and therefore should refrain from writing about those topics. He is no Michael Crichton.  He falls back on the lazy plot device of a supercomputer with artificial intelligence to fill gaps in his story.  It is so convenient to ask the computer to do any task or find any information much like snapping your fingers or rubbing Aladdin's lamp.  The climax was just plain dumb and made me angry.  Skip this stinker 
 Don't buy this case before reading this message. This is a terrible waterproof case. I used it once and for 5 minutes only!!!! I took it for my swimming lesson and in less than 5 minutes it drowned my ipod nano!!! I complained at the otterbox web site, but they didn't bother to answer me. DON'T buy this item. You will be waisting your money 
 The entire book is very short and can easily be read by anyone in just a couple of days. By the end I was thinking to myself "that's it?". In all those pages, this is all they can come up with, after all the years of experience? The book could have been a little more deep and went a little further. To be really honest, I could pretty much describe to you what the entire book tells us in just a few sentences. I guess I don't know what I was expecting. All of this to me is common sense information most everyone already knows. Like, if you want to swim, you've got to just jump in the water.  I wouldn't expect anyone to agree with me, but this is just one person's opinion. I'm sure it might be very useful for some people 
 It is unfortunate that such pseudo-philosophical and pseudo-intellectual drivel gets passed off as either Christian or thinking. Greer's book is riddled with drastic oversimplification of complex philosophical and historical questions, with blatant misrepresentations, and self-defeating denials of the possibility of absolute truth and a-cultural or a-historical observation. Don't people like Greer ever stop to consider that their conclusions apply to their own claims? If it is "impossible to divest oneself of one's culture and historical moment," as Greer asserts (p. 37), then this impossibility extends to Greer himself. Consequently, his claim is merely an expression of his culture and historical moment. Therefore, his claim is not absolutely true. And, if this claim is not absolutely true, then it is not absolutely true that it is impossible to divest oneself of one's culture and historical moment. Don't people like Greer ever stop to think that they are doing the very thing they claim can't be done? Doesn't Greer realize that he is purporting to make a trans-cultural, a-historical claim about all claims? If Greer's book is a mapping of postmodernism, he seems to have followed the map to the point of imbibing postmodern relativism. If anyone is interested in mapping postmodernism, my recommendation is that you should locate a different map 
 Don't expect to combine recipe ingredients in the slow cooker and walk away.  More "pre-cooking" is involved, most often browning beef, but in some cases dirtying numerous other pots as well.  For the most part, the end results are pleasant, but often not worth the extra effort (and, in some cases, it seems as though utilizing non-slow-cooking methods would work just as well, if not better. 
 When I got this book I was expecting some good advice. But what I found was a bunch of ridiculous crap. She suggests that all meat eaters are "blocked vegetarians" ... they really want to be vegetarians but they have fears. Give me a break, she couldn't be more wrong. The book does not offer practical advice and just adds to the idea that vegetarians are weird people. Trying telling a meat eater you think they are a blocked vegetarian and see the roars that will get you. This author offers a fantasy world, it's not based on reality. Plus she starts the book out with bumper stickers and saying about vegetarians... like vegetarians don't also have bumper stickers and saying about meat eating? Please! She portrays us as victims of meat eaters, and misses the idea that groups like PETA are out there making vegetarians look like complete idiots. If you want to read this book I would suggest you get it used or at the library, it's not worth buying. It's good for a laugh only. "Blocked vegetarians"... LOL! Give me a break 
 It's always discouraging when self-professed Christians lie, and Dembski purposefully perpetuates a lie in order to further his ID claims.  The lie is that evolution by natural selection is "random."  Most famous is the analogy of a hurricane sweeping through a junkyard and creating a jumbo jet.  That's so ridiculously impossible that evolution must be impossible, too.  Right?  But only the genetic mutations underlying evolution are random.  And being random, most of them are in fact terrible failures, frequently causing the fetus carrying them to spontaneously abort.    Only those mutations that do not harm the carrier can be passed on to future generations.  That is a non-random selection process.  In general, only those mutations that actively benefit the carrier are likely to spread throughout the population.  That is a non-random selection process, too. (That's a bit simplified, but the general point holds--even harmful mutations that spread do so non-randomly.)  Dembski's claim that all non-randomness is evidence of design fails the simplest test of logic.  So his goal of mathematically proving design by finding complexity is a red herring.  His implicit claim that evolution by natural selection is randomness in action is a flat-out lie.    Don't be fooled by the ID claims of scientific oppression.  Dembski's work is unscientific not because he believes in God (many scientists believe in God and get published), but because it tries to prove the unprovable.  Karl Popper pointed out decades ago that you can't prove a negative.  Evolutionary biologists don't claim they have proven the non-existence of God because they understand Popper's principle.  But Dembski believes he can prove that evolution didn't cause something--he never actually tries to prove God, he only tries to prove something else didn't happen, then sticks God in place as the only explanation.  That is bad logic, bad science, and even bad theology 
 This book is very well laid out, and points out both sides of the arguments. Very good for seeing what one side says to one issue, and what the other side says to the same. However, some issues are touchy, inerrancy being one.  Page 146 "the Bible is a  trustworthy communication by Spirit-guided interpreters and is true in all it intends to teach." The Bible was not given to men to teach them science, but the God of Science is the God of the Bible - If the Holy Spirit is the author of the text and He errs in some matter (in this case of science) then God is not God.  B.B. Warfield, whom they quote for the "conservative" position, is right. Go get a copy of Revelation and Inspiration, Oxford Press, 1927. Still the best. I am very concerned with how they also handle the Holy Spirit. While they acknowledge His place in the writing of the Bible, all I seem to read about is what did the author on earth mean? I see precious little to help one understand the place of the Holy Spirit upon the authors, except for a bit here and a dash there. How about what does the Bible say? Could we please get to that? I really do wish more biblical texts were quoted.  I am WELL aware many interpretations exist, but this does not negate the fact that we cannot deny the singular purpose of The Scriptures as the revelation of Jesus Christ. Yet, the reader feels lost on this point, and that could also be due to the fact that this book clearly needs an editor. As a humanities major, I went through line by line, and condensed almost 70-80% of the sentences. No appendx for terms, and a cursory index of subjects - I am disappointed that Nelson would let something like that slide especially when this book is used in higher education. It is a good book. Well researched. Covers both sides of an issue. Points the reader in the right direction. Helpful for the foundations of hermeneutics. Footnotes as far as the eye can see. But better exist. Can be improved - all hope is not lost -but a drawing board will be needed. 
 I have no idea what these other reviewers saw but it wasn't the same movie I have. This movie in no way represents the life of La Cosa Nostra. There are so many scenes in the movie that are totally unrealistic. It's present day and the guys are "running numbers". Hello, ever hear of the Lottery. They start up a "bookie buisness". Besides calling it a bookie buisness, which is just plain retarded, how are 4 nobodies going to start bookmaking and become so sucessful that they are taking the action away from a mobster. Then when they catch the attention of that mobster he thinks they have balls instead and takes them in to work for him. I guess if they made it true to life those guys would be in a pit in the middle of the woods chopped up in pieces and the movie would have been over. Then again that might have been a good thing. The acting was terrible except for the late Ray Serra and Joe D'Onofrio. Even Joe Viterelli who is a fine actor came up short given his terrible lines from a script that seemed like a first draft that needed Tons of work. Rent the HBO film Gotti if you want to see what it's really like. Just to include Wannabees and William DeMao in the same breath as Goodfellas and the great living legend Robert DeNiro is an insult. Now DeMao is making "Searching for Bobby DeNiro", he could only wish. The only reason I gave it a star is because I had to, they dont let you give it none 
 The music in this CD is beautiful, the lyrics are lovely as well. The fact that I don't like Michael Crawfords' voice might have something to do with this...Gerard Butler was the first Phantom I heard.... so I hold my standards to him. Michael Crawfords' voice is nice, I'll admit, but give me Gerry any day. Perhaps Michael DID have a voice suited for the role, and perhaps Gerard Butler didn't, but I'm partial to emotional songs to wooden-flat ones, and baritone voices to tenor voices. Sarah has a lovely voice, but in my opinion, it is a bit too mature for the part of a 16 year old girl.  But don't let this stop you-buy this CD...you may love it, you may hate it. Just compare Michael's voice to Gerard's voice...the difference is rather laughable 
 Changing Minds is very disappointing - average to very poor writing, poor development of ideas, ideas that have been shown to be weak or invalid constructs, and very little substance.  You will learn very little about how to change anyone's mind or your own.  Reading this book and finishing it is a grind 
 ...and was left putting the book down every two seconds because I was annoyed by it. It is not marvelously written; in fact, I found myself correcting his sentence structure and grammar in at least every other paragraph, if not more (editor, please?). It's an interesting enough plot, but the way it's put forth is mindnumbing. The non-fiction information he put in there could have been ten times more interesting in two ways. First, if the information had been summarized in about two pages. And second, if he hadn't pretended like everyone reading this book was in the second grade and had minimal comprehension abilities.   I'm usually a fast reader, but this book (a quick 415-page paperback read) took me more than a month, just because I had to keep putting it down. If you simply want something to "frighten" you, or are unusually interested with autopsies (there are about five million in the book), and don't care about poor writing, pick this book up 
 This collection of essays and excerpts from other works purports to present issues of congregational conflict in a systematic manner.  And while I found a great deal of pertinent information and suggestions regarding the handling of congregational conflict I struggled with a lack of coherence in this compilation.  That is, the essays and excerpts did not flow as a meaningfully presented linear argument.  Rather, the work read like an often disparate collections of fragmentary arguments.  In fact, this lack of whole, this lack of cohesion, was so distracting that I wondered if this compilation was little more than a marketing ploy to offer another work that would provide income for the publisher.  I am hopeful that this is not the case.  Rather, I trust that this compilation is nothing less than an attempt to provide a variety of perspectives on dealing with congregational conflict that would prompt the reader to further seek information from those authors with whom the reader resonated.  I do not recommend this work as a good resource for dealing with congregational conflict.  Instead, I do recommend it as a sort of "card catalog" that one might browse through so as to discover other works and resources that would be beneficial for dealing with congregational conflict. 
 If you're a beginner trying to learn Latin on your own, the Complete Idiot's Guide is not the best way to do it.  It reminds me of a bad high school language class where you have to memorize lists of words, but never learn to put together an actual sentence.  This book attempts to make Latin easy on you by presenting only the bare minimum of grammar, but as another reviewer pointed out, grammar is all-important in Latin for figuring out who does what to who in a sentence.  This book earns the second star only because it's clearly written, funny, and includes interesting tidbits such as the differences between medieval and classical Latin.  While it is (barely) possible to learn Latin from this book, there are much better textbooks out there.  Lots of people here have recommended Wheelock.  With all due respect to them, I practically fell asleep reading it in the bookstore.  It is obviously rigorous, but it's also dry as dust.  I recommend instead "Latin via Ovid," which I bought after much research.  Not only am I actually successfully teaching myself Latin, I get to read great mythology stories!  Slightly easier are the books aimed at the high school level such as the Oxford and Cambridge textbooks and Ecce Romani.  Try one of these books instead of the Complete Idiot's Guide 
 I ordered the Journal about a year ago and received 2 issues, and  never received another issue.  I contacted customer service about the problem, used the problem  report forms(or whatever it's called) and NEVER heard from them again.  I get this email today telling me to renew my subscription...  (after I had almost forgotten about the whole incident)    What nerve!!! I remember when I bought this a year ago, another person had written a review warning people that she had not received her subscription.  Back then I just thought this would never happen to me..  (the same thing happened with Vogue magazine)  Boy was I wrong.  The 2 issues that I did receive were pretty good though.  I buy tons of stuff from Amazon but I would highly recommend getting  this from another vendor or ebay(they're usally cheaper too)  
 This collection of CVR transcripts from air crashes and near misses is a huge waste of money.  MacPherson just reproduces excerpts from the transcripts that can be found on the internet at the NTSB website and many other sites. In their complete form and for free.  His short paragraphs of explanations of the incidents involved add nothing to the book because it is obvious that the author knows nothing of aviation.  If you are a true student of air crashes, look up the complete accident reports on the NTSB website or avsaf.org or a number of other sites.  These are free and much more informative.  Black Box is a cheap excuse for jounalism.  I'd actually give it less than 1 star if I could.[... 
 Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Not recommended.  In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer, Karl Shapiro said, "I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is," ". . . as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age," and ". . . he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must." Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either.  Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller's experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Miller's stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. Miller writes, "A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am"--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.  When they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as "woman" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the "living," no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.  Miller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as ". . . a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot," he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine.  Miller's logic about the working world is facile; he writes, "If you want bread, you've got to get in harness, get in lockstep." On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. In other words, if most people weren't in "lock step," Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including "the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers"), a reliance which he resents. He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives.  Seemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing. When a friend says, "A boy can break your heart . . . He's so damned beautiful! And so cruel!" Miller writes, "We had to laugh at this. It sounded preposterous. But Collins was in earnest." When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies, he writes, "At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good."  Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet, but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense. Speaking of buildings and statues, Miller says, " . . . they must be saturated with my anguish," the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges. He describes artists such as himself as the "inhuman ones." "I am inhuman! I say it with a mad, hallucinated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles. Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinning a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw, some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on." Whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared, rambling on for pages, I found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes, disease, friends, and hunger.  Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the worst book I have ever read (and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn). Shapiro says, "There are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [emancipated from what? --DLS], these clowns and clairvoyants, celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of America." If Miller, with his whining, his criticism, his holier-than-everyone attitude, his "art," his two-dimensional view of people, and his obsession with excrement, is the "greatest" of these souls, may I never meet the least.  Note: If there were a 0 stars option, Tropic of Cancer would have earned it 
 I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time.  It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning.  The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my ratin 
 If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way 
 As others have noted, this product prevents AOL from loading on my machine - it just stalls (AOL is using a connection via Cable). It also "automatically" registers itself with Symantec and starts the counting of the 1 year subscription unless you cut of internet access. I removed it from that machine (a Toshiba Laptop) and installed it on my backup Dell (an older Pentium 3 866mhz). Both were running XP with the latest updates.  It slowed Internet Explorer to a crawl and locked it up when I attempted to first write this review.  It also slowed overall performance, when not in the browser, though this seems illogical.  I uninstalled it (it was the only Norton product on the machine) and it left Live Update installed until I manually started the removal of it. Fortunately everything is back to normal after removing all.  This is truly dangerous software for those with at least my type of equipment:  Stay away unless you have very poor browsing security and a machine that does not choke on it 
 I did not get my order. you were suppoused to send my money back. i am waiting. thank 
 Purchased this as a gift for my grandchildren....This is Boring and absolutely NO FUN no matter what your age.  I guess for almost $40 you shouldn't expect flashing lights or something a little more exciting. Doesn't even deserve the one star I gave it.  
 I've had several of these; the spout in time will leak.  If you don't mind a leaky spout this is a great product 
 Dean makes very specific accusations in the very subtitle of this book, yet he provides no documentation to back his assertions. I expect more from a scholar 
 What this is is a cheap skateboard, with a cheap metal bar stuck through it, with some Dora stuff pasted on last minute.  Within the first day of using this, the Dora sticky-paper they put on the bottom of the skateboard (where your child puts their feet) was torn.  Within two days, it was nearly completely destroyed.   I tried to fix this with elmer's glue, but to no avail.  Now I have a 'plain' scooter...  I've seen this thing on sale for less than a ten-spot, it MIGHT be worth that price, but not any more.. 
 I loved the idea of the Clapper. I live alone so the clapping sound wouldn't bother me and I looked forward to the convenience factor. My first Clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working, but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short. Did I learn my lesson? Oh, no! I went ahead and purchased another Clapper some months later. The night before last, the lamp I connected this one to started blinking. I checked the lightbulb and it was OK. It was only went I got down close to the Clapper plugged into the outlet that I heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity. Once again the Clapper crapped out, this time in a different lamp, different outlet. Will I never learn? Thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device. Can you say "housefire"? Again, how dumb am I? Is the unit UL-approved and, if so, have any other complaints been lodged about it? How does one find this out? I like my gadgets, but "buyer beware" on this one 
 I was disappointed with this book. He has his picture on every other page, literally. The numbering of chapters is confusing. I truely have gotten much more out of "Strong Women Stay Slim" by Miriam Nelson, which I got from the library, and now have purchased. I would suggest taking a look at Jorge's somewhere before making your purchase~ (do as I say, not as I do LOL) "Strong Women" just seemed so much simpler, and the drawings of the exercises are pleasant and clear. Often times I don't want to do the exercises, then I think "well, I'll just do the first one" and before I know it I've done them all and am feeling better. In fact, I have now ordered Nelson's book on arthritis. Note: There are only 6 basic exercises plus stretching in Nelson's work, so it certainly doesn't take much longer than Jorge's "8 Minutes. 
 I went to visit 6 Flags Marine World in Vallejo, CA. When I arrived there I found to my surprise that it was closed for no special reason. The opening times in the book are wrong! Then I decided to visit Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. I was late for the last boat at 2:15 PM. In the book says the last one is at 2:45 PM... Wrong again!! Now, I have a book but I still have to call to ask and confirm any move I do.  If it is not possible to be accurate with the opening/closing times, it is better not to say anything about them 
 Amazon.com notified us there was a new Unf. Events book!  Wow, Great, Order it! Not one mention that it is only a blank journal. Amazon, this is wrong 
 I've at various times subscribed to Stuff, Maxim, and FHM magazines.  Stuff was the only one I ended up not resubscribing to.  It has its moments and the photography is fine.  I would describe it as Maxim's younger brother.  It's whole attitude seems to be like the younger sibling of the popular kid in high school, and this kid then tries to be hip by being just as funny, etc., but it is forced and very juvenile.  It just is snarky and predictable after awhile.  On the other hand, I'm not 21 anymore either, and maybe if I was in my 20's I would find this the height of humor 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 This toy is a piece of junk. I can't believe Disney actually did any testing whatsoever on this toy. An adult can't even get it to work. The car is supposed to sense the infrared light in front of it and follow, but all it does is jerk forward a teeny bit and then stop. If anything, it senses when the light clicks off and then it jerks forward a little bit. We read the instructions and saw that the car does not work well in bright lighting conditions so we took it down to the dark basement (as if my son should actually be expected to only play with this car in the dark!) but it didn't even work there.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT on Christmas morning that we had to wait 8 hours for it charge, and then even BIGGER disappointment the next morning when we finally got to play with it and it didn't work. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY 
 Read the Unbox terms of use CAREFULLY before choosing this route over a regular DVD purchase.  It is not your usual set of "blah blah" legal jargon.  For example, 3c: "Removal of Software. If you uninstall or otherwise remove the Software, your ability to view all Digital Content you have downloaded to the Authorized Device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all Digital Content from that Authorized Device without notice to you."  If you ever remove the Unbox software, Amazon may revoke your ability to view the Firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine!  Amazon, I've ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience; why did you let Unbox create these anti-customer terms of use?? 
 Bernard Hermman's score is magnificent.  This was a major let down for me considering it was directed by Truffaut.  Lacked any real suspense and edge.  Boring camera work for the most part.  Some nice editing touches here and there but overall pretty lackluster.  The acting was fine...I guess.  It was just a pointless story I felt that really didn't go anywhere.  And what was with that crummy ending 
 Although it kept time (which indicates the batteries were good) this didn't work the first day I used it. It worked the second day. It stopped working by the third day AND the battery cover broke off sometime during the day and was lost. This was a complete waste of $19 
 but i ordered it and amazon sent me an entirely different product. I got ordered the leapfrog and received a generic product. pretty deceptive actually. not happy 
 This book got great reviews and was recommended to me by someone whose taste I trust, but I've got to say, I just don't understand its appeal.  It starts out as mildly intriguing, and some of the scenes with the unwed mothers in the first section are evocative, but the lovably twinkly and clairvoyant old nun is just too saccharine to bear, and the narrator of the middle section, salt-of-the-earth gardener Son, is not only too good to be true, he's also deathly boring--a dull-witted drone.  I've read Bel Canto and The Patron Saint of Liars only confirms my belief that Ann Patchett's novels are overrated.  
 This book sucks so bad.  All of the redundant crap that everyone makes  kids read about the Holocaust is so depressing.  We all understand that  WWII was a terrible thing and that the Axis forces did hideous things to  Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, Poles, etc.  Do we have to keep reading about  it?  I feel like my brain has been drained!  It's all so depressing, so  negative.  Move on, people.  I might sound insensitive...sure, this was an  atrocious thing and deeply affected those involved, but move on.  My priest  says that we bear our own crosses.  The Holocaust is NOT going on now.  We  need to learn from what happened (I have!) and MOVE ON 
 There is no doubt that this tea does it's job, but the smell of it is awful. I normally don't have any problems eating or drinking mildly offensive things, but I have such an aversion to the smell of this tea. It has a top note of moldy, dank earth with a base note of acrid peppers gone bad. The box says that it contains "delicious sasparilla". I don't taste anything like sasparilla or rootbeer in it at all. If you can bear the smell and aftertaste then go for it 
 I bought this over the top "chick flick" for my wife and 13 year old daughter.  I stay out of the room when they need a fix 
 I purchased this book hoping for an objective, scholarly history of the life of Mary Magdalene.  However, this book is little more than an assortment of personal attacks on the beliefs of Christianity and the Catholic Church cleverly marketed as a biography.  In typical propaganda-slinging fashion, she paraphrases and condemns writings, events and individuals that go against her personal views while accepting and embracing those that support her beliefs.  While Ms. Picknett clearly conducted a large amount of research, she obviously has many deep personal issues with the church that would be better sorted out through counseling and therapy rather than through the publishing of books.  She condemns the Catholic Church for the (unfortunately) many bad practices of the past without really acknowledging all the good work and teachings done by the vast majority of its members throughout history.  This is analagous with tearing down the entire present-day educational system because of some bad teachers that were around centuries ago.  She certainly needs to learn how to distinguish between occasional faulty leadership versus a faulty organization.  A few bad apples do not always spoil the whole bunch.  This discrete "it's either all good or all bad" line of thinking, coupled with the one-sided iconoclastic attempts to destroy the image of Jesus, are pathetic at best and have no place in any text aimed at those seeking to make up their own minds through an objective presentation of facts 
 I like Feinstein's work but this book is a bore. The first 100 pages are mini-biographies of USGA staff. Someone out there must find interesting which college basketball team is the favorite of the USGA publicity director, but I am at loss to understand whom 
 Short Answer: No  This caught my attention on HBO because I noticed that the producers are a bunch of former and current Pro Baseball Players. An opening day pity rebroadcast must explain why it was shown at all.  The characters would have been stock characters if any of them were even developed that far. This movie gets it so wrong that it isn't even clear that the jocks dominate the school, whether the psycho in the pickup is a jock or not, whether the hot girls are popular or hermits, whether the dorks are oppressed or just slightly less popular. I think all the nerds get laid without even much of an effort. When even timeworn cliches are beyond the comprehension of the writing staff it might be time to consider writing something less complicated; maybe the "hip" slogans on a McDonalds bag. Let the Family Guy Manatees write films like this, its their specialty.  Even the appearances of the hot girls are screwed up. None of them are in it more than about 4 minutes total and they don't have much to do but stand around. How hard is it to have a scene where someone visits a beach or has a car wash? Its been done in teen movies since the 50s. Its really hard to screw that part up. It was screwed up here.  I'm glad baseball is back in season so that a sequel is less likely 
 buzz is the same cocky,thunder stealing jerk from toy story.buzz must defeat zurg,the evil emporer in this one.this is up in space and nobody from toy story except those 2 and the green aliens from pizzaplanet are in it.the kids will watch it but will probably prefer toy story and toy story 2.those too are so far superior even the kids recognize it.theres really not much to say except i hope they dont make anymore 
 While I only paid $5.99, that was still WAY too much for such a horrible recording! All the songs sound tinny and like they were recorded in a can. Even the "transfered from analog tape" disclaimer doesn't excuse the poor quality. I'd take it back if I could. My advice is find the vinyl and make your own CD!! 
 What a disappointment! Poorly written, bitter, jealous and small minded. Less said the better 
 It what amounts to nothing more then an attack by a leftist writer, Fitzgeralds focus is to demean the charcater of a great president. Weather he was a bumbling ... or was just acting, like in his movies, fitzgerald argument does not deal with the fact that when Ronald Reagan entered office the Cold War had never been colder, and by the time he left office it was essentialy over. Was it a matter of luck that the collapse of the Soviet Empire occured on the watch of the most anti-communist president in the history of the country? Fitzgerald can theorize anything she/he pleases, but ask the Russians what impact Star Wars had on their demise 
 this idea is nice but, the tray is hard to fit up to your child its tight or too loose were food is in there lap.  next the tray is hard to get off and wash. next mine came with a tray to cover or use as a tray, and that is really hard to get off, by the time i got it off i was ready toss it in the trash. unless you are super woman i would not bu 
 Incredible does describe this movie- incredibly bad! This movie doesn't know what it wants to be. At times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of "Mississippi Burning" or the anger and impunity of "Ghosts of Mississippi", or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre. At other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of 2 of its main actors, Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock. As a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre's list of movies for lack of originality, and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make. Some of my favorite actors are wasted, either by being given cliched dialogue, over acting, or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence. If this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book, then I have no interest in reading the book. I'm sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper. But the direction doesn't guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own.  Bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role, proving she's only worthy of b-grade "Miss Congeniality" type crud.  McConaughey over acts so much (as can be said for Keifer Sutherland and others) that it can be said he balances out the under acting of Patrick McGoohan, Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland. Samuel L. Jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever, but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in.  Even the extras in this movie are horrible. Enough can't be said about the terrible direction in this movie, equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault, making Sergio Leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison. This is not "a powerful film." It's a powerful attempt at using a big name cast, a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience, and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions, culminating in an over the top, pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by McConaughey that wouldn't hold water in any real court of justice. Maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt, or because they haven't seen quality comparisons and classics like "Mississippis Burning," that has both a great script and fabulous acting. I don't know. All I know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started. Among the top of my most over rated movies 
 This book poorly explains the concepts needed to understand C++.  It is advertised as an introductory book, however, this book will only be useful with one or more semesters of exerpience with C or C++. The books only saving grace is that if you are studying for the AP, this book uses the STL dirived AP classes that you will need to be familar with.  If you arn't taking the comp sci AP there is no reason to even  consider using this book 
 In a perfect world this book would be 100% correct.  Global warming is a problem.  Poverty is a tragedy.  Immigration is a fact.  A `war on want' would be nice.  But in order to fight the `war on want' one must first eradicate hatred, intolerance, racism, nazism, Islamism, communism, terrorism and all other types of -isms.  Throwing food at intolerant hateful people doesn't make the problem go away, it just makes them hungrier.  This book ignores fact and whitewashes the world.  England is not `caught between America and Europe'  rather England is being taken over by intolerance.  But it is intolerance towards the west that sweeps the world today.  See Immigrants don't have a `natural right' to immigrate where they please.  In fact the greatest threat today is that countries in Europe, namely Holland and France, will be overrun by immigrants in the next 20 years plunging the European continent into another dark age.  In order to fight the war on poverty that will supposedly solve all the worlds problems one first has to learn the lesson of the Marshall plan.  You have to first beat your enemy into submission before you raise him up in your image.  This was the approach used in Germany and Japan in 1945 and it has succeeded.  If this book were to have suggested this policy, it would be accurate, but simply throwing money at a problem only makes the problem worse, Africa is a showcase of this.  There are 50 times the amount of aid organizations in Africa today then in 1960, and yet Africans are poorer today.  How is that possible?  It is because of misguided ideas like these.  Seth J.

 Don't waste your time on this "movie" unless you take stupid for funny 
 After reading the numerous positive reviews for this phone, I purchased.  Here are the main issues I have found with this phone:  1) The buttons are too small, particularly the main control button.  You have to used the side of your fingers to ensure that you do not hit too buttons at the same time. And, believe me, I do not have very large hands.  2) If you have quite a few contacts in your phone, you will be irritated by the delay when you scroll down quickly to select a contact.  You will notice that if you are not careful, you will dial the wrong contact due to the delay when scrolling and selecting quickly, so if this is you, be aware.  3) You must open the cover and look inside to see if you have missed a call or have a message.  VERY INCONVENIENT!!  There is no indication to show this on the top screen, only the inside screen.  4) On occasion, the display on the outside of the phone stops working entirely.  What you just need to do is power the phone down and they back up again.  Not optimal, and I probably just got a bad phone, but I am just waiting for the situation to get more frequent, so I can then deal with the likely nightmare of having to get a replacement phone from Motorola.  NOTE:  I have no personal vendetta against Motorola, but wanted to provide some real feedback rather than all just rosey stuff I bought into before purchasing 
 I read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the "educated" aspect, Bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents).  I started into "In a Sunburned Country" with similar expectations, and especially since I have always longed and planned to visit Australia.  To state that I was disappointed is a severe understatement.  After reading this book I now have little to no desire to visit the "land down under;" my only hope is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson's book so that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!)  My best estimate is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about Australia.  During and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  I have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as I did with this one.  Bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a "story" relayed second-hand from one of the Australians he "met."  Such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books.  The only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  These, at least, provided for some interesting reading.  After comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of Bryson's books ("I'm A Stranger Here Myself") after she read "A Walk in the Woods," it would appear that "In a Sunburned Country" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has churned out.  Perhaps he isn't a "one hit wonder," but I for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out.  So, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided in "A Walk in the Woods," look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed.  
 I'm a senior at Oglethorpe University, minoring in English, and I have to say I was disappointed in having this text as my last assignment in our class "The Child in Literature" and as my last English assignment ever.  I found the characters flat and the symbolism overt and unengaging.  At first I thought that the children acted the way I expected them to because they are children.  Children are easily manipulated by their environment.  But as the book progressed, the reader could see each character take the expected turns, and land in the expected outcomes.  Cody needed a father, throughout the entire novel, so obviously he will emulate his father in his adult life.  Jenny is a brilliant girl searching for real companionship, so her end is just as predictable.  And Ezra.  From the monopoly scene in the beginning to defeat in his love life, I never once thought he would veer from that path, and end up any differently than he did.  A book that does not challenge it's readers, and does not invoke any hope in a different outcome, is a very flat and disappointing book.  Even the food symbols, or the name associations, or the exact mirrored images of some of the characters (Luke and his game, or Luke and his recorder, anyone?) are blatently handed out and explained.  I like what Tyler was trying to do, and I can take the characters for what they are, and maybe enjoy them, but as someone who loves to remove the author's intention and just delve into a text, this book upsets me.  Tyler leaves literally no room for interpretation at all.  That might make her a "good" writer, but it certainly doesn't make it a good book.  A book you can't discuss or argue over the meaning of seems pointless.  I can see myself in every one of those characters, but I didn't learn anything from it.  This, to me, seems like light beach reading.  Though the subject is so dark, I don't think I could even recommend it for that. 
 The title and reviews give the impression that this book is a collection of the black arts and secrets of analog design.  It isn't.  80% of the chapters are old-timers' "when I were a lad" stories.  It's not necessarily a bad book - it's highly entertaining and well-written, and new graduates will find the real-life hints and caveats useful, but if you have more than a few years of experience in the industry, don't expect to be educated. 
 This video was not very interesting.  Neither Pamela Anderson nor Charlie Sheen can act their way out of a paper bag.  Although Pamela has her physical attributes to her credit, they can't carry the video.  This was my first venture into the Scary Movie set and it probably will be my last.         
 such as painting a room, or cleaning the kitchen, these books are entertaining as audio books.  At the risk of sounding "snobbish" (which I am not) they are a cross between "Murder She Wrote" and Mr. Ed.  
 Again we have some Christians trying to escape biblical and moral requirements.  We have a problem with religion today in that many want to be a Catholic for example but can not comply with the rules.  Each religion does have a moral path or rules of engagement.   According to Lev. 18 it is a blasphemy for a man to lay with another man.  Jesus himself does not directly say that homosexuality is wrong but he does not attack most sin.  He does however make it clear to "keep my fathers laws".  There are 613 LAWS from G_d (the father) and Lev 18 is of course is part of them.   Christians seem to be occupied with homosexuality though there are many sins just as bad under the eyes of G_D.   Christians have historically denied the commandment of Jesus to keep his fathers laws  and those two in Mark 12 28-32 and thus by history or culture refuse most of them. Examples of this are: Exodus 20 4th comm. SABBATH, Kosher food laws and many more.  Its as though Christianity was allowed (so it would seem) to pick and choose what G_d wanted.    Jews look at this issue like this:  The laws were given to the "chosen" and therefore Gentiles must only follow the 7 laws of Noah in Genesis 9. The laws for the Gentiles (NOAH was the first GOYEM-Gentile)  These by the way are paraphrased in Mathew.  So, to a JEW its fine for a Christian to be gay as the laws of NOAH do not state homosexuality as a sin.  Now, there are Catholics and other denominations of Christianity who over the course of history have made sure that certain sins are still treated as such.  This is partly the influence of Paul and the Nicean Council.  If one is a Catholic and is also a homosexual then by the doctrine of this faith you must either repent or leave the faith.  I dont understand why so many try to justify loop holes.  If ones son for example is gay and they are Catholic or for that matter Orthodox Jew then they must be forgiven but...they can not be of that faith.  Rules of engagment.   I am a adult male and can not join the girl scouts becuase of my age and gender. Religions have rules too and if you are unable to follow them by the "book" then try one you can.  Its very simple.  Besides, why belong to a faith or any group that goes against your lifestyle?  Its like a JEW wanting to be a member of the KKK  or a gay man wanting to be Catholic. Rules are rules.   
 This book is more about feel good stories of people who started a business and they liked what they were doing.  If you liked Chicken Soup for the Soul, you will probably like this.  I was looking for a book to give some  ideas of what good businesses someone could do part-time and make some  extra money.  These stories covered various set up costs and barely gave an  idea of what is needed.  The book basically sums up to be: Find out what  you like and make a plan.  If you already figured that out, don't buy the  book 
 I bought a non digital Vornado in the past and it still works fine.  This digital Vornado was fine in the beginning, but after a short while, the digital temperature readout was scrambled and the fan and heat didn't work.  I'll get a replacement Vornado but it won't be this model 
 I found this book was written like a comedy but because it only made me laugh once it was just silly. Comedy is one of those itchy things that you either get it, and love it or you don't. I didn't. I found the dialect frustrating: It was supposed to be set in Kent but the dialect read more like northern England, you have to read it slower to work out what is being said and in doing so you lose your attention slightly which takes the edge off the humour to the extent that you're not even aware that humour is present. At least that's what it was like for me. Whatever the nasty thing in the cowshed was isn't explained in the end but you're left feeling that there is a hint of bestiality that didn't really suit the book, being or trying to be a comedy, hence the lack of explanation. I've given it two stars because when Gibbons takes a step back and looks at the overall picture she has a great way of describing scenes 
 As far as police procedurals go, this is sort-of ok.  For my taste though, the characters are a little flat and too one dimensional.  I could not get through this bland piece of soft-boiled prose and had to put it down unfinished. I found Banks and his companions very wooden and not believable. Excluding the victim, there was not enough to go on to feel any true sympathy for the other characters.  The plot line IS interesting but gets to a point of being turgid. Perhaps I'll give it another try someday 
 This Canadian movie has a hard time being taken seriously, since so many of the people interviewed move away from the subject of oil and work through their personal issues with the aesthetics and lifestyle of suburban living, SUV, wal-mart, k-mart, etc - quite a lot of screen time is spent on this issue rather than the supposed core subject of "peak oil."  This film, much like "An Inconvenient Truth" would have us all living in soviet style apartment blocs. That's a hard sale. Good luck with it. 
 I'm by no means a parrot expert but do know a fair amount about nutrition. Honestly, I found this book lacking much *parrot specific* information at all. The author admits that most of the information is based on human nutrition info because not a lot is known about parrot nutrition. (Granted, if true, this isn't the author's fault ... except the book's title might be less misleading if it were "Recipes your Parrots Might Enjoy").   The book, though, was basically a listing of nutrients and their functions in the body, followed by a bunch of recipes that I could easily get from any cookbook or online. The most "novel" recipe suggestion was to leave the egg shells on the eggs in your parrots' recipes?   What I was hoping for were some guidelines about parrot nutrition, as compared with human nutrition. Maybe if, in addition to the recipes, there were some suggested feeding schedules (so one could get an idea about  relationship between the parrots' needs for fat, protein, carbs, etc.) that would be helpful.   I did learn conures need less protein and more vitamin K than other parrots. Unfortunately, though, this book leaves me with no idea about how much protein and vitamin K "other parrots" need. Or carlories or carbs or ...   There were also some factual problems with this book. Banana peels may be contaminated with monkey urine? Maybe this was a joke but it didn't stand out as such, in such a "fact free" environment. Also, the bit about the dark part of fruit flesh, around the seed, being toxic? I can't find anything coroborating this online.   It was good that she spoke out against all-seed diets and promotes the idea of fresh, home-cooked food for parrots. The book provides a summary of nutrition information that I might pull out once in a while but only because this book isn't as heavy as my "real" nutrition book but otherwise, not that useful. We eat fairly healthy ourselves and we'll share our food with our parrot, in addition to added nuts and fruits. Other than trying to add some vitamin K to our future BCC's diet, nothing else different than we'd planned to do.   Wish I'd checked this book out from the library instead of spilling out the cash for it. Had I checked it out first, I definitely wouldn't have purchased it 
 I received this book as a gift, and found it unreadable. For example, EFS says cost/benefit analysis "is a procedure by which the higher is reduced to the level of the lower and the priceless is given a price". This is meaningless rhetoric to me. It also assumes that only economics provides a guide to human behavior. Or that all economic analysis is totally rational. Schumacher questioned every assumption of "economic science" using theories from the anarchist tradition. Schumacher claimed neocolonialism is the result of politics, not economic principles. But doesn't class and sectional interests drive politics? His advocacy of a search for inward spiritual space, and a rejection of the real world of politics and economics, makes this book part of the problem and not part of the solution.  The 'Introduction' says Gandhi wanted to use "labor-intensive manufacture and handicrafts" (p.5). Milovan Djilas said it was important for newly liberated countries to use mass production ("The New Class"). The historical record over the past centuries should tell you who was right or wrong. Liberating revolutions result in more production and other benefits for the people; else they're not liberating. Unlimited economic growth overlooks the availability of basic resources and the capacity of the environment. But there's always some natural problem that causes a correction.  This is a very verbose book whose arguments rest on unquestioned assumptions. Since it was published in 1973 Thatcher's regime destroyed Britain's coal industry to make them dependent on imported oil and gas. We've seen what happened after they divided and privatized the railroads. But who benefited from these political decisions?   Part II Chapter 3 notes that western Europe "deliberately destroyed nearly half of their coal industries". But the economy in neocolonialist countries will always suffer to benefit the imperialist ruling country. American was a net petroleum exporter until 1967, and influenced Saudi Arabia and Iran (just like Great Britain did previously). You can also consider the actions of Jimmy Carter against nuclear reactors. France and Japan use nuclear power, they have no oil. Saudi Arabia uses nuclear power so they can profitably sell their oil abroad. Those who criticized this book showed good judgment and wisdom. You can read this book and judge its worth for yourself. 
 ¿Por qué se le ocurrió a Tim Burton hacer un remake de este clásico? El resultado no puede ser peor... Sólo fui a verla porque sale Tim. Que vestido de primate resultes igual de atractivo y apasionado que siempre es lo único que vale la pena de toda la historia.  Tus ojos siguen emitiendo fuego. ¡Qué no se apague nunca! You Are The Best! 
 Line by line the writing is superb. Ford has an eye for making insignificant detail seem important. But here may be the problem with ID. The constant shift to describing everything in the narrator's line of vision confuses my sense of what's relevant. Every other page is a distraction from something I wasn't sure about to begin with 
 What a disastrously bad and unfunny novel.  The self-involved main character is pathetic and whiny, the "plot" is see-through and cliched, and the writing style is far below what can be found on any mediocre blog.  When people criticize chick lit, this is exactly the kind of book they're talking about.  It's shallow to such a shocking degree than when it tries to take itself seriously, or stretches for a literary flourish, it's absolutely cringe-worthy.  I find it hard to believe the people who've praised it here actually read the same book.  This was given to me by an acquaintance shortly after my engagement.  She said she didn't really like it but thought it would be "more my kind of thing."  Obviously not a person who knows me well.  Thankfully, it doesn't appear the author is terribly prolific, so readers don't need to worry about trying to stumble through page after page of show-offy navel-gazing.  I wouldn't say it's one of the worst books I've read, but it's certainly one of the most useless 
 But, still, don't waste your money. If you must read this, get it from the library and buy a book here from a real American like Al Franken 
 It's over thirty years since I read GAUDY NIGHT and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON. I don't suppose I'll ever read them again. By the time she wrote them, Sayers had lost whatever she had to offer as a mystery writer. She was taking herself seriously. In Harriet Vane, Sayers produced perhaps the most nauseating wish fulfilment figure in the whole of crime fiction. She makes Jemima Shore look like something out of Dostoyevsky. Avoid like the plague unless you wish to gross out on snobbery and sentimentality. And the murder method in BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON is singularly unconvincing 
 This was the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. Don't waste your money. 
 The late Julian L. Simon who decimated (and won a bet) with Paul Ehrlich summed up Mr. Gore's effort quite nicely: "The book is as ignorant a collection of cliches as anything ever published on the subject."  And, "Just about every assertion  in the book points in the wrong direction - suggesting that  conditions are getting worse rather than better, which they are."  Mr. Simon then discusses the following subjects on which Mr. Gore was WRONG:  soil erosion; hardwood trees; DDT; Agent Orange; Love Canal.  Finally, Mr. Simon states:  "And the entire book is filled with this sort of environmental gossip, backed by no sources, and contradicted by solid data."     These quotes are from Mr. Simon's "Hoodwinking the Nation" which has some excellent chapters on "media shaped opinion" and the mis-use of statistics, sampling techniques and data which every citizen should read 
 i read the reviews before purchasing this cd but did not listen to any samples. the reviews for this cd were so good and i had previously bought 2 cd's by israel kamakawiwo that are great - i thought i couldn't go wrong  with this one.  WRONG.  this cd in my opinion is horrible.  can't even  listen to it 
 We had the unit for two months before one of the controllers started giving an E 4 error message. Keep you documentation including receipt and warranty.

 Corkscrew has a nice heavy duty feel and does a good job of getting the cork out once you get the corkscrew into the cork and that is where the problem lies.  Usually (but not always) Oxo products are good at making things easier to do.  I have yet to figure out what they had in mind when they designed this one.  Getting the screw into a cork is no better than a run of the mill winged corkscrew and probably worse because it is so bulky.  You also have to hold hard onto the body to keep if from turning while you are getting the screw into the cork.  Poor design this time OXO. 
 I personally do a vast amount of reading with lean enterprise being of special interest. Womack has done some great work, but this is a "tough read" even for serious lean enthusiasts. I typically finish a book of this length within 2-3 days then re-read it and highlight. It literally took me 11 weeks because I was lulled to a point in which reading further would be of no benefit and would have to put it back on the shelf and revisit it days later. I realize that scholarly and business writing is not especially exciting as I am constantly reading and doing research but this one was tough even for me, an avid reader 
 Egan is a good writer, but in this book she does not transport us.  It feels as though she is distracted.  The research leaves a little something to be desired.  Lastly, the book seems to have a need for a brand of drama that fuels the imaginations of 18 year olds. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
 Here are some words from the Big Printer in the Sky:  "The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak." -Hans Hoffman  By the time I got to the dynamite the gun powder was wet and soggy 
 The writer has such talent for making everything truly convincing, that I was very disappointed to realise, as I read, that this was really fiction. Too many inconsistencies and oddities. Kokopelli in Manitoba? boy, he's a long way from home! I've travelled in the South-West and known Navajo people, and Lakotas in South Dakota, and I've lived in Canada, though not Manitoba, and the points made by those who describe that western province are very convincing. No way do Andrews' descriptions ring true.   The clincher was where at the end Andrews is strictly enjoined not to tell anyone of her experiences: she asks "what should I do" and is told "Write a book!" I think Andrews is almost slapping the more gullible readers upside the head!   And it's sad, because on its own terms, it does in some ways convey a quite meaningful view of the world, and encourages us to be open to the deeper meanings and the spiritual connections and resonances of the natural world.  So I wish it were a real account, but as it isn't, I have to feel that such transformations of reality must do more harm than good. What happened to a medieval Christian when it was proved that the famous saint's relic everyone had revered was the bone of a dog's hind leg? Didn't it hurt the faith that had sustained him, and damage the good that was in that faith? Other reviewers have mentioned more accurate, reality-based reports of the shaman's world: I'll have to follow some of those up. 
 Ok well this book SUCKED!!! It's all about baribie kara. I was actully at first thinking Kara wasn't that bad for a character but beacause of this book now I think shes not a good character anymore. This book made me got really dissapionted. I really like the series and I will still continue reading the series but if she is going to steal Emily's horn AGAIN then I might as well not read anymore books about Kara. 
 This book was first published in 1981, but later edited and republished with a new title in 1984.  The author was clearly influenced to change the direction of this book from the first printing because of his contact with YWAM, John Dawson, Richard Twiss, Daniel Kikawa and others who are hawking these same ideas.  Any good Christian anthropologist will tell you that history shows that, though most Gentile cultures had some sort of "supreme being" they worshipped, those "supreme beings" were one god among a pantheon of gods.  The Bible is clear that "from the creation of the world" all Gentile cultures had corrupted the knowledge of the true God.  Though the first printing of this book had some good ideas about cross-cultural methods to preach the Gospel to many cultures, the additions to this book prove clearly that it is unbiblical in its basic premise.  The new title "Eternity In Their Hearts: Startling Evidence of Belief in the One True God in Hundreds of Cultures Throughout the World" is an unbiblical statement.  Why do I say that?  Two verses end Richardson's unbiblical speculations:  Eph. 2:11-13  Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of  men)-remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now inChrist Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ. Rom. 10:14-15  How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news! 
 I am very disappointed with this book. I suppose my expectations were raised after seeing that the book was recommended by Dr. Christiane Northrup, M.D., one of my favorite authors, the sole reason I purchased Awakening Intuition.   "Awakening Intution" contains VERY little information concerning how one can develop or awaken his/her intuition. Indeed, the title is misleading and inappropriate. The book is mostly filled with case studies and examples (many tragic) of people who did not deal with emotional issues/thought patterns that subsequently caused disease/illness in their bodies. Mona Lisa focuses on illness  NOT the development of intuition.   I also dislike the author's writing style. While Mona Lisa Schulz does seem to have a healthy sense of humor, I think her writing is nonetheless terribly dry. Mona Lisa Schulz repeats herself throughout the book, which was poorly edited (it should be half as long). The book reads like one long chapter.  Again, rather than discussing intuition and how one can develop this quality, she focuses on her life as a medical student/neuropsychiatrist/neuroscientist and the patient/clients with whom she interacted. After 150 pages I felt sick.  I realize we each have our own tastes and many readers may actually enjoy the book. I, however, would most definitely not recommend this book. 
 This is a horrible excuse for a piece of literature.  Although her subject matter is occasionally rational, the repetition and horrible alliteration she uses is painful.  What should have been written in 3 concise chapters drags on for 18 mind-numbing ones.  I reccommend that no one reads this book as it was a waste of a quite a bit of my time, although I do commend her on her efforts to enlight the world on the ever-present environmental problems that we face on a daily basis 
 This is the worst book I've read on critical thinking and logic. The examples the author uses are terrible....quite dull 
    Good photography and camera work! Writing was poor and I found the movie to be a great waste of good acting talent from good actors! Although the movie was meant to be a horror flick I personally don't like it when evil rules and the devil wins in the end. Other than that the constant negativity was occasionally well glossed over with some fine nudity. I will be giving my copy away. I probably should burn it 
 There is a single idea that permeates Koons work. This idea is neither good, nor original, nor indeed - since it has been 70 years since Duchamps "Fountain" - particularly exciting. If there were a "Ladybird book of Modern Art", Jeff's saccharine,  'easyfun' work would be that book.  Koons art-as-commodity schitck would be more convincing if the buying public had to decide. His commodities fail  as commodities - their status as art, is, of course guaranteed, since (see Duchamp) he has told us it is so.  Show me one more Scots Terrier made of flowers and I shall reach for my Uzi in a frenzy of post-modern criticis 
 I love the Avatar and I was so thrilled that amazon allows people to download it except the only problem is I've been trying for the past days and darn it all, it's not working!!! It's not as if I'm downloading it for free. I am willing to pay and yet it just wouldn't go through!!! I think it's better to just buy the dvds...I think it's absolutely horrible to tease customers like that.. 
 For average people who want a camera that just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this. I don't know about the specifics, but like other reviewers mine got stuck and quit working for no reason after a couple of months. So, I don't really see what all the bells and whistles are for if it doesn't even take a picture. It was fine while it worked, it ate batteries but the pics were good 
 I started reading this book because I found the plot amusing...but the middle seems to really drag, and the end is down right AWFUL.  As an American, I kept reading this book and wondering, "are the English REALLY this nuts?!?!" I'm also really sick of every book I pick up being set in London with the heroine working for a publishing house.  Is that all they do?! If you are really intrigued by this book, read a few chapters and skip to the end. About the only thing that really made me want to stand up and cheer through the entire book was when Christopher put Jane in her place.  He and David were my favorite characters 
 To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this book...  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't interested in a kiss and tell look into her life, but I have a feeling Tweed is much more interesting and entertaining than what this book suggests.  Most of the book covers her live moving from Canada to LA boucing from boring boyfriend to even duller boyfriend.  She finally meets Gene Simmons and she tells us how good there life is etc.  But she is obviously a hard worker, a survivor in LA movies, mixes with interesting people and is part of an intriguing relationship with Simmons - but there is little detail.  I found the "Family Jewels" DVD series far more satisfying and complimentary about her life.  For fans only.. 
 He bowed at a shinto shrine. He attends the Pagan rite at Bohemian Grove for the Cremation of Care. He belongs to the Order of Death also known as Skull and Bones. His wife says he milks male horses and that she enjoys male dancers.  Only the blind could think this is a description of a Bible believer 
 I bought this book thinking it would help my Arthritis and aid me in losing weight. I was so wrong.  The food was totally unpalatable. I could not even gag it down. I was hungry ALL THE TIME. I ate and ate and ate. My skin ,which was already dry, became like parchment paper.  I developed bumpy skin on the backs of my arms and on my thighs. I had no energy. It was the worst diet I have ever been on (and I've been on them all). Don't waste your money on the Mcdougall books. A better one would be Dr. Mary Enigs book, Eat Fat, Lose Fat. I went on this one and added cod liver oil to my diet and I lost 125 pounds in just under a year with almost NO hanging skin. This diet is rich in fat soluble vitamins which nourish the skin. I was never hungry and the bumps on my skin and my arthritis cleared up completely. This is the real way we are supposed to eat. Even if you think eating lots of saturated fat is bad, get the book anyway, by the time your done reading it, you will be a believer because you'll understand how and why the body uses nutrients the way it does. A book everyone should read. If I could give the Mcdougall books a '0' I would 
 I have no idea whether Morehouse's story is true, or completely made up, but I will say it reads like the latter. I don't believe in conpiracy theories in general not because I don't believe a government would do something bad, but that they could successfully cover it up. It's against all human nature not to talk, especially about something big, so I don't believe secrets are easy to keep nowadays. That said, Morehouse's book reads like badly-written, paranoid "sci-fi"...not a well-written book, neither believable nor entertaining 
 I love history.  I love Biblical history. It seemed as if the illustrator had a "proverbial gun to their head" to get all the text into "X" amount of pages -- thereby printing it every "which way" in order to accomplish this feat. It wasn't "cute" nor CLEAVER having to read spirals -- in a book that has so much GOOD INFORMATION -- that NOVELTY need not be included!!!  Due to this need for attention -- my score for this book which had been a five star rating did a nose-dive down to one star.  I went to a librarian's meet, where this was a "must read" and in the discussion attended by 30+ librarians, they indicated the "same thought!"  (If there is ever a) next edition -- think twice! 
 I LOVE John Grisham. I have read almost all his books, but this one.... I couldn't even read beyond the first hundred pages. It is so slow, a lot of narrative. It looks more like a history book than a thriller one. I didn't like at all 
 Vasari's classic text is well written (translated, I guess I should say) but extremely tiresome.  For nearly every artist he simply lists their works, and rarely with more analysis than by describing them as "life-like" or "beautiful."  For example, here is what he says about Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, one of his most famous and celebrated paintings: "He did a panel for the main altar containing Our Lady ascending into heaven, with the twelve apostles standing below her and watching her ascent, but since this work was painted on canvas and perhaps poorly cared for, little of it can be seen."  That's it.  The only exception to his utter factual tediousness is Michelangelo's Life, where, although he goes into almost no description of the works themselves besides his characteristic fulsomeness, he does provide some interesting anecdotes.  If you are looking to understand and analyze Renaissance art than this book will not help you.  If you are looking to engage in scholarly debate over the origins and documentations of the discussed works then you should probably read the original, unedited version in Italian anyway.

 This book tells you nothing that the U.C.C., Restatement 2nd, and a basic cases and examples book (Farnsworth, for instance) doesn't already tell you.  This hornbook, however, is much denser and dryer than these other texts.  Surely there must be better study texts out there than this for the first-year Contracts student.  To give you a taste of this literary castor oil, the first chapter asks the question, "What is a contract?"  Then it proceeds for paragraphs upon dense paragraphs about what some obscure academic once said a contract is.  Then C&P say that they don't like that explanation (without really explaining why very well).  This is repeated over and over again.  Then they conclude by saying, Golly gee, we'll be darned, but we really don't know what one of them contract thingies is, but we'll talk about them in the most boring way possible for the next several hundred pages using as many words as we possibly can in order to justify our royalties.  Later, the book covers history of contracts, and the concepts of debt, assumpsit, and covenant, but in a very dense and dry manner lacking in well-communicated insight (again, Farnsworth's casebook, for example, is much more direct and enlightening).  This is par for the course with C&P.  If you really want to understand Contract law better, just review various sections of the Restatement 2nd of Contracts, and the comments thereto.  That is a shorter and more direct read, and depending upon your law school, you probably have to know what the Restatement 2nd says anyway.  May as well get it straight from the horse's mouth instead of reading some law geeks overpostulate on it 
 I read this book on a suggestion from a friend, before I read "Reviving Ophelia", because she wanted to see if I would be as dissapointed with it as she was. I was more so. While there are some outstanding essays in this collection, the bias of the editor clearly stands out. There is no one for the outcasts to relate to. There was no musician, nor was there anyone that dealt with an alternative religion. There were no essays from people who had a different relationship with their parents than she had. The sections are poorly named and divided. All in all, it is an unworthy book to be associated with the original. Some girls it may "make feel less alone", but for me it only accentuated the differences. Definately take out from the library before you buy it 
 This book is so unreliable that I find it scary that anyone would give it a good review. Apparently, a number of readers have decided to engage in no critical thinking whatsoever. This book is frankly garbage. There are no footnotes or index. There is a tremendous reliance on unnamed sources.  Perhaps that is because no reputable intelligence agent wanted to be associated with this book.  Mr. Hayes is a neoconservative ideologue who I would not trust to write a reliable term paper for a freshman college class .  The Iraq- Saddam "connection" has been repudiated by Colin Powell himself. Recently, it was reported that President Bush received a top secret intelligence briefing on 9-21-01 that there was no alliance between Iraq and Al-Qaeda. Not that these facts matter to the neocon reviewers of this book.  Iraq is a hotbed of terrorism now because of our invasion. It was not before the war 
 I don't know if I could ever stress this more strongly for a DJ set. No matter what you read here, no matter if you think you're just like the people that love these discs, do yourself a favor and give this a listen first. Based on some opinions here I thought I'd be into it, instead I couldn't even sit through the length of either CD. That's just my tastes though.. 
 Great fan of Cassandra Wilson, especially her wonderful sense of instrumental colour in her arrangements. This, however, (maybe - probably - intentionally) is entirely different. The recording is just SO BAD that I can't really even listen to anything straight through. Hugely dissappointing if played on anything but a car radio (at speed) 
 This is by far the most pretentious piece of French crap I have seen in years. What bothers me are not the admittedly disturbing scenes, but rather the banality of the film's underlying idea, which the director, Gaspar Noe, attempted to convey in a thoroughly unremarkable fashion. The characters are not shown in any depth; in fact, there is no meaningful dialogue or any other attempt at all to introduce them to the viewer. Camera work is simply awful - somebody should have explained to the cameraman that rotating a hand-held camera at will for minutes at a time does not always produce art. Apparently, these sterile methods combined with shocking scenes of rape and murder are supposed to produce a new form of cinéma vérité.  In short, even though in France almost every baker is an "artiste" (think "baguette artisanale"), Mr. Noe is not a "cinéaste" even by French standards: hit someone in the face with a teakettle and call it art 
 There are many things that in my mind make this guide absolutely worthless.  1)  It's full of spoilers.  If you accidentally look ahead, it will give away parts of the plot.  Why they chose to document the entire story in this guide, I have no idea.  2)  They use a microscopic font on some of the pages that can only be read with a magnifying glass.  I'm far sighted so it is especially difficult for me.  3)  The organization is very poor.  They have a section at the end called "100 Secrets of FFXII".  To read through it though, you have to wade through a bunch of spoilers.  None of these secrets are referenced as you go through the walkthrough either, so you will have to read them all at once if you want to know what they are.  Take some lessons from how they did the Dragon Quest VIII guide, Brady.  No spoilers!  All we need are maps, hidden stuff, and sidequests.  Terrible guides can ruin a great game.  Don't use this one and you will enjoy the game a lot more 
 collective soul had a few nice attempts toward pop music like dosage. The main problem i have with this album is none of the songs are hits so no airwaves and the fact that the album probably has about 7 fillers! Its just to flawed to recommend to everyone it may be if you are a diehard collective soul fans. i wouldnt lose this album but i wouldnt buy it again 
 I bought one and it worked great. At first it's hard to manuever because it's really hot, and the barrel's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot, but once you get used to it, it does a stellar job of straightening your hair. Around 6 months into using the straightner, the machine slowly overheated and died. Thinking I had a faulty model, I went out and bought a new one. Guess what ? A few months into THAT one, it ended the same way.  So basically, not worth it. 
 What's the deal with glorifying gangster behavior?  This cat is a poor role model for youngsters with his swagger and gangster affectations.  The author needs to straighten out this feline 
 I admire David Kushner's writing skills - he can tell a good story and seems to do the needed research. I loved his "Masters of Doom".   "Jonny Magic" is the story of Jon Finkel, who transformed himself from being an overweight, bullied teenage nerd who could play a great game of Magic into a 20-something millionaire who mastered the casinos and could play a great game of Poker. He lost weight, rode the crest of the (still) current Poker phenomenon, and belongs right up there in the "Useless People Hall of Fame" along with various winners of reality, survival, and celebrity programs. Finkel became successful at something of no real use to society. And Kushner misses that aspect of the story. It's not that Finkel didn't have great talent, and he did accomplish something admired by many. Kushner tells that story, although - as others have observed - the book lacks drama, and is actually a little boring. But just ponder the difference between the "two Johns" in "Masters of Doom" and the "one Jon" in "Jonny Magic", and you have the makings of a really interesting story. Still untold.   A lot changed in the few years between the era of "Masters of Doom" and that of "Jonny Magic". Finkel's life says much about the world we live in today. It's really unfortunate that Kushner is not taking the lead in writing about this, since he has been commenting on parts of it for the past dozen years, and should have some perspective by now. There is room for good journalism in these topics, and I think Kushner has the skills to produce it. Instead, he settled for a quick write about a hot topic, once again repeating the pattern of "Wow - look at this - a genius nerd becomes a success and has the last laugh."   
 While I admit it is an interesting concept to incorporate this brass style music with an indie/rufus wainwright twist. One can't help but be bored to sleep with the same sound over and over. An ambitious undertaking yes... but unfortunately Neutral Milk Hotel was way more eclectic with the use of the brass and DID NOT OVERUSE it like beirut does. Every time I put this on I feel like I'm part of some international parade looking for a way ou 
 I work at Monte Sano State Park and when I compared the section about the "Plateau Loop Trail" (also known as the North Plateau Loop and South Plateau Loop) with our trail map (which is not, as is stated in the book, 50 cents, but $2.00 because it is a very detailed and excellent map) I saw numerous mistakes.  Firstly, only a very fast and experienced hiker could do the entire trail in an hour.  I can do the North Plateau Loop in 40 minutes, but that is at a fast pace, and it is only 1.2 miles, whereas the entire loop is about 4.8 miles.  Also, hiking is not free at the park.  There is an admission fee for all hikers, bikers and picnickers.  One of the "ruins" the author describes is the site of a lodge built several years ago, which is used for meetings and events.  Some of the landmarks and cross-trails he describes are not correct, and he doesn't even mention where the North Plateau Loop crosses the road that leads into the park! Someone unfamiliar with that trail would have difficulty picking it up on the other side of the road, as it is not easy to see. He also has the Bog Trail meet up with the South Plateau Loop twice before it meets with the Mountain Mist Trail, where it actually meets it the second time after the intersection of the Mountain Mist Trail.  There are so many mistakes in this one trail description that I wonder how many other trail descriptions are in error.  As far as Monte Sano State Park goes, we have twenty miles of hiking and/or biking trails, and your best bet would be to come to the park and purchase one of our trail maps, and if possible talk to one of the rangers, who are extremely knowledgable about the park trails.  And a $2.00 accurate map is certainly better than an inaccurate $13.00 book 
 Unfortunately, I have not received the item.  It's been 4.5 weeks since I placed the order.  I am reviewing this a low star, it should not take this long to receive a magazine subscription 
 Having been a casual fan of Stax records for a few years; I decided earlier this year that I should go all out and splurge on this 9-CD box set. Big mistake.  I have many, many complaints about this set; but what it basically boils down to is that this whole set is an absolute mess. It misses many key B-sides such as Otis Redding's "Hard To Handle" and Booker T & The MG's "Tic Tac Toe"; and doesn't even include every a-side the label released, despite the title of the compilation (where are the sides that Hoyt Johnson released for the label?). The linear notes by Steve Greenberg (the man who gave us that phony "Soul Queen" Joss Stone; and the headache-inducing Baha Men) are horrible, mostly focusing on his personal opions of the artists and/or songs rather than the stories behind them. And within the sections for each disc in the booklet; they entries aren't actually arranged in any particular order (least of all the order of the tracks on the CDs, that would make too much sense). And there should've been more photos, too.  Add to this the set's main problem: the music. The fact is that most of the songs on here are really lame. Seriously. "Why did you buy it, then?" I hear you say. Well; the Stax songs I was familiar with (such as "Green Onions"; "B-A-B-Y"; "You Don't Miss Your Water"; "(Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay"; "Soul Man"; "Born Under A Bad Sign" etc) are all great songs. "Well, why don't you like this set then" you're thinking. Answer: because the 30-or-so great songs on here are sandwiched between over 200 filler songs over 9 discs.  If you think I'm being harsh on these songs, I'm not; I can appreciate songs like Wendy Rene's "Bar-B-Q" and the Memphis Nomad's "Don't Pass Your Judgement"; but aside from a few good numbers and a few pleasent-but-dull numbers, most of the non-hits on here are pretty bad.  Basically, if you really like a Stax artist then go and buy a best-of for that artist; if your looking for a sampler of Stax's best songs, then go and buy the 4-CD Stax Story; don't bother with this one 
 Description implies that the entire toy is filled when in reality only the cat's head contains catnip.  The tail is an extremely thin strip.  I was very disappointed seeing as how I ordered three toys.  I had to ship them back and lose $6 for the shipping they charged to send it to me.  
 This may be the most overrated book in network marketing.  Don't get me wrong.  John Milton Fogg is a heck of a writer.  This "fable" is truly an extraordinary read, filled with wonderful images and seemingly heart-felt sentiment.  A page-turner, the reader whisks through the story of a novice networker's breath-taking encounter with the Greatest Networker in the World.  From a Japanese Restaurant to a hot bath to a baseball diamond to an opportunity meeting, the reader really believes that he (or she) is learning the secret to true networking success.  As such, this book has been heralded as the "classic" for the industry. (I must confess that I once was a believer.)  It's easy to come away from this book after a first reading thinking, "so this is what I'm missing."  Fogg has a gift.  The problem, however, is that there is nothing that Fogg presents that truly helps someone "do" the networking business, and do it well.  There is nothing written in the book that justifies the feeling of discovery that the first reading bestows.  Moreover, Fogg presents no authentic insight.  Instead, this book is empty.  It promises a "secret," almost Gnostic, knowledge of the inner-game of MLM, but never delivers.  It certainly leaves the reader hungry for more; but hungry because there was no food in the first place.  This book, instead, permitted Fogg to craft for himself a self-styled persona of "networking expert," with his finger on the pulse beat of the industry.  What Dexter Yager did with Amway, Fogg tried to do with the industry as a whole.  Take a look at his greatestnetwork community.  (Yager, to his credit however, actually built a downline.  I don't think Fogg can say the same.)  The Emperor has no clothes.  There is little, if anything, in this book which is new or thought provoking.  It gives the appearance of substance, but appearances are deceiving 
 Pearl Jam seem to be making a comeback witht their live performances at present, but this DVD shows the band at a less than impressive peak. They all look like they're pretty bored (especially compared with their previous shows) and have eaten to much throughout the tour before going on stage.  A good DVD to avoid 
 "Philosophers often behave like little children who scribble some marks on a piece of paper at random and then ask the grown-up, 'What's that?'" - Ludwig Wittgenstein  Imagine spending an hour and a half with a teenage version of The Sphynx from "Mystery Men," but without Mr. Furious as a foil. Instead, there's the somewhat compassionate, somewhat opportunistic Pearl Madison, played by Don Cheadle. Sometimes I wasn't sure if Cheadle was doing a really good job playing someone who is conflicted, or if his regret for signing up for this film was bleeding through on screen.  The film is similar to "Mystery Men" in a way, though; the filmmakers assembled a talented production crew, and a cast of some of my favorite actors (including Kevin Spacey -- also one of the film's prodcuers) and put them in one of the most frustrating films I've ever sat through.  I guess I'm just really tired of small movies about suburban life with fey, disembodied narrators spouting out random aphorisms and non sequitors. I wouldn't mind so much if the film was able to deliver some sort of epiphany, but it doesn't. When the credits rolled, the only thing I was thinking about was a guy who'd stabbed his girlfriend's retarded brother, and writer/director Matthew Hoge asking, "What's that?" I may as well have watched "Elephant" again.  If exploring suburban angst is your thing, you might like this film. There are better cooked stories out there, though. I watched Larry Clark's "Ken Park" afterward, which was like "The United States of Leland" in a less wealthy neighborhood. Both films were depressing, but I felt so gross after I watched "Ken Park" I promptly returned it to the video store, showered and cleaned my whole apartment. At least I was shocked into action. "The United States of Leland" just had me crawling back into bed.  The soundtrack is okay. The score is by Sunny Day Real Estate's Jeremy Enigk. Jena Malone shoots up heroin to the Pixies, and there's a Dot Allison song I like in the credits that I'd forgotten about. No CD was released. 
 This film is beautifully acted by Kevin Spacey, but far too dark and gloomy for comfortable viewing.  It may indeed depict what the writer thought of the film world, but why inflict this depiction on the world I ask.  The story is cynical, cruel and I found the last half of the film very uncomfortable to watch.  Not a favourite 
 This book is a horrible book.  It is way too abstract and doesn't explain anything in detail.  I had to order a different book just to help me understand the concepts.  
 I happen to think that this book is excellent and the Dave Eggers has a wonderful style. My bad rating of this book is due to the poor condition I received it in ...What a shame 
 After weeks of delaying my shipment I was told Amazon could not get the book for me .. 
 I can't imagine anyone wanting to write a book about this man.He was nothing but a vulgar,lazy,lying alcoholic.Half of the things that he says are nothing but B.S.For instance,Chicago police officers murdering suspected gangsters @ black men for 200$ a pop.I could go on @ on but you should get the idea.Save your money.As for me, I am going to line my cats litter box with my copy 
 These books feature a borderline infantile, whiny, nasty child. When I read Junie B. Jones to my child I felt the need to leave out many of the words and sentiments such as the frequent "I hate" and "stupid." I will be relieved after I donate these books to the public library. Placing them into the recycle bin is a strong temptation 
 Danielle Steel used to be one of my favorite authors. However, Wanderlust was the last book of hers that I really liked. I bought The House hoping maybe she had found her "style" again, but alas it was not to be. I do not understand how a bestselling author can get away with combining points-of-view within one paragraph, "telling" not "showing" the story, and repeating the same things over and over and over until I just want to scream! It seems that perhaps because she is such a big name, her work is not copyread anymore. I think it might be time for her to put away her pen, or get back to the basics of good writing. I will not be buying another of her books anytime soon. I chose to rate this book with one star, because no stars wasn't a choice 
 I mean no disrespect for the FATHER OF POLYMER CHEMISTRY, but its really hard to follow this book especially the equations......they just come out of nowhere.. 
 It's a battery charger; it charges batteries.  It's called 'compact' because the bottom part accordians out to reveal 4 additional slots for batteries.  It feels cheaply made, and doesn't hold the batteries very securely.  Also, you have to charge two batteries at a time (or sets of 2), and they are inserted in opposite directions.  So, if you're charging 4 batteries in 2 sets of two, they would be + - + -.  I realize that's how most devices are set up when you insert the batteries, but I shouldn't have to worry about that when inserting into a charger, especially since (according most warning labels on batteries) inserting it in the charger backwards may cause an explosion resulting in injury or death.  That's a lot of pressure for someone who just wants more juice for his Gameboy.   Ultimately, it does what it says though.  So, if you're looking for a charger to use until you find a real charger, go for it. 
 Unfortunately this is one of those books that I stuggled to get to the end of.  I can just picture Isadora receiving notice that they were going to Cuba and thinking to herself "great! I can write a book and try and profit from it".  My discomfort started when she kept referring to people as an X-----ian, there seemed to be no apparent reason or explanation for this paranoia and it continued throughout the entire book.  By the end of it my cheeks burned with annoyance.  I can only imagine the extent of the damage that she has caused the Cuban tourist industry.  The book seems to be paragraph after paragraph of how appalling things are in Cuba and how little people have.  Again, what was her reasoning for detailing all of this?  And all with apparently such little gusto.  On the whole though, the book is rather dull, switching from one minor detail or rather dull occurrence, to another.  For example, taking the cat to the VET, or the daughter to dance classes.    One aspect of the book does deserve a mention for it's talent.  The ability to write about a dinner with Fidel Castro with such little detail or interest.   I'm a bit worried that Isadora will move somewhere else and write another book about middle class life abroad with her husband 
 For me, the utility of a chemistry text is defined in simple terms. Does it help me complete the homework assignments? Does it explain things in a way that my professor does not? Does it stand alone, apart from the instruction of my professor?  I took an Inorganic course to fill a deficiency and so I bought this book. I found it to be very disappointing. The explanations of key concepts (such as term symbols and crystal field theory) is lacking and the problems that the text works out seem esoteric and too terse for someone trying to connect the dots.  I like the Tarr and Mieslier text better 
 I teach an accelerated college prep US History class in a high school.  Our department selected this book before I arrived at the school in what I've gathered was a flurry of political correctness hysteria to "The American Pageant's" emphasis on white men.  Even if Murrin's book makes an effort to be more PC (sometimes to a fault) it makes the much bigger mistake of assuming that readers already have a fairly sophisticated background in American History.  I think it's interesting reading, but then again, I have a degree in history, so trying to learn how the concept of 18th century mercantilism is connected to the 19th century concept of progress all on the same page isn't really a major feat of mental gymnastics.  Most teachers in my department don't even use the book because it's too confusing for the kids.  If I could have my way, we'd just sell them all and buy something that's (gulp) a little simpler.  To its credit, the book has a nice website with lots of maps and images and resources - but in my memory as a high school student (which was during the age of the internet), a clear, concise textbook was a foundation of learning and more important than a nice website.  This textbook is no learning tool. 
 I feel that it is my duty to inform you that many of the "recipes" in The Anarchist Cookbook are misleading, incorrect, and potentially lethal.  For example, the procedure in the book for making nitroglycerin is incorrect.  If the book's steps are followed, one will end up with nitrotriodite, which is extremely volatile and can explode at the touch of a finger.  William Powell was nothing more than an angry, misinformed hippie.  If you're looking for a more viable source of information about explosive, take some chemistry courses.  The only thing you're going to blow up with this book is yourself 
 Now, before you say anything, I have played this game and beaten it in the week provided by blockbuster(grudgingly playing it though)and now for the unbaiased opinion. I think that this game is so completely stupid. It and the sequel are retarded but again its my opinion. 
 This book provides ideas that could help you sell more effectively, particularly if you are just beginning in sales. If you've read a lot of sales or management books, though, you will already be familiar with many of the ideas it presents.  In my opinion, the book title is misleading. This book reads like it was originally named Fourteen Laws for Better Sales before the publisher decided to boost sales by renaming it. The author seems to feel that if he sprinkles the words "high trust" throughout the text, then that's what the book is about. It's really not.  In High Trust Selling, Todd Duncan offers standard advice on selling dressed up in "high trust" clothes. But he does not really place the sales cycle in the context of the principles we advocate in the TrustBuild Program. If you need an introduction to selling or a review of basic principles, you might want to buy this book. Otherwise, there are better choices.  Robert Reed President TrustBuild 
 The concept of this book was great! Unfortunately the delivery left a lot to be desired. I actually had to force myself to finish the last third of it. All of the magical elements were left exceptionally vague, just a lot of mist and nausea. Now "the Grey" ,a spririt world between worlds, may be a confusing place but it is the authors duty to explain and visually describe in order to pull the reader in, make us understand. The Grey just sounded like a foggy night with a bad burrito in your belly.  The lack of description just continued over into the characters, none of which you'll be pining for at the end. The main character never gave a reason why you should really be rooting for her and care what happens to her personnally.Plus I was just past the middle of the book and thinking, when is the actual plot going to start.  Sorry this wasn't a book for me and I'll pretty much read anything in the fantasy/romance genre 
 They sent me wrong lens cover and said I ordered the wrong one..........don't think so since I got copy.......poor customer service all around..... 
 An amazing transformation came over me while reading this book. No, I did not turn into a lizard or a bird. Never before have I experienced such an enormous swing in my state of mind while reading a book. No classic has moved me so much. No works of Hume, nor Kant, nor even Harry Potter's chambermaid have driven in me such a force of wild-eyed realization as compared with this amazing collection of words. I will do my best to describe the story, without boxing your ears or tugging my braid.  The story starts like all of Jordan's stories do, which is to say that an avalanche of words were used to describe such mundane things as grass and horse eye lashes. Nevertheless, Jordan's indispensable and uncanny knack for stringing words together kept me in the game. I had read the first seven books in the series and knew what I was up against. This was nothing. A hundred, two hundred, or even fifty thousand words to describe yet another immature dialog between a pair of immature people wedged in an altogether immature scenario would never get me down.  But as time wore on, it started to wear on me. Like water over a rock, my meddle started to wan, slowly washing away with the sands of the wheel of time. I began zoning out, unable to focus on the words on the page before me, finding myself having read an entire paragraph with no recollection of having done so. I wondered, am I really taking an SAT test? All my previous training seemed to have left me. My eyes were failing me, my brain quitting. I was aghast. This series of books that had heretofore been as straight in it's narrative as a pentangle was bogging down more than I thought even possible. I was losing interest. The flame was going out.  But I dug deep. I concentrated on the void, the endless void, the taint of Boredom making the void sickly sweet and palpable in my veins. I could taste it, it's sickening blackened bleary broken bleakness trying to take over my mind, my body, my soul. I controlled it. And with that control, Jordan's world of Boredom coursed through my veins like a pat of hot butter on a toasted English muffin on a hot summer day in Florida when the air conditioner is broken.  Shortly I had discovered the long lost Talent of Skimming. What had previously taken hours to read now took minutes! Pages down in seconds, chapters in no time at all. Boredom? Shredded to bits. Single words picked here and there, dialog grasped in an instant when the words "boxed" or "grasped" sprung from the page. I was alive, I was being tainted by Boredom! The lost Talent of Skimming, an astoundingly rare yet miraculously rediscovered Talent much like others I came across while reading this book, made me feel more alive than ever. Not to be outdone, Skimming was joined by Sleeping, Ignoring, Laughing, Putting Down, and Reading Something Else. All amazing powers in their own right, but nothing to hold a candle to Skimming.  In no time, Jordan's 8th book came to a close, and the narrative was no closer to being resolved than if all the characters had jumped into a blender and pressed the puree button, using the One Power of course. I mean, how else would they press the puree button if they were *in* the blender? I dare say that it would be improbable.  In any event, this book was so bad that the time invested in all 8 can't keep me coming back for a 9th. Fool me 8 times, shame on you. Fool me 9, shame on me 
 The pleasure of Plato is as much from his literary as from his philosophical acumen. The choice of the public-domain Jowett translation is unhappy for bringing out the literary merit of the original. This Victorian prose, while usually competent as translation, does not ring true to the original and certainly does nothing for the late 20th century American ear. One wonders why the set is so expensive when the translation was had for nothing. And why doesn't Amazon print the contents of these cassettes in their bibliographical information. Does one have to buy the set to find out exactly what its contents are&gt 
 I was very disappointed to find that most of chapter 5 "Genetic Engineering" was incomplete. The chapter was cut off (on page 80) and was followed by a repetition of page 49-80. Chapter 6 "Why we should Worry" had been left out and the beginning of chapter 7 "Human Rights" (page 105-113) was missing as well. It was very important for me to work on precisely these (missing) chapters at exactly this moment in time, so I am of course quite dissatisfied with the quality of this particular product.  
 After reading other reviews, I ordered this book. I've worked with SQL Server since version 4.2 and just wanted a resource for new features. I was very disappointed. I found very little of use.   Integration Services is new and I looked forward to the chapter on the topic. There is nothing in the book to explain the design or graphical use of SSIS. Everything is programatic. I followed it through the chapter. It was difficult to follow and to set up. When I got to the end of the chapter, it said data flow (a common use of SSIS) was beyond the scope of the chapter and referred the reader to Books Online.  My experience is that you might as well use Books Online as this book. I own many technical books. This one I sent back 
 Let's set aside the fact that Robert Coles knows little or nothing about what makes Bruce Springsteen an artist worthy of close study. To Coles, Springsteen is an abstraction, some hazy creature who fits into Coles' ideas about "documentary art." Coles has nothing to teach people about Springsteen because from his writing here it's clear he doesn't have a clue.  Dr. Coles has written well over 50 books in his career of 40-plus years. And probably two or three of them are actually quite good and readable. THE CALL OF STORIES is a great book. The CHILDREN OF CRISIS READER is very good, although its "documentary" tales are a little too neatly packaged and tied up to be considered totally accurate.   Coles is considered somewhat of a "guru" for Documentary Work in this country. To a growing number of critics, this is an ironic distinction given that in many of his books he may be using composites of various real people. Or he may be embellishing real events and conversations to suit his needs. Less "Truth" and more "Truthiness" as comedian Stephen Colbert might put it.   Reviewers who complain about his writing style have valid criticisms. I'd describe the writing as stream-of-consciousness meets psychoanalytic note-taking with a healthy sprinkling of colloquialisms from old Mickey Rooney movies. And it's true - the man refuses to use "periods" as tools of punctuation. His sentences run on and on with clauses pasted together by commas, semi-colons, dashes, you name it. At Harvard University where he used to teach, faculty and students nicknamed him Robert "No Word Goes Unpublished" Coles!!!  As for the veracity of this "oral history" study??...Critics have hinted that after the success of CHILDREN OF CRISIS in the late 1960s and early 1970s, he found it easier and easier to just fabricate his sources. He has a bad habit of making the quotations of his subjects sound too much like his own voice. And it seems that he always has at his fingertips just the PERFECT quote coming from the many famous observers he has known (ranging from Dorothy Day to Walker Percy to Paul Tillich to Robert F. Kennedy). You would think Coles must have discussed every subject under the sun with these people to have such a catalogue of quoted remarks.  The Springsteen book is no exception when it comes to the typical flaws in Coles' work, only more so. He quotes dozens of "hard working citizens" (a condescending term coming from a Harvard psychiatrist) saying things that sound just like Coles/Mickey Rooney (and yet lack insight into Springsteen).  An article in The New Republic magazine at the time of this book's publication formally labels the charge of fabrication at Coles. A review in The Vilage Voice called this the "worst book ever written about Bruce Springsteen."  In short, I think that some of the stuff in this book is mostly made up to suit whatever point Coles is making on the page. I have no axe to grind with the author - I Just think the evidence is there (if you look for it) to support fabrication and sloppiness.   Dr. Coles has at some point decided that he has all the answers. The voices in his tales are simply characters set up to make a point that Coles himself has worked out in his mind. Somewhere along the way, the documentarian became lazy or self-satisfied, or both. When it comes to Springsteen, Robert Coles is just dancing in the dark 
 In my humble opinion, there are only 2 truly great recordings of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in D Major - Haifetz with the Chicago Symphony and Kung-Wa Chung's. These are the only peformers who capture for me the gypsy spirit of this magnificent piece. The CD mastering of the Heifetz version in this recording is terrible. Even on a good system, it is screechy and irritating. I have a Time-Life LP recording of this performance which is much better, crackles and all. Lovers of this masterwork who like to hear it played with a full range of emotion would be better advised to get the Kung-Wa Chung version which has been recorded with more up-to-date technology. This CD does no service to the great Heifetz 
 I read almost the entire book, only to find out that there wasn't an ending??  I couldn't wait to find out if Teresa was convicted, and what her sentence was, only to find out that the author ended the book before that could be determined.  Was the author so desperate for a pay out that she couldn't wait alittle longer to give her book the proper ending??  I am beyond disappointed.  Infact I am disgusted!!  
 Educational advice from an unrepentant Weatherman/bomber of the '60s.  Not worth the trees destroyed to print it.  Avoid unless you are a rabid socialist 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 I concur with my fellow reviewers that this Casebook contains more typos and grammaticla errors than a first-grader's book-report!!  If your Torts prof is excellent (and mine was) such editorial problems won't keep you from getting a good grade.  But, to be sure, buy the Examples and Explanations by Glannon and a good commercial outline to supplement this POOR casebook!  Finally, I wholeheartedly agree with one of the reviewers who indicated that this casebook is VERY much biased towards the plaintiff's bar and against defendents, businesses, or "the MAN" 
 I was disappointed with this book. He has his picture on every other page, literally. The numbering of chapters is confusing. I truely have gotten much more out of "Strong Women Stay Slim" by Miriam Nelson, which I got from the library, and now have purchased. I would suggest taking a look at Jorge's somewhere before making your purchase~ (do as I say, not as I do LOL) "Strong Women" just seemed so much simpler, and the drawings of the exercises are pleasant and clear. Often times I don't want to do the exercises, then I think "well, I'll just do the first one" and before I know it I've done them all and am feeling better. In fact, I have now ordered Nelson's book on arthritis. Note: There are only 6 basic exercises plus stretching in Nelson's work, so it certainly doesn't take much longer than Jorge's "8 Minutes. 
 It's about time someone stands up and says : "red scare is all about mean politicans and innocents writers", "soviet spies never existed". That movie is telling us just that, by completely ignoring the spionage problem and the Corea war. One thing is particularly shocking, let's think of the millions of the victims of the Gulag when we see Stalin's poster in Streisand's room. "Freedom of speech will never exist in this country", says Redford-Pollack ; i just wish you were born in USSR, you criminal. 
 I just finished it and my first thought was "What an awful, awful book." I was really excited about reading this one too because the back jacket held such great promise. (i.e. "haunting world of avarice, skullduggery, and exceptional evil." Oh really?? I guess I missed that.) Seems more like an ordinary, even dull, murder story. The main narrator even has to mention that there is exceptional evil afoot. Should he really have to point that out?   As others have mentioned the plot is very convoluted with numerous side stories and people that after the fact seem to contribute nothing to the main story. How many times do I have to read a narrative on King Alfred? At one point yet another person wants to tell Alfred's story and the narrator says he doesn't need to hear it again. My only thought was "Oh thank god!" (I'm still not clear on what this story had to do with the mystery.)   I still don't understand how some of the characters were connected to the murder and what their motivations were. Also, the mystery was wrapped up too nicely w/the Indian boys narration at the end. He basically spelled out exactly what happened. But shouldn't that have been done throughout the book instead of dumping it at the end? (It's like the author got bored and didn't feel like writing anymore. But I don't think we can fault him for that after all the filler he wove into the story that contributed absolutely nothing to the mystery.)   I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I don't think it is particularly brilliant like all of the quotes in the book make it out to be, nor is it well written. 
 As is sometimes the case, the title of this book is somewhat misleading.  Having read several books which were generally favorable to Greenspan I thought this one might give a balance counter view.  Overall, it turned out to quite a disappointment.  In the first few pages Professor Batra made it clear that he thinks he is probably more qualified to be the Fed Chairman than Greenspan.  On page 1 he says "He had not done any path-breaking work in economics, at least not that was commonly cited."  On page 3 he says "It could explain how he had advanced so far without sufficient credentials; how his extraordinary career appeared to derive crucially not from merit but from favoritism and connections".  Also on page 3 -"Greenspan did not even have a Ph.D. at the time; nor had he penned anything pioneering to earn the recognition of his peers".  On page 7 I again knew the book was in trouble when Batra stated "...because in my view intelligence and integrity go together".  Does anyone actually believe that all dishonest people are dumb?  On page 9 Batra made it clear that the book was as much, or more, about his economic philosophy than it was about Greenspan when he wrote "In fact, I will offer a new economic paradigm to cure the global stagnation that has resulted from tax trade, and monetary policies inspired by Greenspan".  He does offer a paradigm; unfortunately, real world experience shows that the paradigm does not to work as he postulates.  Clearly, the book is attempting to put forth his agenda.  As the rest of the book demonstrates, Professor Batra is a fairly strong liberal in whose world the working poor will spend all additional income and the idle rich will simply put extra income under their mattress.  He regularly harps on reducing income taxes on the "poor" and increasing them on the "rich" and "big businesses".  As recently as 2003, the Congressional Budget Office documented that the bottom 40% to 50% of the population pay little or no taxes while the upper income individuals and businesses pay the vast majority.  How the government could reduce the taxes on people who do not pay taxes is never addressed.  Professor Batra does correctly point out that the Social Security tax is quite regressive.  In order to discredit Greenspan, Batra gives Greenspan gives Greenspan far more power than is warranted.  Throughout the book, Batra tries to convince us that the President and Congress did whatever Greenspan might suggest or support.  As written, the book makes one believe that Batra never watched Greenspan testify before Congress where the congressmen tried to get Greenspan to support their way of thinking.  Basically, Batra tries to blame Greenspan for all of the acts of Congress.  Batra's new paradigm he calls Economic Democracy.  In this Economic Democracy the Federal Government would buy most of the stock of the large companies and then give it, or sell it at a big discount, to the employees of the companies.  That way the employees would be in control rather than the CEOs and boards of directors.  Clearly, Professor Batra is not living in the real world.  In the real world most of the employees who were given the stock would simply sell it in fairly quick order and that, of course, would return things to where they originally were.  For many years I was an "employee owner" of the nations largest totally employee owned company and I can attest that they do not operate in any way close to what Professor Batra assumes.  The good professor needs to get out his ivory tower and get a job in the real world.  If you want to learn about Greenspan, this is NOT the book to read.  Save your money. 
                   [Sadly, many readers base their votes as to                how helpful a review is, on whether it agrees                with their own views. Few non-conservatives                would even bother reading reviews of a book                like this!]    If you are a dyed-in-the-wool conservative merely looking for a feel-good experience in the form of an endless diatribe against liberals, this book is for you. Read no further. Buy the book.  If, however, you are interested in solving the social problems that face our country today, and want to learn about the various merits and pitfalls of programs and suggestions for solving those problems, then you should forget this book and go in search of an author who cares at least as much about solving the problems as she does about dumping on liberals--because that's all you'll get here.   Anybody can blather endlessly on what's broken; but to impress me, you have to suggest a better way--or at least give me the impression you actually care about resolving the problems in the first place. The problems historical to our welfare system, for example, are no secret to anyone. But hats off to those who care enough to keep trying to get it right. For her obvious lack of empathy, I can only assume MacDonald is among those many conservatives who, having gotten theirs, see no need for any form of welfare whatsoever, under any circumstance, and simply want it to disappear altogether. Such people say they would gladly help anyone "truly" in need--it's just that they can't imagine anyone ever actually being "truly" in need, because, to them, anyone in need is simply lazy.  I am light years from being a left wing extremist, and I am absolutely FOR welfare reform, but I certainly know better than to cite examples of thirteen-year-old children to illustrate how people should be left to suffer the consequences of their irresponsible behaviors. What heartless fundamentalism! If you cannot understand how not having a decent parent can foster "irresponsible" behavior in a child--a child!, and demand that that child basically be left abandoned to her deserved punishment, then you have nothing meaningful to say. If your tough love isn't based on love, it is worthless.  One of the 13-year-old children MacDonald discusses is a girl who was pregnant due to rape (not due to personal irresponsibility). Her siblings and parents were living horror stories of drugs and violence. Social workers sought to place the girl with other relatives, where she would have a more suitable environment for success. Instead of lauding those efforts, MacDonald's gripe about this case is that no one forced the girl to give up her baby. That there was no irresponsible behavior on the girl's part mattered not to MacDonald. The young woman should be made to suffer--for the rapist's irresponsibility, I guess.   MacDonald takes every opportunity to depict the poor (and of course these would be the "undeserving" poor, since that is all she concerns herself with) in the worst possible light--anything to make any form of welfare look silly. If you are bright enough to understand that welfare is intended for the truly needy, not the "undeserving," and wonder how MacDonald would address the needs of a responsible person who is truly in need through some unfortunate circumstance beyond the person's control, don't hold your breath. She doesn't even acknowledge a need, and the last thing she would do in this book is to cite an example that might support even a conservative program to help the poor.  The author cites projects that were clearly experimental, titled as such and referred to by MacDonald herself as experimental. Yet she then goes on at length to announce, as if bringing some great revelation to our attention, what failures they were. You'd think somebody was trying to incorporate them into routine policy! If nobody, or only a handful of extremists that no one is listening to, is arguing for something, why the pompous declarations? Answer: the point is to ridicule liberals, not find solutions.  I heard this book in audio format, while traveling, and every few sentences, I could only blurt out, "But...!" because of the lapses of logic or, more frequently, important parts of the discussion totally ignored. What about the "deserving" needy? Or the "undeserving" needy who are, nevertheless, needy? Do we just let them starve? (MacDonald would not permit begging.) Maybe letting them starve is an argument of merit, but MacDonald only tells us how broken things are, she doesn't address solutions nor even outline what she sees as the problems--if any.  She spends a chapter scoffing at the notion that homeless people would like to be housed. A study showed that many of them did not. Okay, that is a good thing to know, and it will inform our homeless policies. But again, don't hold your breath for MacDonald to discuss those who *do* need and want housing. Go to work for any homeless shelter (according to a friend who worked for several) and you will find cases of bright, formerly well-employed people who lost everything (often due to illness of a spouse). What about them? It is a non-issue with MacDonald, who finds it easier, and perhaps more fun, to scoff at those who care and try and make mistakes and try again. Nor does she address the endlessly botched (and largely conservative-based) healthcare policy in the U.S. and how it might directly relate to homelessness.  Some of her strongest ridicule is reserved for anyone who would think self-esteem is important enough to pay any attention to, when we develop school policy. Again, anyone can cite the most absurdly extreme examples of experimental efforts. But isn't it equally absurd to suggest the choice has to be all or nothing? Hey, if *I* didn't need anyone to help foster self esteem in me, then why should some 9-year-old black kid who didn't have a father and who's mother was a junkie need it? I got *my* caring parents, you get yours!  When MacDonald talks about the horrors of our museums trying to make their displays more diverse and inclusive, it frankly sounds like sour grapes. I mean, curators got a clue and started fixing things... damn! Even if (big IF) some museums have overcompensated in their laudable efforts toward balanced and inclusive presentations, she can't bring herself even to hint that perhaps indeed there was a problem to start with. Her attitude is like that of whites who complain that we don't have a "White Awareness Month." (In fact, in one of her examples, she complains that if a white student had written the same kind of essay that a black student had written, there would be outrage. Is that the extent of her rational insight and maturity?) If museums have erred on the side of too much diversity, after a couple of hundred years of erring on the side of too little, how bothered can a sane person get? Tweak the solution and move on! At this point it actually crossed my mind that MacDonald could be an "angry straight white man" using a pseudonym! We white males had it so good for so many years, and now that the scales tip a little closer to balance--or, God forbid, half an ounce too far--the sky is falling!   One need not wonder whether MacDonald ever got as bent out of shape over too LITTLE diversity and minority representation as she does over her irrational fear that such issues might now be slightly overstated rather than grossly understated.  There is no question that caring can go too far, or, better put, that many things that have been tried haven't worked or need tweaking. No one disputes it. But what is the point of announcing, almost with apparent glee, that something didn't work? A meaningful, worthwhile work would discuss the problems themselves and attempt to make another inch-worth of progress toward resolving them. To imply that the old ways were just fine doesn't cut it for me.  I have a longstanding commitment to hearing all sides, and that's why I endured this marathon rant. It was largely a waste of time, because I already knew what was wrong. The only reason the book rates a star is that you do learn some history, some details about the things that were wrong--which can be interesting for the learning, if not for a solution. The only reason for an undeserved second star is to keep from looking like an extremist that people won't bother to read. Other reviewers who gave this book only one or two stars are right on the mark. They say it better than I. Take a look at them.  As for the audio version, the reader drones about as much as one possibly could. The only excitement or change in tone seems to be in direct quotes when she livens up to make a minority person sound as dumb as she can, or to make an opposing view sound as silly as possible. Count on a lot of coffee if you want to stay on the road with this one. 
 A book about bebop drummers needs to explain 1) what bebop drumming consists of and 2) how the styles of the various drummers profiled diverge. This book does not do either. Instead we are told that drummer after drummer after drummer has "a great feel" and "great time"; we learn nothing.  If it were just that I'd give the book another star for its sketchy and scattered biographical information, but considering how badly written the book is, I can't justify it.  I suggest instead that you buy a copy of "The Grove Dictionary of Jazz" and look up the entry for each famous drummer you want to know about. You'll learn a lot more and have a much better time doing it.  For transcriptions consult Modern Drummer magazine.   
 If you're looking for a book to convince you or remind you that the left is evil/pathetic/wrong/or whatever look elsewhere.  Flynn does a poor job of fact finding or arguing his point.  He relies on, for example, what are apparently random people he interviewed at protests to create a blanket view of liberal beliefs.  Look at the footnotes in Chapter 4.  I'm sorry but this is like looking for a Leno's Jaywalking segment to find spokespeople for a movement.  Also in Chapter 4, Flynn lays out the 5 myths of the left.  Does the left actually believe them?  As a bleeding heart liberal who knows mostly other bleeding heart liberals I'll give my response:  1)	American Women Live Under a Patriarchy - his point is that women in America are better off than just about anywhere else.  True, but that doesn't mean they don't live under a patriarchy. 2)	America is the World's Leading Threat to the Environment - his point is that places like Russia and China are far worse.  No one I know disagrees with his point.  3)	America is a Racist Nation - His point is that we are not.  I don't know any liberals who think America is a Racist nation 4)	The United States is an Imperial Power - as this was published in 2002 I'll abstain from commenting other than to say that he says the left believes that the international growth of Starbucks, McDonalds and such is cultural imperialism.  I think many liberals would agree with that.  He says most of the countries embrace these companies opening stores in them.  I say that doesn't mean its not cultural imperialism. 5)	The Rich Get Richer, the Poor Get Poorer.  His argument is apparently that individuals who were in the lowest 20% of the income bracket in 1979 were mostly not in 1988.  He cites and article in the National Review where these numbers came from.  That article sites a Treasury Department survey.  So he's relying on secondary sources for his information?  Looks like shoddy research to me.    The book is riddled with problems.  For example, On pg. 31 he quotes Robert Altman as saying that we were in a way for Afghani oil interests.  Flynn then says that its not clear who Altman was referring to or why he would say that about a country without major oil reserves.  Here Flynn misses a perfect opportunity to attack a widely held liberal belief that Bush attacked Afghanistan for a potential pipeline that could be used to get oil out of Central Asian countries.  He doesn't though.  He lets it lie.  This is the nature of my problem with him.  Again and again his attacks are inept or simply untrue.    Reading his summary of why the Left hates America is just tripe.  No one I know thinks like this.  He says we believe capitalism is a failed economic system.  I don't know anyone who believes this.  Personally, I believe in universal healthcare but that's primarily because I've dealt with HMO's before.  He also says the Left condemn Christianity as intolerant.  Once again, no one I know believes this.  This book is full on nonsense.   
 After all the hype about the Polk XRt12 I was expecting the sound quality from this unit to be nothing short of astonishing. I'm sorry to say that I'm disappointed. While it was a breeze to hook up via optical cable to my Harman/Kardon AVR110 and it was simple to aim the antenna (according to the "antenna aiming signal strength indicator" I had a perfect signal) it has the same quality as my Delphi SkyFi unit that it replaces. I can't hear any difference between the two. Even with side by side comparison (Polk XRt12 vs. Delphi Skyfi) they sound the same. I wouldn't recommend buying this to replace any exisiting home unit. If you already have XM at home, the signal sounds just as good with what you already have. With all the compression involved in beaming the XM signals to earth, there's only so much any device can extract. You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear 
 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes 
 I find it interesting that in the pages I scanned through that I couldn't find a single fact. All I found was the fallacy of "Argumentum ad Hominum" (Argument against the Man i.e. "He's a schmuck therefore anything he says or does isn't valid") Now, granted, I didn't (couldn't) read the whole book so I don't know if she got into any actual facts that could be looked up and verified but just the fact that what I did read was so obviously skewed by emotion doesn't lend any credence with me of the facts. I am NOT a Republican but I do like my information to be clear, concise and to have the ability to be verified. I do not appreciate "scare" tactics or emotional string pulling. Let me decide what my emotions should be by giving me the FACTS 
 The can has to be 100% dent free for this to work.  If you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can, this thing won't open your product.  A great idea, but this needed a little more refinement.  Paper weight in my min 
 Miss Congeniality 2- Armed and Fabulous is a terrible, unoriginal little sequel. No wonder it didn't make a lot at the box office, I love Bullock, she is one of my favorite movie stars but this film was just hideous. The only reason I didn't give this movie one star is because the scene with the Dolly Parton was hilarious, practically the only funny scene in the sequel. And what's so great about Regina King? She doesn't seem like a break-out star to me, she's nothing to rave about. Avoid this movie, you will be happy you did 
 This is my first Nick Hornby read and I was very tempted to make it my last.  I had a really hard time getting through it.  I usually read a book straight through in 2-3 days and can't wait to read them at any free moment.  But, I had to force myself to get through this one.  The book didn't flow very well and seemed to skip all over the place.    Seeing negative reviews from people who have read his other books has helped me decide to give Hornby another chance.    I wouldn't recommend this book 
 "American Buffalo" was recommended to me by a fellow thespian because he thought this was raw and fantastic.  It is indeed raw, but not at all fantastic.  The dialogue is very choppy and I felt out of the loop with it - as if I missed some great detail.  Perhaps this is a play that needs to be enjoyed when seen performed, rather than just read. I do not recommend 
 THE ROLLING STONES SUCK! THEY ONLY MADE 2 DECENT ALBUMS IN SOME GIRLS AND TATTOO YOU. DIRE STRAITS, METALLICA, AND FOREIGNER ARE A BILLION TIMES BETTER! I CAN'T BELIVE SO MANY PEOPLE REVIEWED THIS AWFUL ALBUM AS IT SUCKS. THEY ARE JUST AS BAD AS GREEN DAY, PINK FLOYD, THE BEATLES, AC/DC, AND LED ZEPPELIN. AVOID THIS ALBUM AND GET MASTER OF PUPPETS FROM METALLICA INSTED 
 Being authoritative enough to convince people in the writing business is essential and Drosnin does that and he has "experts" to back him up, but why do we need a code anyway?  A little bit of research and you'll find that all these ideas about the future are already out there. There is no doubt the world is going to hell in a hand-basket.   Mankind has always been on the brink of war or at war, continuously.  Nothing new and few will be surprised if we blow each other up.    Books like these are just another way to generate an income for both writer and publisher while the going is good - they can't lose if wrong because the money's already been made and author's always can leave themselves a back door, in this case something like a catch-22 phrase inferring more than one possible future, etc., etc. to cover themselves.  Ultimately this books sells fear.  This is a market rich in opportunities these days.  We need more books on practical solutions to the human problem.  The book is sensationalism trying to be serious. If one considers themselves a genuine Christian, this subject is useless to waste time over.  
 This DVD gets only 2 stars because the 4:3 TV screen format of this DVD production is really ridiculous.  But the movie is one of my favorites, number 4 on my all time best movies list. The feel of the movie is more like that of a typical 70's sci fi movie (like 'Andromeda') than of a 60's movie. Austere and unemotional (like Colossus himself), quietly and punctuously narrated, minimalistically acted and with minimal action - a movie for the brain, as befits a movie about a giant electronic brain taking over control of the world. I like the outdated look of the technology in the movie - black-and-green screens, LED displays, printout terminals etc. Really gets you the feel of the dawn of the computer age in the 60's. And captures- then reasonable-appearing - fears of computers surpassing human beings. ATTENTION! SPOILER! The movie has no happy end, the supercomputer maintains control of the earth in the end. Just as it is in D.F. Jones' novel 'Colossus' on which the movie is based. And that's another reason why I like the movie so much - one of the few movies WITHOUT a forseeable and boring happy ending. The absence of a happy ending is not the absence of an ending, by the way, contrary to what has been supposed by a previous reviewer.  This movie almost has the quality of a Kubrick 
 About all I hear about Clancy is that he is a very good writer, one of the best in military fiction, etc. but this book is pathetic. I started reading this book (my first by Clancy) expecting it to be a great read. Not so at all. You could almost summarize the whole book with: "A U.S. submarine goes out and shoots dozens of Chinese vessels without damage to itself." which is stupid. This book portrays Chinese submarines as total piles of junk. They may not be near as good as U.S. submarines, but that doesn't mean that they are total junk. Not far into the book, it became very repetitious and boring: the U.S. submarine shoots some Chinese, goes to a submarine tender and reloads, goes out and shoots more Chinese, comes back and reloads, goes out.... etc. which is not good writing. Not only that, but the submarine captain always thinks of just the right way to attack and just happens to have the right weapons for the job. BORING. Also, the main submarine is constantly in battle and has only one minor problem. Yet two other submarines come in to help and are almost immediately damaged severely. Another submarine comes to help in the final mission and is sunk shortly into the mission. Give me a break. Also, every once in a while Clancy gets off on a topic that is barely related to the book. For example: once he takes a few pages to tell about the process of how submariners become qualified for certain jobs. I really do not care who tests them or for how long. Another annoying quality is that he is constantly putting in the abbrieviations of some weapon or something like that and then putting in the full words. He even goes as far as to put "....CIA (Central Intelligence Agency)....". Give me a break. I would not recommend this book. If you want good military fiction, try Tin Soldiers by Michael Farmer. It does have a small American force beating a much larger force, but the Americans at least take heavy losses. No total American invinciblity in that book 
 After reading the glorious reviews by other customers, I was very excited to receive this book. I was so disappointed by the dull colors and simplicity of the cutouts. I was expecting some text with the pop-outs not just one word descriptions. I returned this book the same day I got it 
 There seems to be some useful information in this book. However, the total lack of proofreading makes me question its accuracy 
 My daughter is two years old and this book helped me normalize my child's behavior. My daughter is my only child so i had nothing to compare her sleeping patterns. However, after reading this book, i understand that i am doing the right thing and that she is a unique and special child. I related to several of the stories in the book and it helped me be more patient and understanding of my daughter. Thanks Dr. Jodi MIndell for writing this book.  
 When I read stuff on the back of this novel like, "preposterously brilliant", "a classic comic novel", and "Amis was a genuine comic writer, perhaps the best", I immediately snatched this book up and started rummaging through the sentences, paragraphs, and chapters with heightened interest. The book was interesting enough for me to buy it from Borders bookstore 30 minutes after reading a bit. Even though I didn't laugh, I believed I just had to read it from beginning to end. So I took this book home expecting something hilarious; the result: a genuine cure for insomnia. I don't care for all these praises of "masterpiece" or "this book explores the complexities of human condition and human relations". I want an interesting read; I'm not calling for an action-packed Ian Fleming, James Bond novel, I'm asking for something engrossing. I didn't get what I asked for.  The visually descriptive details in this novel are thoroughly lacking. Amis doesn't bother to write about the setting, the atmosphere, the people (except for Bertrand, Christine, and Margaret to some degree); as a result I have no idea what Welch, Dixon, Beesley, etc. look like. They all could be wearing bedsheets all the time for all I know.   All in all, this novel is not recommended: it lacks physical detail and humor.   P.S. If you search all the previous good recommendations you'll see the high reviews were simply given by "a reader"; probably the same dude 
 My daughter eyed this in the store for weeks and I surprised her with it for her birthday. We followed all of the instructions and, like the other reviewers, nothing happened. The seeds do no germinate. Even one star is far too generous for this product 
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 I bought this biography because I have always been fascinated with Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in her husband's administration.  I was hoping for an objective look at her contributions to policy, instead, this novel is full of acrimonious allegations and innuendo.  It seems that the author is completely unable to separate HRC the person from her politics.  This book is horribly slanted and I would not recommend to someone who truly desires insight into either one of the Clintons 
 Can be easily captured without buying the DVD. Firstly, rip up $13. Then, beat yourself over the head with a hammer until your brains are coming out of your nose. Then, have Dana Carvey spit on you. Finally, shoot yourself in the stomach.  This movie is not funny, entertaining. It does not even have a remotely interesting story. As some of the other reveiwers have said, this movie has the same terrible joke, repeated throughout the whole movie.  Avoid this one like the plague 
 Sorry folks, this is not a serious book by any standards. Much of what Shenkman has to say is either unproved speculation or purposeful misunderstanding of events and indeed of history itself. Please do not take this as a serious effort. It is not 
 This book from Ralph Nader, George Bush's best ally and secret weapon, shows why the great New York Times writer Thomas Friedman has accurately described Nader as a creature of the lunatic fringe of American politics.  Nader's connection to reality is extremely tenous.  He is a latter-day Luddite, and his proposals have no chance of ever being adopted.  This is why he has chosen the role of spoiler.  If he can't be President, he reasons, why should Al Gore?  Better to let a right-wing monster like George W. Bush become President and destroy the country 
 In this book the well known Dr. Ferber tells us that he is a "specialist" in sleep. He doesn't mention that he is a speciallist in CHILD sleep behaviors at Harvard and NOT an infant sleep behaviors. He doesn't mention that he NEVER works with infants at Harvard and that Brazelton is Harvards infant sleep specialist. (yes there are big differences between an infants ability to sleep and an 8 year olds)  In this book Dr. Ferber tells you to let your child "cry it out" with an occasional check on your child to make sure hes ok and let him know you are still around...even though scientific studies have proven infants don't gain a sense of permanance (ie: they think when you leave the room you are gone forever) until around 7 months of age. Bower and Wishart:1972,   Johnson, M. H., & Siegler, R. S.:1997,  harvard study. Brazelton & Als: 1980 and many more have proven this and Brazeltons countinuing INFANT research at Harvard continues to support this.  And FERBER himself NOW suggests the you do NOT ever use the Ferber method unless your child is at least 6 months old... however that is not what it states in his ORIGINAL book as it was written in the 80's (30 years ago) and unless someone is getting this very new, revised edition they will not know this (As well most parents will totoally disregard this anyways) However in this new, updated version (the new version only) he does go a little bit into building a good night time ritual and rocking and singing to your child as well as Before you "Ferberize," you should make sure that feeding habits, pain, stress (like a child who is screaming and crying isn't going to be stressed) or medications are not causing or contributing to your baby's sleep problems.   In this book Ferber as well suggests in this updated book that, not only should you let your child cry it out but that you shouldn't pick them up. And EVEN if your child is hyper-ventilting from being so upset (wouldn't you love your child to pass out because then he'd be quiet), or is throwing up (which can cause dehydration not to mention its painful) not to pick up your child, but just to clean him off "as best as you can" and lay him back down and leave.  It's a parents job to ensure that all your baby's needs are met. What could be more in need then a infant who can do nothing for himeself, cannot even speak, who is screaming out for help and is trowing up all over. I mean what kind of mother would listen to a man when she feels guilt in her heart and sees her child gettign sick. I feel guilty when I lie, I feel guilty when I break a promise, I know when I feel guilty I am doing something WRONG.  And ensuring a childs needs are meat means not just physically but emotionally as well, Ferber never goes into any aspects of the childs emotional health in this book because he knows it is just another form of ignoring another human begin. Does The advice in this book work..yes it will work for almost anyone, I could beat my kid silly to get him to clean his room..it would work but certainly would be a cruel choice.   Do you know toddlers and infants have no sense of time. Its not just when you say "5 minutes honey" and they say "are we there yet" one minute latter, infants have even less sense of any sort of time, and 5 minutes of crying when they are scared, lonely, or confused can seem like an eternity.  When I am sad I like a hug from a friend, when I need help I would hate my husband if he just ignored me when I asked for help. Why should we treat our children different. Because its to much work?   If you just can't put the effort into taking care of your child day AND night like most people then this book is for you, but be sure to get the revised edition, not the 30 year old version 
 I think when many say they knew after 15 minutes who the killer was, they're actually saying they guessed who the killer was and just happened to be right.   Think about this for a moment: What was the motive? That was something I never figured out. The killer didn't have a motive. That's what threw me off. But I guess some would say a crazed killer doesn't need a motive. But come on! Even the deranged killer in 7even had a reason for killing. Even Norman Bates had a reason for killing.  It could be the reason was explained but I just missed it because the movie was so terrible. I don't know. I really don't want to have to watch the whole movie again to figure it out.  I know if you have a lot of high profile actors in secondary roles, one of them is the killer for sure; but you're thrown off by the fact that you have Andy Garcia, D.W. Moffett, and Sam L. Jackson. So all 3 are fair game 
 I have been a fan of Star Trek for many years now, and I'd heard about this book.  "The Physics of Star Trek", sounded like a really fun read.  I was interested to know how some of the technology that was invented for the show might be practically applied, or how it could work in the real world.  But the Author goes about destructing the technology and "physics" of star trek and telling us that "it wont work because...".  That might be a better title for this book "Star Trek technology wont work because..."  OK, so we all know that star trek is fiction - It is not real.  If you think its real your in a bit of trouble.  But it is nice to once and a while escape into a world of make believe and fantasy.  This book goes about systematically disproving and destructing the technology and "physics" of star trek, umm ... we know its not real ok?  For example, there is a section on Warp Drive.  The author spends (too much) time setting the scene of a ship in orbit and the captain tells the ensign to set a course and go to warp.  He then goes about explaining that if the ship went to warp everybody would be turned to moosh against the back wall.  Then goes about explaining why warp drive is not possible because you cant handle the G-forces.  Wow!  What an insight.  Star Trek will probably tell you that there is other technology helping prevent this ... like inertial dampers perhaps, and the main deflector `deflecting' space dust?  This is all beside the point when you consider that Warp Drive is theoretical at this stage only, and it was made for TV.  It is like a University in USA that performed wind tunnel test to see how the Enterprise would handle space flight.  Then witting a report explaining that the design of the ship is totally wrong and it would break apart.  How stupid can you get, why would you bother going out of your way to disprove a fictional technology.  I would have preferred this book to acknowledge that the technology in star trek is not possible in its current form, but would it not be wonderful if we could transport from one place to another in a blink of an eye, and this is how it might work?  If you are considering this book as part of your star trek collection, better look elsewhere.  Anoth reviewers wrote the following that I think are importaint points also...  Mr. Krauss does a great job of explaining why Star Trek technology is impossible in the real world. What I wanted to know was how it worked in the Star Trek world. -"rickandsue" (Weymouth, MA United States)  ...And all his assumptions on the technology is using modern day physics, which is portrayed by the author as the absolute truth to the universe. 500 years ago it was impossible to circumnavigate the earth, 50 it was the sound barrier, I suprise a scientist would say that anything(such as warp drive) is impossible no matter what improvement in physics. -locutus@oz.net "fedallah4" (Silverdale, Washington) 
 The people rating this high must be paid to do so.  It's just riddled with historical inaccuracy ... Fuller's book on this topic is SO much better that I'm still kicking myself for buying this.    Just because I made the mistake doesn't mean you have to. 
 This is poorly casted and scripted movie, has only one thing going for it, No annoying Chevy Chase around to make unfunny jokes, he did not have too, The cast here do that in abundance 
 I was very excited to receive the Armoire this past weekend.  However, after opening the package we found a crack on one of the pieces.  I called Strokcraft directly to see what the alternatives were for this type of issue.  The only way to compensate for the issue was replacement of the part. The rep indicated that the delivery of the new part can take anywhere from 3-4 weeks.  With the baby coming in within a week or so, who has the time to wait. The product is what you pay for.  
 As a parent of 3 boys who love Star Wars, we are constantly purchasing books.  We have always purchased them at Borders (or stores of the like).  This was the first time I purchased a book on-line thru Amazon.  Within ONE MONTH the binding came unglued.  This has never occured with any of the other Star Wars books we've purchased.  My boys are very protective of their books and take care of them.  We now have a book with the hard-cover off and I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED and due to this do not plan on purchasing online thru Amazon if this is the quality I am to expect in the future 
 The under read writers in this anthology should be very grateful for Peter Jackson, the director of Bad Taste whose studio franchise benefits them. But Tolkien would have found little to admire here, consider Ursula Leguin a feminist academic bandied about in the political science department at U.C. Berkley and editor of The Oxford Book of Science Fiction, which is just a collection leftist propaganda. Tolkien who disliked newspapers and barely ever read them would have found the hyper contemporizing mis-readings here incomprehensible 
 I couldn't get into the stories or the characters....  I like short stories and novellas, and was hoping for something in the vein of Ray Bradbury or Stephen King...or Robert Heinlein...  ...I found none of that in Gibson's "Burning Chrome".. 
 hard to set up and use. no directions and can't find anything on the web.  Would not buy if I knew this 
 Very dissapointing.  The inexpensive foam of the ball just disintigrates in certain rims 
 This UK/Luxembourg film stars Madeleine Stowe as Senga, tired mother driving a car at midnight with her daughter Nat (Mischa Burton).  They have been, it seems, on bad terms recently, and Senga is getting more and more nervous as they drive on.  But some curious and unnerving things happen to them on the way home, which they have to deal with on their own.  For starters, one hichhiker (Bijou Phillips) came on board, and mystreiously disappears into the darkness.  Then, after bitter argument with Nat, Senga finds her daughter missing, perhaps kidnapped, in the diner on the roadside.  [CREEPY ATMOSPHERE, AWFUL STORY]  Like his previous supernatural horror 'Long Time Dead' Marcus Adams as director shows considerable skills to create creepy atmosphere on the screen.  Though the picture is too dark at times (and almost all the events happen at one night), it also realizes certain amount of strangely unreal feeling of staying up late at 3pm in the morning.  But the script is simply awful, especially in the last 30 minutes, where everything is explained with cliched items like 'cult,' and everything still remains confusing and unbelievable.  Norman Reedus plays a 'Recovery Man' whose identity turns out so incredible.  And when Jonathan Rhys-Meyers appears as 'The Father' who utters incomprehensive nonsense before the bedazzled Nat (who listens to them seriously ... no kidding!), everything falls apart.  This film reminded me of Peter Fonda's 1975 shocker 'Ride with the Devil' in which four unsuspecting travellers are terrorized by the mysterious local cult group.  Though that film was a B-action/horror film, it was at least coherent to the end.  And the ending was more effective than this one's.             
 I received an email from amazon asking me to review this item I had purchased.  This item never arrived from Macy's.  I emailed them and they said they would ship it immediately and I would have it in ten business days.  3 weeks later I still didnt have the item.  I contacted them back and was advised the item is no longer available.  My account was ( reportedly ) credited but poor service on this item 
 All Joyce Johnson does in this book is drop names about people she knew and complain that she was born in the wrong generation.  Don't waste your money on this book. Just go to your nearest old folks home and hear about how they "knew" JFK. It's free and doesn't waste 5 hours of your lif 
 ...and use the techniques in this book on the book itself.  Sadly, a book with so much promise falls victim to its own PR machine all too often.  Face it, if you're going to use critical thinking, use it consistently.  If you use it against what you don't like, but cast a blind eye on things you are passionate about, how critical is that, really 
 I love Vincent Price and have many of his movies but this one I wish I had not bought. It is really stupid. It was one of his later movies that he probably made just to have work  
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 The builtin speakers in my laptop sounded better and louder than these speakers.  The Sony's highs are muddy and the volume does not go very loud (yes my laptop volume was all the way up).  If you want extra laptop speakers for your presentations with clients look elsewhere.  All we wanted was a decent quality sound that was a little louder than our laptop speakers and these speakers definitely did not deliver and will be returned.  If you need ultra portable sound and your laptop speakers are broken or sound much worse than average laptops (we have nothing special), then maybe this would work for you. 
 Why is it ever time you want something bad enough it usually turns out bad? After the wonderful Quinn trilogy fans (including me) begged and begged for Nora Roberts to write Seth's story. After all we journeyed with Seth through we wanted to see him fall in love. Nora Roberts repeatedly said she would not write one. But us fans kept on begging for it and were excited when she finally gave in and wrote it. And we got Chesapeake Blue. Reading it you know you should be grateful because you wanted Seth's story but....this wasn't what I (and my fellow NR fans friends) wanted. First of all I wanted the heroine to be Aubrey. After their beautiful friendship in the Quinn trilogy I expected her to be Seth's love interest. But I tried to keep an open mind after all I loved Anna, Grace, and Sybill, but Dru Whitcomb Banks was a completely let down. All she did was whine and complain about her life which were minor compared to what Cam, Ethan, Philip, and Seth experienced as children. Seth becoming an artist was a surprise too I expected him to join the family business and design boats. The Gloria blackmailing him was a very thin and bad plotline. There's no reason Gloria would want to contact him considering all the warrents for her and that Seth wouldn't tell his family considering the Quinn Brothers (and wives)worked their so hard to keep him away from her. I closed this book vowing never to request, beg or petition an author to write a book when they say they don't want to. Because this is what you get 
 I purchased this for myself and my 7 year old to play with. The screen is way too dark to be able to use at dusk or after, but if in direct sunlight, you can't see it either. It's pretty small (buttons and screen) and a little confusing. If you are a person who is using hard earned money to purchase this, then don't. But if you just want to check it out and be okay with not wanting it later or losing the money you spent, go for it 
 While I appreciate that this is a popular series, as an elementary educator from Hawai'i I would like Amazon customers to consider not buying this particular installment of the Tree House books.  It perpetuates the most ridiculous stereotypes of Hawai'i and Hawaiians.  It makes Native Hawaiians out to be ignorant and indebted to a boy for his superior knowledge -- this is simply a repetition of the old story that Pacific Islanders needed to be saved by the West.  At the risk of being cynical, how about a book that explains how the kids did not save Native Hawaiians from the near genocide that followed contact with the West?  There are many good books for kids set in Hawai'i, written by people who know the Islands, its history and traditions.  Please look for books like these -- The Fish and Its Gifts/Na Makana a Na I'a, Bon Dance in Hawai'i, To Find the Way, or Mr. Miyataki's Wonderful Machine. 
 My initital impressions of 'American Gods' were nearly uniformly positive.  Although I had not read any reviews previous, I was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel.  But like a doomed traveler in Fred Pohl's 'Gateway', the book never achieved "turn-a-round".  The central storyline is further and further pushed off, and often seems to occur on the sidelines.  Gaiman's prose is engaging and easy to slip into, but I felt empty in the end, without significant payoff or a true sense of journey.  Those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by Tim Powers.  "Last Call" in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to "Gods 
 I AM A BIG FAN OF THIS SERIES AND HAVE READ THE BOOKS TWICE...ALL BUT THIS ONE. I WISH I HAD NOT EVEN READ IT ONCE AS THE SO CALLED "TWISTS" IN IT DEALING WITH BILL AND ERIC DO NOT FIT IN WITH THE REST OF THE SERIES AND LEFT ME FEELING TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED WITH MS. HARRIS'S PLOT. IT WAS JUST PLAIN NOT FUN 
 Skateboarding could really do without self conscious myth making like this. One part that really got me mad was the film maker saying "These guys were making history every single day!" or something to that effect. Who are the egotistical ones, the filmakers there to get rich and famous or the skaters who made their own decks and skated curbs in the rain for the enjoyment of it? I eventually flicked channels half way through the movie after a piece of dubious editing.  Stuff like this gets in the way of skateboarding 
 there was hardly any mention of Pixel the cat, it was alot of dialog, tried to resemble a fast paced action book, but I found myself skimming over alot of the text after a while.......for a female I like action and for the plot to move along........there was too much about dumb sexual innuendos about swinging, and multiple partner sex.I felt like the over tone to the book was "well ok we all have alot of sex with LOTS of different people in the future" it was too focused on that ...I liked "Stranger In a Strange Land" alot better. By the time I was through with this book I kind of felt almost like he was just slapping stuff on a page. 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 I bought this in the expectation that it would cover the People of the "New World" as they existed before Columbus.  Instead, it was basically a recap of the cruelty of the Europeans to the native populations viewed through the standards and sensibilities of today. I read 'Bury My Heary at Wounded Knee' and 'The Chronicle of the American Indian's Complaint' 30 odd years ago and being part Cherokee there was nothing new in the DVDs.  Correction, there were many new things, most of which didn't happen.  A good example is the DVD version of the conquering of the Aztec (Actually they were called Mexica but the DVD got that wrong as well).  Read 'Conquest' by Hugh Thomas for the best book on the subject 
 I agree.  This book is not as focused as the beginners the story line was weak and it just seemed as if he was occipied with something else 
 More than two million jobs disappeared from the U.S. between '01 and '04 - half a million in high-tech industries alone. Further, Steven Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley, estimates that there have been about 8 million fewer jobs in the current recovery than would have been expected from prior history, and most of the new jobs come with low wages and few benefits.    Berger knows these numbers have caused a rising fear that no American job is safe from low-wage countries.  To discover whether these fears are justified, Berger and a group of MIT researchers visited over 500 workplaces and factories around the world.  Their conclusion is that cheap labor is not the answer.   This conclusion is currently true in some instances; however, the authors fail to see that cheap labor (the "China price") is increasingly dominating decision-making - both in services and manufacturing.  Jobs that formerly were not candidates for outsourcing (finance, market research, industrial design, computer systems design, paralegal research, reading X-rays) now are; strategies that previously fought off Asian alternatives often fail to work several years later as China and India adopt new techniques; in fact the authors often cite previously highly successful American companies that subsequently succumbed.    G.M. and Ford are additional examples where this may yet happen - despite years of world-leadership. Part of their problem was believing that they could let Japan have the low-cost market - this worked for awhile, but now Toyota et al have applied the lessons learned in that market segment, and leveraged their distribution etc. systems on to producing competitive SUVs and innovative hybrids as well.  Meanwhile, Toyota sees Korea and China as its most formidable future challenges, and despite its vaunted Toyota Production System, maintaining direct control throughout all stages (so does Microsoft, but that hasn't kept it from substantial outsourcing to India), and co-locating with suppliers, is seriously looking at China.  Remember Visteon and Delphi (Ford and G.M.'s former parts arms)?  Spinning them off was supposed to encourage more companies to utilize them, and it worked - for a time.  Today's successes are far too often ephemeral!  To be fair, the authors also point out that studies and analyses on the impact of outsourcing reach conclusions all over the map.  However, I think the most accurate (and certainly highly credible) conclusion is that of former MIT economist (and Nobel prize-winner) Paul Samuelson - globalization should increase the world's total income and average standard of living, but there's no reason to think any particular country or region's advances will outweigh its losses.  Berger, et al, also go on to recommend substantially improving American education.  The "bad news" is that this has been tried for at least 30 years, with little impact.  Further, others have determined that Asian IQs average about ten points over that of American whites.  Regardless, what difference would improving education make, even if we did achieve equality with Asian outcomes, when the workers are paid but a fraction of Americans?  Berger does mention the rationale for foreign corporations choosing to continue building millions of cars in the U.S. - laws requiring U.S. content.  Toyota, Nissan, Mercedes, BMW, Subaru, VW and others have built large plants in the U.S. as a result of this act.  However, the authors fail to recognize this as a potentially strong and viable overall solution to the hollowing of America.  Another important omission is the problem of outsourcing large numbers of jobs to illegals within this country - in fact, Berger et al reference a situation involving such as a solution!  Estimates are that AT LEAST nine million illegals from Mexico are here - depressing wage levels and stealing jobs that Americans formerly did. And what about the large number of Canadian truck drivers within the U.S. - soon to be augmented by Mexicans. (There are NO American truck drivers in Mexico that I know of, and very few that I've seen in Canada.) Then there is the self-inflicted problem of L1 and H1B visas bringing hundreds of thousands more, albeit legally.  While technically not "outsourcing," the impact of each of the preceding is the same.  Another thought from some "experts" is that sending off the lower-level jobs allows the U.S. to focus on "higher level" jobs such as innovation.  That's ridiculous for at least two reasons:  1)Manufacturing, for example, involves more than drilling, welding, molding, etc.  It also involves design, production management, production layout, machine design, etc.  These are NOT low-level jobs, nor is operating highly technical equipment.  2)How are all the displaced workers going to become eg. biomedical researchers, rocket scientists, etc.?  (Oh yes, the Chinese and Indians are moving into those areas also; I have encountered a number of Americans who took recommended training in new areas after being "outsourced" from a long-term occupation only to become outsourced again.)  Also missing from "How We Compete" is any discussion and recommendation on healthcare.  Auto manufacturers repeatedly claim that having to pay healthcare for their employees adds $1,000+ cost to each car - creating government-funded universal healthcare like other nations would help save jobs in America.  "How We Compete" address an important topic - however, its focus on CURRENT approaches (vs. trends) results in conclusions that are seriously over-optimistic.  (Inadequate analysis by Berger and others helps explain the maze of contradictory conclusions on this topic; political and economic motivations of short-sighted clients are additional drivers.)  Eight million jobs here, nine million there, etc., etc. - it adds up and hurts a lot.  Meanwhile, America's competitive status declines daily and our government does little or nothing in defense 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 The Band deserves a first rate boxed set, and we have seen various greatest hits and other packages.  The problem with this collection, besides its inflated price, is that the two main audiences for this (completists & solid fans) are both poorly served by this bilious box.    Completists will have all of the previously released stuff and will be wasting money on having it all yet again.  Dedicated followers (not fanatics), mainly drawn by the idea of a single source for some of the best released material, will be wasting money on alternate takes and previously unreleased material which just does not live up to the released material.  Remember, there is usually a reason unreleased material was "unreleased."  The book, etc. will sit on the shelf after one read through.   Why did I purchase this?  I am a Band completist - albeit one who feels more than a bit ripped off by this over-inflated marketer's ploy to pull in both segments of the market.    My advice for the 90% of the people who just want a really good Band collection?  Find the out of print two CD set "Kingdom Come," and pick up the "Last Waltz," and you will be MUCH happier, and still several bucks ahead of the game.  
 I purchased this product, but after 3 months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away.  The first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder!  The effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it's subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress, the solder breaks.  You then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection.  I replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter.  The second problem is that when I unplugged the power adapter from the wall, it would cause my laptop (IBM T20) to emergency power off.  Unplugged at the laptop plug was fine.  I understand this to be an issue between the T20 power system and a surge issue in the adapter.  I replaced this with a Kensington 33197 120W adapter.  It looks almost like the same product (same OEM?) except they have stronger power tips.  It also didn't have the power-off issue.  I loved the form factor, but the product just didn't work 
 This book was rather fun to read but I am not convinced that the authors have as deep an understanding of the phenomena they are writing about as they would like the readers to believe.  The book reads like a narrative, full of assertions that are not backed by rigorous analysis of hard evidence.  The authors do not critically explore causal relationships, nor do they talk about research that has done so.  They present only one particular perspective on the unfolding of events, and they do not defend this perspective against potential criticism.  My experience with economics has always reinforced the idea that causality can be difficult to establish, and can often operate in unexpected ways.  An economist must proceed skeptically, being careful to explore alternative explanations and being prepared to defend assertions with theory and data.  The authors do not seem to share this view, taking instead a more naive approach.  Maybe I was expecting too much; after all this book is meant to be accessible to non-economists.  However, making a book more accessible does not necessitate a lack of rigour or the absence of critical thought; the authors could have removed some of the redundancy in the book (their writing is far from concise!) and replaced it with explorations of alternative perspectives.  The book would be greatly enriched by adding more discussion of research that supports (or opposes) their views 
 Good story and fast read but too much graphic sex.  I like my imagination better than all of the graphic details 
 Well I ordered this for my granddaughter as she loves Olivia.  To my surprise (thanks to ordering in hurry I guess) I received it today and discovered it is a BLANK BOOK.  This is not the story, it is just a journal.  A four-year-old would not want it.  This is just to warn otheres to read what it is you are ordering so no one else is disappointed.  Now I have to return and re-order 
 Davis's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition.  Then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling.  White men were all bad, indians were good.  Women were brave.  Conservatives are anti-semites.  Republicans are bad and pro business.  Anti-communism was silly. And all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor's filter. Mr. Davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy.  This is offensive when it neglects Margaret Sanger's racism, and communist depredations 
 My seven-year-old received this car for Christmas from Santa.  One of the front bumpers broke off the first day.  Within a week the remote control was broken & the car can't go far from the remote 
 "Nobody touches the Lonely Planet for budget travel advice," states the back cover of this book.   I just finished travelling around Southeast Asia with this as my primary guidebook. It includes the basics for getting around, eating, etc... but it really is just the basics. I have used other books from the lonely planet series in the past, and have found them good enough to continue using, at least until this volume. It has been 5 years since I was in this region last, and things have changed. Especially the guidebook, which was once a rich trove of off-the-beaten-path hints and tips. Increasingly, however, it seems that the Lonely Planet authors seem less interested in helping you find a unique experience and more interested in serving up a cookie-cutter, package tourist rehash. I have a couple grievances with this book:    -It insists on constantly pointing out little sidebars entitled "Splurge!" which indicate ways that the budget traveller can spend a great deal of money in one shot. Why this is in a travel guide called "shoestring" I couldn't tell you. Neither do the authors, but I suppose we can assume that backpackers are interested in spending $5 a night for a couple of months and then blowing $150 to stay in some posh hotel in Kuala Lumpur or racking up an additional $20 in credit card debt for an entirely forgettable dining experience in Bangkok. I just don't feel these are relevant to 99% of actual budget travellers, but they waste a lot of space that could be much better used on greater detail. But I will get to that in a minute.    -Another issue I have is the lack of actual information about actually moving from one place to the next cheaply.  Cheap local transport is available in many of the places covered in the book.  For some reason though, the book usually offers helpful advice like 'just take a cab,' or 'buses are so cheap, so don't bother with local transport.'  As an independent traveler that actually enjoys saving money AND spending time with the locals (what's the purpose of traveling again?!?!), I regret the lack of information about local transport.    -The maps in the book, though better than some in past editions, leave much to be desired. Streets are incorrectly labeled or in the wrong place, intersections are vaguely marked, and occasionally they add a street that doesn't exist or remove a street that does. Worst of all, in a region that prides itself on an almost complete lack of road signage, not many good landmarks are given to orient oneself. There is little that is less fun on the road than standing in front of a train station, staring at one's new alien surroundings, being hassled by touts who are trying to steer you in the wrong direction while trying to find that cheap hostel you read about.    Look, if you want a run-of-the-mill book to complete a run-of-the-mill trip, by all means, you will find this book quite helpful.  But if you are looking for that individual experience that is the beauty of independent travel, you might be best going with a different guide for this region.    By the way, the quote I wrote at the beginning should be viewed as a warning rather than an enticemen 
 Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book 
 I was disappointed with this publication. Having been a Pan American stewardess from 1956-58 and stationed in New York, I was looking forward to seeing something about Pan Am. It was a great airline at the time and I thought it deserved more than a small photo. Quantas and other foreign airlines got more press. 
 I love the idea of this... sleek, out of the way for transit but  readily available on the road, protected when not in use.  Unfortunately, the reality is a hard to use product that does little to improve road safety. Because of the narrowness of the mirror, it's very difficult to focus on what  is actually behind you with a quick glance.  Sure, if you sit there for 10  seconds you can figure it out, but I don't have that sort of time when I'm  dodging through Chicago traffic!  Save your money and buy the excellent Mirrcycle instead 
 I support the other comment made by a poster: Editor, where were you when this book was written? The writing is so terrible. Maybe .37 is too much for this book actually 
 I gave this release only 2 stars because it de-emphasizes their best stuff.  "Jealousy" is one of the best albums I have in my collection of 600+ albums.  "Fire In The Sky" is an awesome song from that album.  I really wish they would have released more stuff like this before they went back to hillbilly 
 Based on Mr. Shamsul Akmar's editorial commentary from daily English based newspaper The Star in peninsular Malaysia, is this book really worth reading 
 There are plenty of projects, but I wouldn't say it is for advanced users. It is a cookbook that introduces few, if any, advanced concepts. If you are an advanced user of After Effects looking for something more, then I recommend the Meyers books or the Total Training DVD's 
 I enjoyed the first 3 books of the Women's Murder Club. Didn't like too much the 4th (of July), but the 5th is just BAD ! What's the plot ? There is no plot ! 2 serial-killer stories try to share the pages of this not-such-a-page-turner, the 1st mystery (Car Girls) get solved mid-way throught the book and I bet plenty of readers won't remember it by the end of this painfull read... By trying to develop 2 stories, Patterson gets our interest for none. The most sad thing of all is that I used to like to Women's Murder Club members, but now they all seem so unreal, remote from anything actually likeable. And it's been the case since one of them died and another one joined the club, in the most stupid, artificial way really. Not much to save this book, it's even badly written. Don't know if Patterson thinks about writting a 6th, but don't count on me next time  
 this sucked for real, they need to make a better video than this sh$t 
 I gave this book a reading not too long ago. Nothing about this book is "controversial". It's the same manipulation of information that neo-nazis and the kkk use to put shame to folks of other races. Books like these have always existed, and their purpose is to make money from readers who think the message is "ground-breaking" or revealing of some deep knowledge that has always been hidden from the public. If you plan on picking up this book, be sure to pick up a confederate flag and a few skrewdriver albums to go with it, this book is equally brainless 
 I am a very happy wife and mother, with fairly conservative views.  As someone who's career is in research, I am disgusted with what others are considering "well researched".  The author has taken facts and twisted to her own advantage, and to the disservice of women.  The "supporting facts" in the book are as comical as the cover.  This author attempts to make a few good points, but then ruins her concepts with overwhelming bias 
 Another one of these self published books that I have been sucked into buying (like "The Great Pretender"!!) because all of the author's friends and Publisher's acquantances have logged onto Amazon and written positive reviews.  This is part of the deal when a new author signs on to get their book published.  Really poorly written.  Terrible waste of money and time, I am glad I bought it used.  DON'T BUY INTO THE HYPE 
 Karen Armstrong, some of whose other books I've found illuminating, really fails here in a big way. This book presents a whitewashed picture, a romanticised history of the founder of Islam. She carries on about "islamophobia" and the crusades but is silent about the Islamic incursions into Europe centuries before the crusades. In other words, she ignores Islamic imperialism. Unfortunately, it soon becomes clear that the entire book is a compendium of half-truths, distortions, omissions and wishful thinking.   The chapters are titled Mecca, Jahilliyah, Hijrah, Jihad and Salam. There are 2 maps, notes, and a glossary without the word Dhimmitude, which is very telling. The book lacks an index. The author paints Islam as a religion of peace and reconciliation and incorrectly states that the word means "peace." The real meaning of Islam is "submission", as I'm sure Ms Armstrong must know very well. She also insists on interpreting the word Jihad as "struggle" in the sense of personal struggle, ignoring the numerous sayings preserved in the hadith that indicate the opposite.  What I found most shocking was Armstrong's attempts to whitewash the murder of the men of the Jewish Qurayzah tribe and the selling of the children and women into slavery. She denies Muslim anti-semitism and the inferior status and sometimes active persecution of Non-Muslims - as noted before, you won't easily find the word Dhimmi in this book. Her defence of polygamy is unconvincing and comprises many pages painful to read. The tone of the book is quite touchy-feely, supported by highly selective quotes from the Quran.   One wonders whether Karen Armstrong deliberately engages in intellectual dishonesty or if she just lives in a make-believe world where the frame of reference is multiculturalism, relativism and postmodernism. This book is flled with distortions and romantic delusions. To get a more balanced perspective, I highly recommend The Truth About Mohammed by Robert Spencer, Islamic Imperialism by Efraim Karsh, The Force Of Reason by Oriana Fallaci and the work of Bat Ye'or and Ayaan Hirsi Ali 
 The author borrows from several world belief systems and tries to pass them off as ancient "toltec" wisdom.  It does contain sprinklings of common sense, but the common sense is offset by impractical application as well as impractical implications.  Furthermore, the author contradicts himself at times.  On the other hand, if you are a fan of Deepak Chopra you will probably like this book as it is in the same vein.  
 Pros:  solid construction, good feel, excellent sound quality, works with power out Cons:  keypad isn't backlit, caller ID isn't backlit (contradicts advertising as of 9/19/2004!), if on table then caller ID visible only when looking down at phone Neutral:  caller ID and programmable buttons (3 of them) dependent on 3 AA batteries  I've been on a quest for the perfect corded phone.  I wanted something with a cord so that there's at least one working phone in the event of a power outage, and I wanted caller ID since I enjoy knowing who I'm going to be stuck talking to when I pick up the phone.  One of my requirements for caller ID is that it have a backlit display so I wouldn't have to turn on the light in the middle of the night if I got a call.  I tried the AT&T 210 trimline paired up with the GE 29096 caller ID box, but that didn't work well since the box wasn't backlit and it kept clicking on the line as if it were trying to flash it.  So you can imagine my delight after having read the specs on the AT&T 240 corded phone.  According to the information on Amazon.com, it had the trimline profile that I like, a heavier weight to the handset so it doesn't feel flimsy, and a backlit caller ID unit built into the back of the handset.  Plus, it was inexpensive.  I bought one immediately.  When I unboxed it, I was happy with the weight and design of the phone, even though it doesn't have a backlit keypad like the trimline phones of old do, like the AT&T 210 that I was using.  A pity, since that's a nice feature and one for which I would have been glad to pay more.  So anyway, I hooked it up and tested it out.  The phone had a good feel to it, comfortable to hold as well as cradle between ear and shoulder.  The quality of the sound was excellent, both clear and without the tinny sound that can result from the audio compression in cordless phones.  I only had one complaint, but it was a major one:  the caller ID wasn't backlit.  Moreover, there was nothing in the instruction manual indicating that it was supposed to be, either.  This was a big gripe since the real feature of this phone for me was the backlit caller ID that Amazon.com advertises.  A possible problem for others considering the 240 as a telephone would be the orientation of the caller ID window.  As it's on the top of the handset, you have to be looking down at the phone if you decide to rest it on a table or nightstand, i.e., there is no accessory to clip on the back to give it an angled elevation nor, due to the location and style of the rubber feet, can an impromptu one be constructed.  This essentially means that if you rest the phone on a table then the caller ID window is viewable only if you stand up, lean over, or pick up the entire phone along with the base and look at it.  Of course, if you don't care who's calling then you can pick up the phone and just take your chances; to me, however, this defeats my main reason for caller ID -- not having to talk to people I don't want to.  If you just use it as a phonebook of recent callers, then this isn't a problem.  Also, if you wall mount the telephone then this isn't an issue at all.  I use this telephone in my bedroom but have it wall-mounted next to the bed so I can see the caller ID just fine...in the light, that is.  So, in conclusion, the AT&T 240 is a corded phone with great sound quality and a good feel to it.  I wish that the keypad were backlit and I'm quite unhappy that the caller ID window isn't backlit.  This is a good corded phone that, with a longer cord, could be a great wall-mounted kitchen phone.  I would not recommend it for a location where the lights may be out or the area could be dimly lit.  I am presently using it for a bedroom phone, but if I find another corded phone in a trimline model that has a real backlit caller ID then I will probably switch and move this phone to the kitchen or in a spare drawer for storage.  
 I love history and political science but couldn't quite make my way through this one.  Make sure you have the option of returning this one if you buy it 
 I wanted to like this book, really.  I thought it was supposed to be a Book of Exalted Deeds for the Forgotten Realms, sort of like how Champions of Ruin was a Book of Vile Darkness for the Realms.  And surely, surely it'd have something usable for all classes, right?  I was so completely and utterly wrong.  I'm so glad this was purchased with a gift certificate.  First, the introduction points out that it's for "valorous" heroes...not necessarily good, as they define "valorous" to mean "fights evil things", which can be stretched to include evil priests fighting other evil priests.  Granted, there isn't much of that, but there's more about Neutral characters and organizations than I think appropriate.  Second, while there is a great deal of useful information for paladins, I challenge you to find anything for a good rogue.  At all.  No feats, no substitution levels, nothing.  It's terribly disappointing.  Now, there are a few good things.  There is a plethora of substitution levels, which are used to differentiate members of a class in an organization from those who aren't.  This is a nice use of them, and it's a real shame that half of these are paladins of one form or another.  The fluff's nice, and I hear a lot of people like the information on the various horse breeds in the back.  On the other hand, this continues the use of the fat, bloated, 4-page prestige class format, as well as the fat, bloated, corpulent magic item description format.  Because there's nothing more useful than two pages of history for a +3 outsider bane greatsword, and I just so need fully half of the prestige classes in the book devoted to characters with flying mounts.  Bottom line, this has very limited utility and portability.  It's great if you're playing a paladin in the Forgotten Realms who wants a flying mount, but if not, try and convince your friend to buy it.  Don't waste your money 
 This book was not actually written by "Larry the Cable Guy," but a gentleman named Dan Whitney.  Whitney is the human being who plays the character "Larry the Cable Guy" in concerts, movies, TV shows, CDs, and now this book.  What Dan Whitney really thinks about anything is up for conjecture, but he certainly knows what he wants people to think his character "Larry the Cable Guy" thinks.  In that way, this book succeeds marvelously, it makes fun of all the things Whitney has observed as making LTCG fans mad, and like president they all voted for, he tells them what something is and whether it is good, bad, or funny (i.e., jesus = good, fart = funny, being retarded = funny, not supporting the Bush administration = bad) and requires only confirmation by repetition of the catch phrase title of the book, and purchase of sundry items bearing the same inscription.  It is brilliantly targeted and presented for maximum cash-in value, with very little discussion and no thought involved at all.  It is the easiest thing in the world to be a  Larry fan because you don't even have to know what is funny, good, or bad, just wait for Larry to sum it up in the simplest little joke imaginable.   That is because he has calculated that if he talks in a thick southern accent (the origin of which is never revealed because it is an amalgam) people will think "wow, he really must be a down to earth fellow to unabashadly parade his hick background instead of trying to "unhickify" himself to reach a wider audience.  The unhickified Dan Whitney was boring and not funny, so he devised the Larry character to play on people who thought a brash, "honest" guy from the south was more funny.  It's a beautiful formula, and Larry is a gazillionaire as a result.    He may have paid  a few visits to a Waffle House to take notes, but you can be assured that establishment does not cater the spread on Dan Whitney's Gulfstream V.  So if you're wondering whether Larry sounds like he's from east Texas, western Louisiana, central Alabama, northeast Arkansas, Northen Florida, southern South Carolina, or smack dab in the middle of Georgia, don't labor too hard, he comes from Nebraska and the accent is fake.  Just like all the heartfelt nonsense in this book he is simply describing what he thinks the big fans of LTCG want to hear.  So if you want to be told what you want to hear by what is basically a cartoon character, instead of engaging in thought about a real human being, then welcome to the world of Larry The Cable Guy.  Just like Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, and Jesus, he's not real.  Is that un-PC enough for you, Dan 
 Terribly, terribly, terribly boring. I do not wish this torment on my worst enemy. Do not read it. There is not even a summary online, which means, nobody could endure the agony to finish this damn book 
 I was expecting much more than what I got with this "sticker Chart" and it was not worth the $9.75 I paid for it.  You are much better off to purchase the Fisher Price Potty Chair that has a chart & stickers that come with it.  My daughter enjoys that chart & stickers much better & it came free with her potty chair 
   The book is really old- getting close to a century- but some of the practical advice is sound.  Some of course is bereft of anything but historical value.  If you want a practical guide, you can find better 
 Ms. Klausner's review gave me pause.  As satire, this book would have been interesting and would have merited her glowing review.  Unfortunately, I think the author was utterly serious with this book.  The turgid focus is mindnumbing, without ever being attractive or interesting.  The perpetrators of the central mystery are obvious.  And yet...Mr. Ryan can write.  He held my interest all the while I said "this is appalling, what a narrowminded, pig".  I would buy a paperback of the sequel in December to see how the lead character changes, now that she is leaving being a tigress behind 
 Obviously, this book is wrong.  Mark Felt was identified as Deep Throat.  However, I think there is a larger example to conisder here.  The DT question was one of the biggest mysteries of our time.  Many books were written on the subject, some with much investigation.  From what I see, they were ALL wrong.  Keep this in mind when you read other books that purport to hold an answer to a big modern mystery.  This is commonsense, but it is easy to get wrapped up in a person's theory when they create a book and hype it. Think of how many other books are just as worthless as this one 
 Bland, bland, and more bland.  It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.  With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable.  And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.  It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity 
 This is a really useful book, tons of tips, saved me a lot $$ and time.  The downside is too heavy to carry in the parks. The most valuable thing I learn is to rent a multi-family vacation house with my friends, 16 people for only $199 a day. We all enjoy the stay at a spacious luxury resort. check this out: http://www.cyberrentals.com/index.cfm/property/12668 
 And folk revivalism is what it is, folks; I'll label it even if the populists fume at me because I know of more than 5 genres.  Meloy admits in interview after interview his taste for the Fairport Convention, Pentangle, and above all Shirely Collins.  He even did an album of "covers" of Shirley Collins' arrangements of British traditionals, a ridiculous concept if I ever heard of one.  Why cover another singer's versions of TRADITIONAL songs?  This idiocy should evince Meloy's alienation from a long tradition of reinterpretations of British folk music, and indeed most of his oeuvre consists of feeble attempts at ballad composition.  With no prosodic skill, he goes about constructing narratives modeled on such work as Shirley Collins' repertoire.  Evidently Meloy believes he can pen ballads as if he were a Walter Scott, S.T.C. or John Keats, but his weak stories show throughout the imaginative poverty of an American desperately attempting to beat an escape to the land of faerie.  The wistfulness and Romantic nostalgia of Meloy's work come off as trite and calculated for NPR yuppies.  Moreover, his vocal range consists entirely of yelp, melancholy warble and nasal whine--this whingeing troubadour sounds as if he constantly has a cold.  I'll admit the band is at least competent, but do yourself a favor: buy Comus' "First Utterance," the Incredible String Band's "The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter" or Shirley Collins' "No Roses" instead 
 I wish I could give this Zero stars.  It is a very dark book and I can't imagine why anyone would write, publish, gift it, or read it.  There is so much good literature written why do we lower ourselves to this junk?  Garbage in garbage out!  
 I bought the book for my girlfriend, but found myself without a book to read. I expected to find a nice account of a start-up (I love those kinds of books). I couldn't get past the 2nd chapter. The sugary sweet telling of what MIGHT be a true story; the silly and unrealistic situations; and the contrived dialogue, which I can't imagine coming out or a real person's mouth, forced me to put this down If you are a 14 year old girl you might be drawn to the story, but if you are looking for an business account of how the three dog bakery was started this won't be for you 
 When the character who is narrating a lengthy novel is as unbelievable and artificial as Hannah Musgrave is in "The Darling", the book is not worthy of completing.    
 Not since the writing of Karl Marx has there been such garbage 
 After 5 boys my first daughter just HAD to have a pink highchair for her Princess 1st Birthday Party so I retired the boys trusty BLUE Graco (still in great shape after 4 years) into the basment and ordered this Pink one.  After what we paid for it ~ I don't know how to tell my husband I want the blue one back! (Maybe I can fnd a pink cover?!)  My daughter is 12 months old & 20 pounds and cannot reach the tray without dropping food into her lap.  There is a 3inch gap between her & the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap.  The thick padded seat is adorable & comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up.  The base is very large & her food falls down onto it after every meal so I am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well.  The buckles are awkward & impossible to do with one hand. If you have a petite baby ~ this is not the highchair for you 
 I subscribed in late May to MaximumPC and PCGamer. Early July I started getting PCGamer.  Still nothing from MaximumPC.  I called customer service and they said they had recieved my order June 2nd and to expect my first issue in late September. Thats nearly four months! That is an unreasonable wait relative to the industry standard and clearly outside the stated wait on the order form. I gave one star because the magazine is a good magazine. But at a $8.99 news stand price it is too expensive... so I am left with the choice of spending almost $35 to get the four months worth before my subscription starts (more than the subscription itself) or just missing out on those issue.  Very poor customer service.  
 Mr. Clark seems like a high energy, innovative soul who genuinely cares for his students.  The workbook, however, is disappointing.  It is mostly a compilation of busy work exercises.  One particular multiple-choice activity directs students to match a person with something he or she may have dropped.  I feel certain Mr. Clark's own role-playing activities (mentioned in his book The Essential 55) hold far more meaning and value for students.  Mr. Clark might better serve parents and teachers by providing suggestions, scenarios, and guidelines for managing those more memorable experiences.  
 Author is a Financial planner and recommends no self management of your own money.  Contains little original material most charts and tables are from the author's employer, Amex.  You will notice that each previous reviewer has only written a review on THIS book, and most reviewers are located near the authors home town in Michigan  What are the odds?  There is no over all plan in this book to manage your money, much less an original thought. Logic is heavily tilted towards using a planner and often nonsense. As an example on page 2 the author exhorts the value of Certified Financial Planner (CFP) with taken classes and exams, but on page 5 the reader will learn that a CFP takes a 2 day class and one test.  There are no impressive reviews or any review on the book cover except from the authors employer, Amex.  This book does not contain unbiased information.  Update:  The author is a part time professor at a local univeristy which 'encourages' publication  as a prof he might be great but as an author much room for improvement...  
 When I bought this book, I was already a "pre-trib" guy, and a big fan of the Left Behind series.  I thought this book would help me as a Bible student to have a clear grasp of Biblical eschatology.   After I read this book, I realized that the Bible has absolutely nothing to do with a secret rapture followed by seven years of anti-christ led chaos.  I was amazed at how weak and utterly careless Lahaye is in his exposistion of Scripture.  For instance, his insistance that the 'Day of the Lord' and the 'Day of Christ' must be differant.  One of his main arguments in favor of a secret rapture is that since judgement is not mentioned in John 14:1-3 or 1 Thess.4:16-17, this MUST be a seperate event from the final judgement!   One good thing that came from reading this book is that it led me to consider other interpretations of the end times.  For far more careful study, try "Four Views on the Book of Revelation," by C. Marvin Pate, "The Last Days according to Jesus," by R.C. Sproul, or my favorite, "The Church and the Last Things," by Martyn Lloyd-Jones 
 Okay- I know that this is a seminal work re: the Middle East, but it is as dry as any other history text that you might find on the shelves of MiddleEast 101.  In comparison to Price of Honor or other more reader friendly texts that in my opinion carry as much critical information about the volatile region, it pales in comparison 
 You can try to retcon me out of existence, but I'll show you!!! I'm in it for the long-haul. No hack comic book churners can get rid of a long-time fan favorite like myself. Not as a token death, not as a reimagining! I yam that I yam!  That said, I enter this series with some trepidation. On can clearly see that a 
 I was a little disappointed. There were a few tidbits that I liked but other than that, nothing I didn't know. Kind of a "preaching to the choir" kind of book in my opinion. 
 Being somewhat familiar with Marsden's writing I looked forward with great anticipation to reading this book. Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism are subjects with which I have significant familiarity and very great interest. The book was a disappointment and for me was simply a dreary recitation of facts with nothing to give it life 
 Let me make it clear that I've been a fan of Chimaira for 4 years since I first bought Pass Out Of Existence, and this album has been a favorite since the day it came out. Now, I originally was gonna pass on this. Normally, I don't if the extra material is good. All this has is a bonus cd with two cover songs from a previous band that 1 or 2 of the members were in, and the rest are live tracks from the Holland show that was on the Dehumanizing Process dvd, which is great if you want the audio element of that show, otherwise it's not worth it. Anyway, I was looking to get a newer copy of the album and decided on this special edition. First thing right when I opened it, the main cd popped out. The disc wasn't secure in the tray, and it wouldn't stay in. You couldn't even turn it over to look at the back of the case. Try flipping the tray over for the second disc and the other would fall out. For some it may not be a problem, but for someone like me who takes extremes in taking care of his cd's and has OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder if you don't know), it's irritating. So I went back to the store, exchanged it. They had two other copies, both had the same problem! I just said screw it and exchanged it for a newer copy of the regular version.  So if you already bought the original, don't waste your time with the special edition 
 Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:  "Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ..."  "Opens strong, but fizzles out early ..."  "I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ..."  "You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ... 
 I bought this for my nine year old daughter.  The game in theory is great, but ours does not work right, and the company is not real great to deal with.  I am still trying to get a replacement.  If the game worked properly, I would rate it 5 stars, easily.  Even my thirteen year old daughter loves it 
 This product is worthless. Save yourself the hassle and frustration of trying to get the radio and readouts to work and buy something else.   I've never been able to get the radio to work properly and the counters have gone blank. I'm really surprised that Amazon continues to sell this item with such terrible reviews continuing to come in 
 I give this book two stars for effort and its Christian perspective, but he reverts to the "forgive at all costs" mentality. Some things aren't forgivable, nor should people be expected to do so. This may lay an additional burden on people who are suffering, trivializes their injuries, and it gives the abuser an out. Still, a decent effort. Might be helpful in addition to counseling from a ministe 
 This book belongs to the George Steiner school of writing - extremely pretentious, aggressively obscure, frustratingly allusive, barely grammatical. (How can Cambridge, home of Russell and Moore, I. A. Richards and Wittgenstein, tolerate, let alone produce, this kind of pseudo-erudite claptrap?) Here is how Derrida would write if he wrote in English. Fortunately the virtues of clarity and solid, plain-spoken prose are more celebrated among English speakers than French, so Dunn is hardly likely to assume the mantle of public intellectual he so evidently craves. Move on: you're not missing anything here 
 Please read Naomi Jakobs' review for Relevant Magazine below. It captures so brilliantly and eloquently the heart of the Christian 'post-modern' kick. If you have to go out of your way to claim you're a celebrity, then you simply aren't a celebrity (Take "Fitness Celebrity" John Basedow for example). In the same way, if you have go out of your way to claim that the Post-modern Evangelical movement is relevant, then you're claim for relevancy is simply not credible. The Christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past 2000 years. However pop-culturalizing Evangelical Christianity isn't causing it to be any more relevant than it was when Sandi Patty or Carmen ruled the Christian top 40. Does the fact that some Christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood-sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable 
 I had to return this.  The poetry in the book was very nice, but the pictures were too abstract I think for a preschooler to grasp, and not particularly compelling for me as an adult who not only uses preschool nature books professionally but also collects them as a hobby.  
 Charles Adams is a man possessed: possessed of hatred for Abraham Lincoln, the North, and the United States of the 21st century.  That the book is not history is proven by its subtitle:  Arguing the Case for Southern Secession.  An historian would not argue a case for or against any historical event.  Like his counterpart Thomas DiLorenzo, Adams is an unhappy man who feels driven to trash the entire American historical scene with incomplete, anachronistic arguments.  Neither man delves deeply enough into history, although Adams is the better of the two in that regard.  Suffice it to say that if you truly want history, Adams and DiLorenzo are not the men to deliver it 
 Typical Feinstein ("A Season on the Brink" excepted).  Quick, gossipy, superficial, fawning, etc., etc.  This book is about the 2002 U.S. Open Golf Championship at the Bethpage Black Golf Course, a New York State Park course on Long Island.  The subtitle, "Inside the Ropes at Bethpage Black," is used here as a figure of speech, meaning "behind the scenes."  ("Inside the ropes" is normally used in the context of a professional golf tournament to refer to the actual playing area itself -- spectators are separated from the golfers, caddies, officials, and other chosen few by thin ropes that tell the spectators how close they can get to the action.)  Feinstein's purpose is to give the reader a look at the unfolding of a golf tournament from its conception to its completion.  We see U.S Golf Association (the organization that conducts the tournament) leaders in action and learn something about the logistics of putting on a golf tournament (e.g., 4,850 people willing to volunteer their time so that the professional golfers and U.S.G.A. can have a huge payday), about random qualifiers and random competitors, and about the resurrection of the Black golf course.  Yet the book does not fulfill its promise.  My guess is that Feinstein's indebted to too many golf people for both his past and anticipated future lifestyle to offer the kind of critical insights and analysis I had hoped for 
 Of course I want to restore my mind and body!  The title alone made me want to read the book.  However most of the "miraculous" claims are supported by case studies from the doctors' clinic without a single footnote referencing any medical study.  Those who are skeptical of traditional Western medicine MIGHT enjoy reading this.  However, I found that this book promoted a lot of unsubstantiated claims to cure whatever ails you.  Too good to be true usually is 
  First off, there is a big difference between the Chinese in Hong Kong (were much of this author's experience comes from) and the Chinese from Beijing. It's like the difference between Italy and Sweden.  Grouping all Chinese cultures together is just plain ignorant and down right misleading and it hurts your understanding of that region of the world.  It also makes the outside traveler appear a little stupid when they arrive in China.  This book seems to group all Chinese as one culture.   Culture Shock! China: is just bad book on so many levels that I have a headache reliving them all! I'd find better material to read about China; books that were written within the past 2 years are best!  China has changed so much and so fast that it's hard to keep up with all the changes.  Even the Chinese themselves are stunned at the rapid pace of change.    (Additional observation) It's very odd how this book received so many of its highest star ratings right after its re-release years ago.  This makes me suspect that maybe some employees from the publisher, (and/or friends of the author) might have been used to falsely rate this book with those great reviews and high stars, especially when it was more beneficial to sales back then. (look at the dates of the earlier high reviews with today's low star reviews.   ...hmmmm).   
 Pinter's work is the proof that you can manage to be boring without being longwinded. I have always found him close to impossible to read. As for the famous pauses and threats which make his onstage theatre so compelling to his fans, these I have found only heighten the annoying quality of  the reading.  Pinter is an heir of Beckett and belongs to 'The Real Mankind is the diminished broken fragment of itself' school.  But these broken voices, these characters always seeming to menace and imprison each other, present a kind of picture of humanity at one minor extreme only.  Pinter in his political work presents himself as a spokesman for the oppressed of Mankind and has for years attacked the  United States.   The United States is without its faults, mistakes and misjudgments nonetheless the single major force in the world which prevents Mankind from falling into a dark night of Totalitarian Terror.   To take advantage of the freedoms given by the world's democracies to attack in an exaggerated way these democracies  is the kind of moral teaching which can lead Mankind to nothing but a 'dark night of the soul' in which no one will ever dare to read the kind of literary work Pinter has devoted his life to. 
 I rated 2 stars and the price is $2.99. "LET IT WHIP" by the Dazz Band,  2nd is  " CELEBRATION" by Kool and the Gang,  3rd is the "SHAKE YOUR GROOVE THING" Peaches & Herb. The rest of the songs needs to be replace 
 Let me say right out that Sasha and Digweed are fantastic DJs, each in their own right, and that the Delta Heavy tour was an epic experience.  Unfortunately, this DVD does not pack the expected punch of the actual performance.  Make no mistake, this is NOT a concert footage DVD.  Instead you will find interviews galore detailing the logistics and documenting the events surrounding the Delta Heavy tour.  The music, for the most part, is not even live.  Too much talk, waste of money.  Pick up Sasha's Involver or Digweed's Fabric instead, forget the DVD.    
 Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling. 
 The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief.  I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz.  This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12.  This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I.  It is a fairytale.  Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.  This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time 
 The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical 
 The book contained too much detail on manufacturing.  I would have preferred the book to cover less ground.  The review entitled "Words, words, words", encompasses my view exactly.  Unfortunately I did not read all the reviews first.  I will not make that mistake again 
 What a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.  Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler]  But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together 
 This book is perpetuating false facts about Reiki and its history. Hayashi did not charge $10,000 for master level training as this book claims. And certainly Usui did not charge anywhere near $10,000 as the book is  suggesting. This book also states that Usui was a Christian monk, when in  fact he was Buddhist. Another false fact presented in this book is that  Hayashi was Usui's successor, when we know through research it was Ushida.  The society that Usui founded in 1922 still exists today in Japan and is  called Usui Shiki Reiki Ryoho. Ushida was the second president of this  organization after Usui made his transition. I recommend the book Reiki  Fire for those interested in the true and verifiable history of Reiki or  contact the Usui Shiki Reiki Ryoho society in Japan. These are only a FEW  examples of the incorrect information this book is presenting about Reiki  and its history 
 I went to Swiss gear website to check out the pole and see if they had any others.  This is the only pole they have which isn't saying much for the brand, but I found that the suggested retail is $4 lower to what Amazon is selling it for.  Just seems like the seller should always be lower or at least the same price.  Even though Amazon is jacking up the price its still really cheap.  Probably too cheap to be any good 
 I normally thoroughly enjoy reading travelogues.  I was looking forward to this book for a week before I found time to read it.  I didn't feel it was worth my time.  I was looking for more information about and feel about the places, and less self-exploration of the authors.  Not bad, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone 
 jargon free!  HA!  That's a good one.  I had to read this for a second year historiography course.  This is an extremely poorly written text which is very difficult to understand.  The authors went out of their way to cloud the arguments in confusing language. I went into the course loving  history.  Now at the end of my second year I am switching majors because I  would have to take a similar course in fourth year.  History itself I love.   Historiography is BORING. Such stupid debates permeate this  discipline.  gender history, oral history,... Forget this nonsence 
 Can't understand anything in this book. It's too confusing and the analysis is horrible. Stay away from all Andrew Martin stuff 
   The advertisement for this item says that it can be used on cats, having a daughter who may or may not have difficulty with dander I was under the impression that this was the answer to those problems.  The description is a "massaging brush" but when one turns it on it sounds almost like a small vacuum cleaner.  As you are able to guess, cats scramble from it like a real vacuum cleaner!  On pure accident, it was knocked onto the ground, about two feet to the floor, and ceased working, so the sound was no longer a problem.  The brush surface disloded as well and I have yet to get it back in place. 
 Being a huge fan of Golden Age mystery fiction and also an admirer of Gypsy Rose Lee, I was very eager to read this book.  I also have the film "Lady of Burlesque" with Barbara Stanwyck, which follows the book fairly closely and which I thorougly enjoy.  However, although Gypsy Rose Lee "stars" in the story which involves murders among the striptease acts in an Opera House, the writing is rather uninvolving and I who read voraciously had trouble staying interested.  I also confess to being rather annoyed at the petty squabbling between the women which fails to capture the friendships that also develop between women.  In fact, the characterizations remain on an extremely superficial level and the few colorful instances (almost "pre-code" sort of moments) do not rescue the story or make it any more compelling.  I found myself bored and wanting to read something else.  It's a pity, because I truly did want to like it and the premise was promising.  My conclusion:  Gypsy Rose Lee was a very beautiful woman and I imagine a powerful and provocative performer with some class to boot, but she is not a great writer by any stretch of the imagination.  Being a great performer or leading a colorful life does not necessarily mean that you can write; writing is a whole other art form and too many people think it requires no particular skill since one is not required to do eye-high kicks or hit high notes.  They're absolutely wrong, as misfires such as this demonstrate (although I've read far worse).    A disappointment, but may fill the bill for someone looking for a light read.  To use an apt cliche:  mediocre fare.  
 Woodrow Call and Agustus McCrae are very young men, just embarking on their adventures as Texas Rangers when this book takes place. I have to admit it was rather a disappointment. "Lonesome Dove" is a masterpiece and, in a way, I think McMurty should have left it at that. He uses the central characters from "Lonesome Dove" in "Dead Man's Walk", and, especially in regard to Woodrow Call, it just doen't ring true. I just can't see Captain Call of LD as the same Woodrow Call in DMW, particularly when it comes to his relationship with Maggie. Captain Call was a solitary individual,emotionally remote. I don't see this struggle in DMW, or any reason for him to turn inward later in life and to deny his son. The ending of the book seems rather abrubt and far-fetched. If you can separate the idea that these are the same characters from LD, you may enjoy the book on that level. As westerns go, it is an okay read 
 I was never able to use this mirror successfully due to its low light source. Agree with other users--this mirror was no better than an unlighted one. 
 The aim of the book is to teach readers about contracts and how to write good ones. The main points are summarized at the start of the book in a series of six guidelines (as described in the review above):  - Separate queries from commands  - Separate basic queries from derived queries  - Write a postcondition for each derived query that specifies what result can be returned  - Write a postcondition for each command that specifies the value of every basic query  - Decide on a suitable precondition for every query and command  - Write invariants to define unchanging properties of objects   This part is well written and provides good advice for people new to writing contracts. The presentation is however very academic with examples based on stacks and dictionaries.  The authors then try to present more realistic examples. Unfortunately that's where they fail badly.   The first example shows how to use contracts to write an observer pattern. The only thing that the authors show is that you can write a contract that makes sure that the observers are properly added to the list of observers. Since most modern languages implement the observer pattern in the language itself (via events), this is a contract that no-one needs to write. The problem that usually happens in real programming is that the events are wired up too early or too late. Contracts provide little help for this. The authors should have chosen an example that better demonstrates the power of contracts.  The second example is an over-extended explanation about how you can write code so that you never call a method when its precondition is false. The explanation is convoluted and offers no real insight into programming by contracts.  The final chapter discusses applying contracts to languages that do not support them natively (basically all languages other than Eiffel). I had high hopes for this chapter. Unfortunately, the authors recommend using a pre-processor (e.g., iContracts) or only implementing preconditions with assertions. Most programmers with a little experience will already be using assertions and will not learn much from the chapter.  The book is a compilation of various papers that the authors published in conferences (mainly TOOLS). The problem is that the material is suited to a 20 page paper not a 200+ page book. Even with repetitions and ample space the lack of useful information is apparent. The second half of the book is a waste of paper.   Contracts are a very useful tool when properly applied. The guidelines presented at the start of the book are very good. Unfortunately the book is marred by a lack of real world examples 
 I liked this movie, but I can't for the life of me tell you why. It features Nicolette Sheridan as "Donna Randal," a wife and mother, who has a brief affair with her daughters teacher while her husband "Jeff," played by Robert Seeliger, is away on assignment. The affair is actually encouraged by her best friend and co-worker "Roz," played by Leni Parker.   Donna is upset because her husband's job as a foreign correspondent keeps him away for extended periods of time, and while on his current assignment he has forgotten to call her on their anniversary. She meets her daughters teacher "Adam," played by Andrew Jackson, who sympathizes with her, and she is quite taken by him. She runs into him at a concert and one thing leads to another and she ends up in his bed for one night.  As it turns out when she gets home and takes a shower to wash off the effects of her adultery, her husband shows up while she is towelling off, and announces that he is home to stay. She doesn't seem to be really overjoyed by the news, taking advantage of his presence to chew him out for past absences, but they do come together when he shows the proper remorse for his past sins of doing his job,(a little sarcasm there). As it rurns out, Adam, the teacher, shows up that night not knowing that Jeff has returned, and after an awkward few monents leaves, pretending to have been concerned about the daughter "Melinda," played by Amanda Tilson. Jeff seems a little suspicious, suggesting to Donna that since he is home and Melissa seems to be OK there will be no need for Adam to pay any more visits.   As the plot develops it turns out that her dalliance with Adam was videotaped and a copy is delivered to her husband at his office. He is understandably upset, and after playing the tape for her he leaves, taking Melinda with him.  After few days she goes to see Jeff to plead for a reconciliation. This is where the movie drops from a "4" to a "3" for me. When he makes it plain that he is through with her and can not forgive her adultery she tries to excuse it by saying she had been angry at his absence, was lonely and upset at his forgetting their anniversary. It seems to me that his reply should have been "so your reaction to being angry with me is to go out and have sex with someone else?" The logical follow-up would be "how many other times have you been angry with me?"  But he passes up that opportunity and the movie progresses to what I consider a  formulaic and predictable conclusion that leaves me mildly dissappointed. All in all it was worth an evenings viewing and Nicollette in a tight tee shirt made it worth watching for me 
 I read and loved Volume 1 of this trilogy and it inspired me to leave my first ever review on Amazon.  What a huge disappointment this book was after the brilliance of A Star Called Henry.  The plot seems to miander aimlessly though Henry's new life in America with the author using every opportunity to offer some hidden meaning to his words through over artsy pros.  It's possible that some deep thinking English majors might like this approach but for me it was dull, difficult to read and monotonous.  If you have read A Star Called Henry, I highly recommend you give this follow-up a miss so as not to spoil your impressions of the story 
 The plot of the story is Ludlum all the way, but the narrative is no where near Ludlum. I am having a hard time getting through it. Will probably give up before half way 
 Mr. Peretti's book often had me close to tears, and I understand why he wrote it.  There are some gems in this book that I loved.  For example, on page 81 he claims, "The message a bully sends is a mockery of God's handiwork, a lie that slanders God's nature and negates His love for us."; this is a quote I will memorize. Another gem starts on page 113 and gives us some clever retorts for those who claim that there is no God and hence, no Moral Law Giver.    Unfortunately, he describes the problems well, but he is very weak on answers.  He urges: "Those being abused speak up and seek help", "The strong kids stand up and protect the weak", "Those in authority to take notice - and action", "Everyone to stop thinking of abuse as `kids being kids'".    As a former victim and bully, as one who has tried to stand up and protect the weak, as one in authority taking notice and attempting action, and as one not thinking of abuse as "kids being kids"; I found nothing I could use in his book.  Bullying is ancient.  Just look at Satan picking on Job or Saul picking on David and you realize that we have been working on this problem for thousands of years.  We've also been trying the same actions Mr. Peretti advocates for thousands of years, and we still have the same problems.  I am a middle school teacher, and I have tremendous problems with bullies in my classes.  I personally tried Mr. Peretti's methods, and I failed to make them work.  It's time to try something new, and there is a method I have used that works for me.  Try reading Izzy Kalman's 'Bullies to Buddies: How to Turn Your Enemies Into Friends' for new and refreshing ideas that work. 
 Wendy Doniger has done a disservice to an important Hindu work. She has misinterpreted the work in important passages.   Poor showing Wendy 
 i wonder if im reading the same book the others are reading. i'm on page 101 right now and it took me about 4 days to get this far. (i've gone through 3 clique books in a day, so it's not like i'm a slow reader) the book is just so boring. its like ive read all of this cr@p before! so far sam had a graduation party at her dad's yacht, we hear about 2 new characters from a rival school who happen to be enemies of sam and her group and conveniently enough the two schools do something together, i forget what but it looks like it will be the opportunity for sam to get her revenge for getting poop smeared on her white jeans a few years back (eye-roll). anna is incapable of taking care of herself at a time of crisis (her car gets rear ended by some cliche white trash woman) so her dad's 'dont judge a book by the cover cliche' tatooed but hot new intern comes to rescue her, omg romance! (another eye roll) ben is being a troll my guess is hes cheating on her, but seriously reading that chapter where they go on this really uncomfortable date just made me want to scream at the book! it was so annoying.  the only thing keeping me reading right now is the cammie storyline, i want her to confront her dad and find out what happened to her mom.  right now im giving the book 2 stars, after i finish the book (if i ever do) ill come back and edit this. if anyone wants to take me out of my misery and tell me what happened to cammies mom, be my guest! lol  ***EDIT*** it got a lot better after page 101, the Sam plot got developed (a bit overdone, tacky and stalkerish, i mean a life size cut out? a 100 cell phones? come on, what a waste of money. she could have donated all that $$$ to some charity in peru and impressed her guy a lot more. the cammie story is getting juicier, and parker may have a bona fide crush on sam. i still think ben is a creep. well i guess i wont spoiler everything lol. i'm still not done yet. ill continue this after i finish.  ***FINAL EDIT*** after a good middle, the book took a nosedive.  the story of cammie's mother was horribly disappointing. i officially HATE ben now and im getting more and more sick of anna for even being into him. what kind of guy tries to make a girl feel weird and uptight for thinking that sex between two people should be special??? that just really turned me off. the girl who wins a contest by wearing nothing but body paint to the party?? okay, this is a book that 12 year olds read, did we seriously need to hear that? the best way to get liked is to get naked?  sigh... the two stars rating stands. sorry 
 It is fiction of course. It can not be otherwise for what it contends may happen is IMPOSSIBLE! Many reviewers are upset. Upset perhaps but they should not be worried. The Church is protected by Christ's promise that it will not err. Any person of faith sees this book as FICTION. It is a poor attempt to disguise Greely's left wing theology as fiction. The message to those liberals who find "hope" for their cause in this book: IT AIN'T GOING TO HAPPEN. Recommended reading: "Women Priests And Other Fantasies" Greely and his followers are delusional 
 ... the subject matter is very intriging and deservesattention. However, Ms. Chang's book has no real insight into Tsien'slife.... The actual writting is also lackingg. The book is filled with dragging sentences that fails to excite the reader. I only recommand this book to readers who do not know anything about Chinese history or Tisen. It is to be used as an general and elementry reference only. Even then, there are still many holes... 
 I'm a big Nora fan, but I couldn't even finish this one. By the fourth chapter I began to skim. WAY WAY WAY to much detail for me. Which made it boring and slow. Testing and corrosion, is it fake, is it real ...blah blah blah. ENOUGH! I did however enjoy the side story about the brother (I forget his name). But thats it folks. Unlike ALL the other reviewers, I hated it. I say PASS on this one. But as you can see, I'm in the minority 
 This should be titled "Blueprint for Ruptured Eardrums".  I am not quite sure why this titled was listed under "Popular Music".  And don't give me any of that "avant garde" nonsense.  If I had zero musical talent, I'd call it "avant garde" so pseudo-intellectuals would think they were supposed to enjoy it, too.  Yoko Ono is music's physical manifestation of the Emperor's New Clothes (only with gigantic blue-blockers) 
 I would easily be able to rip this box open. I refuse to put a 600 dollar hand gun in a piece of garbage like this. Any criminal with a little hand strength could easily get into this box quickly 
 This review is for the Spanish edition ONLY which I recently purchased (ISBN:8498160162, publisher: Linkgua).  Note, that this is an ABRIDGED EDITION (edición abreviada) and is not true to the original text, this is evident commencing with the first sentence of the book. The reader will get the general idea of the novel, but will not read the words as written be the author.  I submit here an example of the above-mentioned sentence:  ABRIDGED EDITION (ISBN 8498160162): A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido vulgarmente con el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que era el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en los demás arrabales y hasta dentro de la ciudad.  ORIGINAL TEXT: A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido popularmente bajo el nombre de Capitán Tiago, daba una cena, que, sin embargo de haberlo anunciado aquella tarde tan sólo, contra su costumbre, era ya el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en otros arrabales y hasta en Intramuros.  This editing is consistent throughout every paragraph in the book.   If you just want a good read, then this edition will suffice. It is an excellent novel. However, if you are an admirer of the Spanish language, please get your hands on the original version.  
 First off Juelz Santana isn't a new rapper.  His first release was From Me To U, and he release several mixtapes but didn't emerge into the spotlight till Cam'ron let him hop aboard on his hits "Oh Boy" and "Hey Ma"  Then he made a huge splash when it came time for his solo joint "There It Go (The Whistle Song)" was very overrated IMO.  That's not to say isnt some good stuff in his sophmore album What The Game's Been Missing that's worth checking out.  "Shottas" featuring Cam'ron and Sizzla is good for dancing too, and even though Sizzla brings a reggae feel to the song it's not anything close to that type of music.  Of course everyone has already heard the anthemic "Mic Check" although for some reason it's censored on here.  There's gotta be a hood song on here of course and "Whatever You Wanna Call It" doesn't fail although Hell Rell fails to impress (not that I thought he would).  "Daddy" shows that Juelz has a soft side talking about what would happen if he lost his kid, and "Gone" is his strongest track lyric wise.  So after naming all those good songs why the low rating?  Well, for starters this album is 76 minutes long, and with 22 tracks 5 songs doesn't cut it.  "Oh Yes" was a guilty pleasure for me, but the chorus worn on me and got annoying after a while.  The same goes for the constant screaming in the chorus on "Murda Murda" featuring Cam'ron.    There's plenty of filler tracks too like the ridiculous "I Am Crack", "Gangsta S**t", and "Rumble Man Rumble".  And I don't know who Juelz thinks he is with his constant screaming (your not in M.O.P.) thorough the skippable "Violence".  Production fails on "Make It Work For You" with the music sounding like it was produced off a keyboard.  It doesnt help that both Young Jeezy and Lil' Wayne outshine him on here too.  And when I heard "Clockwork", I was like "Who wasted their time writing this?"  Juelz Santana shows that he has potential but he just doesn't have what it takes to carry a whole album 
 When the time came to read this year's Halloween book, I chose Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night by Nicholas Rogers. I was looking for an interesting, scholarly treatment of the holiday. I didn't find it.  That's not to say that I didn't learn anything. According to Rogers, Halloween, as it is celebrated in the United States and Canada, was basically brought to the New World by Scottish and Irish immigrants. In those countries, Halloween apparently grew out of Pagan autumn festivals and the Christian holidays of All Saints and All Souls days. The Day of the Dead had a similar origin in Mexico. What began in the US and Canada as a celebration of Celtic pride evolved into a night of teen and adult rowdiness, which was in turn tamed into "trick-or-treating." In the last few decades, the commercial engines have behaved like a positive-feedback loop: Because Halloween is popular, there is money to be made, so it needs to be hyped and marketed to make it more popular, so more money can be made, and so on.  See? That didn't take 170 pages. The remaining space is occupied by the author supporting his conclusions with data and argumentation. The data generally amounts to lists of single sentence anecdotes gleaned from various Canadian and American newspaper editions published in late October and early November over a wide range of years. There are also a number of illustrations, including festive holiday snapshots taken by the author. The author's argumentation is based on induction from these published data points -- as well as stories from his colleagues and dentist -- to explain their significance as only an academic could. For example, this gem is put forth as part of the discussion of the relevance of the Halloween movies by John Carpenter to the actual holiday (p. 121):  "For it could be argued that Myer's murderous interventions are facilitated by the collapse of Halloween as an inclusive family holiday and its transformation into a set of generational consumer rites in which family mutualities are neglected."  What?! The plots of the six Halloween "films" are discussed and their commentary on the holiday is "explored." It is hard to take this kind of scholarship seriously when it takes slasher-flix so seriously 
 DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCTS FROM THE WESLO COMPANY. I just received my "Weslo Cadence C44 Treadmill" and have attempted to assemble it. The handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console. The Customer Service numbers are all disconnected. Their website gives an additional number to call, and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers, or puts you on hold for about 2 minutes before it hangs up on you. I have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them. This company is a complete scam. If you are even considering buying one of their products, your money is better spent getting your head checked 
 you'd be much better off to buy other volumes in the series.  This two-volume anthology is generally a two-thousand page waste of time.  Most poetry is consigned to oblivion for a reason!  What is here rescued is frankly not worth it, and the "literature" here is of historical  rather than intrinsic interest.  A monument to "inclusivity" and  "diversity," but full of poor writing, the Common Reader is here  advised to invest in Library of America's wonderful volumes of the poetry  of Frost, Stevens, Whitman, and, whenever they finally appear in the  future, Dickinson, Melville, Eliot, and Bishop 
 I had bought this for a friend/co-worker as I would never purchase something so lame for myself, plus I am not into these stupid types of lame movies.  People who like this movie probably liked Breakin', Honey and La Bamba. OKay so La Bamba was actually a decent movie.  Anyway, just like all the other reviewers had already stated, this album is missing the better songs from the movie apparently.  If you really want the songs from the movie you might be better off holding a tape recorder to your tv next time the movie is on 
 Now obviously the new rap music and great american voices they put on make it as bad as possible.  But then again, the movie certainly is no gem in it's original language version, that is for sure.    The whole movie had above average action sequences, but the story was unbearable.  Not the story itself, but the execution of it is the worst possible.  It goes from sickening moments to almost little kid parts between Jet and teh girl.  Just freaking horrible.    So the dvd is full screened, music is stupid, voice dubbing is almost as bad as the "jet li collection" movies, but you will get a few good points one or two good laughs, and a decent finale.  
 A bottle of Tarn-X worked so much better and faster.    Just use scratch-free sponges for general cleaning, and when the copper gets dingy a damp cloth of Tarn-X worked in about 10 seconds.  This cleaner kept my elbows greasy for at least 20 minutes a pot.  It DOES work... but be prepared to scrub - at about twice as much as regular copper cleaner works 
 Picked these up last night and they really sound bad. There seems to be a lot of artifacts in the sound from the digital signal processing. Also, they recommend you not separate the speakers by more than 24".  That's hard with a large monitor.  The quality of materials is top notch though.  I expected allot better sound quality from Bose, especially considering the price.  Listening to one of my favorite CDs for about five minutes over them actually made me nauseous.  I returned them to the store this morning for a full refund.      
 I'm an avid reader who takes pleasure in spending (too much) money on books.  Catherine Coulter, being that she's one of my favorite authors, takes up a large amount of space in my book cabinet along with Julie Garwood, Tami Hoag, and Patricia Cornwell.  However, I've noticed Ms. Coulter's losing a bit of her pizzaz when it comes to her more recent works.  Before I read this book, although in honesty, I have yet to finish it, I was elated upon seeing that it would soon be in stores.  I went to her website each and every day for the longest time, in hope that she'd post a preview as she always does.  When I read about Ruth's adventure, I was excited and determined to purchase the book with all haste.  Especially after witnessing the panic she was feeling.  However, once I'd begun reading Point Blank, I realized she'd put everything she had into a powerful beginning and not so much into the rising action.  To say in the least, I'm disappointed.  I'm currently stuck, for lack of a better word, on chapter twenty-one because I've been straying from reading this book.  Instead, I've enveloped myself in the wonderfully written novels Julie Garwood has provided.  I hate admitting the fact that although Coulter started out as my favorite author with novels such as The Maze, The Edge, Riptide, Eleventh Hour, Blindside, and Blowout, Julie Garwood is beginning to pull ahead with her brilliant works.    The dialogue in this book is so forced, along with the jokes and relationships.  I took a bit of a peek ahead and witnessed a kiss between Ruth and Dix that was both expected yet unexpected.  You see, he kissed her in a rather awkward moment.  The dog had just wet himself (and her borrowed leather jacket) when Dix decides this is the time to kiss her.  I'm sorry, but who does that?  There was no indication, from what I saw, at that moment to suggest he even desired kissing her.  Yes, it's bound to happen eventually- the two of them realizing they care about each other.  But at such an awkward time?  With no warning or no hint of what he'd been thinking or seeing?  It was certainly a moment I'd like to forget because it's one of the worst moments she's written thus far between two characters.  Yes, the dialogue is indeed forced, as are the relationships, jokes, and laughter.  I don't understand exactly what happened to my favorite author, but I sense this is perhaps a foreshadowing of the worst.  
 While yes, it is almost universally accepted that other, former, religions "shaped the Christian world". That would be a grave error, to say that it continues to shape it. Almost as grave as mistaking early Christian practices with the modern day Church. The Mysteries of Mithras, was in my opinion both fascinating and frightning. I was fascinated to learn about such a ancient and complex religion but on the other hand, it was recommended to me by a friend, who I will call Nrob. He has it in his head that Mithras was THE foundation of Christian law when it was many things and some even unique that came to form the power house religion of the modern world 
 this is storie from a time as a wanderer. some of it is a interesting read, some of it not. all in all it's like images, and the reader doesn't get too involved. L has never been famous for writing from a biographical point of view, and it's not surprising. i was charmed by some of the scenes, but on the whole it was not such an interesting rea 
 This is a bad book.  The print is in small font.  The book is cryptic to follow.  I only read the first few chapters than I had to stop.  I did not like this book 
 I received this unit as a gift.  Rechargeable batteries work well for my portable electronics and I thought this 15-minute charger would be a huge improvement over the overnight charger I own.  It wasn't.  Like others leaving comments here, I found that this charger rejects many batteries I put in it with its annoying flashing red light -- including brand new NiMh batteries.  All of my batteries rejected by this charger worked just find in my overnight charger.    I threw this charger in the trash where it belongs 
 Given the nature of things online and how easy it is to misrepresent something as being *THE GREATEST EVER*, I am usually skeptical when any book has glowing reviews and it's only been out less than a month.  I hate to burst the shiny bubble that the other two reviewers have given but Christopher Hart's books are not worth the time or the money for the serious would-be comic book artist or established artist looking to improve.  Don't just take my word for it though go to your local library or bookstore and have a look at Hart's books yourself.  In all of his books on superhero drawing and manga style drawing, you will find no more than 25 pages of artwork done by Hart.  This book I believe only has 16 - 18 pages of art attributed to him out of 144 pages.    So exactly who fills out the rest of Hart's books?  A number of other artists who draw considerably better superheroes and villains in American, Manga and Fusion style than Hart can.  It's a shame those artists don't have their names listed on the book covers.  To even put Hart's name on the cover as though he'd done all the work (or even most of it) is very misleading.  Again, don't just take my word for it, visit your library or bookstore and look for the contributing artists listed in the first few pages of the book.  You will quickly find that Hart is good at drawing very basic and general characters but not the type of superheroes that populate comic books.    Now you might think well if the other artists are pretty good isn't the book still worth it?  No and the reason I say this is because I've seen them and most every one is light on technique and instruction. How light? Try a page or two at best on topics like facial expressions, poses, clothing etc.  There are better books out there which are more in depth and devoted to one or two topics rather than skimming over many as Hart's books do.  I can only guess that the popularity of comic books, comic books turned movies and videogames based on comics has served to fuel the book buying of how-to drawing books that have made Hart a best-seller.  It's also served to prompt many others to toss crappy how-to draw books out there as well.  Sadly, there's at least three worthless drawing books for every solid book on comic book/superhero drawing.  With the string of Hart books coming out seemingly one after another, that ratio of bad over good will only continue to grow.    I just hope that more people discover the truth about books like this one and not buy them sight unseen based on the sales rank or number of glowing reviews. Hopefully the result will be fewer sales and ultimately fewer useless books clogging up the market. 
 In the user manual there is a whole list of people who it will provide inaccurate body fat percentage measurements for and body builders are one of them. I wish I had known this before. Now I have to waste about $20 in shipping to return it.  DO NOT BUY FOR BODY FAT MEASUREMENT 
 There are some good pieces of psychological information in this book that could asssit in rounding out an already developed character. Also, if your character matches perfectly to one of the character types in this text, then you can be assured that you have a stereotype, which is good to know. The explanation of motivation for certain crimes is also informational and fairly intuitive.  Overall, the information is simplistic and incomplete even given the limited parameters of printed information(in the murder section, murder to specifically advance goals or cover a problem is not mentioned.) I found myself often saying, "but what about..."  While it is true that one cannot cover every piece of information in a given subject area, the reader should not be left guessing about the omission of information.  There was a particular page in the book that really got under my skin as a psychologist and a woman. Her explanation of how "we" see heroism as adventure-seeking and risk taking (and "we're" wrong!) She goes on to explain how to define heroism (a good definition) and how once we do that, women outnumber men in the number of heroes.  It demonstrates a subtle theme running throughout the text that got under my skin.  She assumes an attitude is widespread (poor definition of hero;) and that women are better (once we redefine, women outperform men.)  I shall keep this on my reference shelf for occasional perusal.  
 This book went right off tangent, after the brilliant writing that started the series.  The side-story is pretty bland, doesn't provide insight so much as it rewrites the backstory, and the overall plot isn't expanded, it sounds like he mostly ran out of ideas and started to drag his other books into the story. 
 I love del Toro's movies, but this was a major disappointment. Apart from a few nice visuals, this film has no redeeming quality. Every scene is predictable, badly acted, badly filmed, and not even remotely scary.  Furthermore, this movie features possibly the worst child actor in history of the world cinema. I'd imagine that a young girl (5? 6?) who's just seen her grandpa come back from the dead looking like a corpse would be freaking out, or show at least SOME sort of emotion. This child's face and body language were only a tad more alive than a plastic manequin, including the scene where she splits a man's skull open with a walking stick. For me, that drove the final nail into the coffin of this movie.  Skip this one, and see The Devil's Backbone instead 
 After seeing the real show in L.A., my girlfriend and I were really looking forward to the DVD.  And after last night's viewing, I went to bed kinda creeped out and actually felt a little guilty that I didn't like the whole thing that much.  I'm relieved to see that other fans just couldn't handle all the audience shots either.  This DVD tries so hard to define Paul's place in our lives and his impact on the world through his music that it ends up blowing it for those of us who already know, feel, and live it.  They tried to document his music and its impact instead of just filming it.  If you're from Mars and this is your first day on Earth, you might appreciate the way the DVD attempts to explain the relevance of Paul's work.  If you've been on this planet for awhile, chances are you're already up to speed and just want to see the band and hear the music 
 I bought this vacuum as a cheap "in between" vacuum while I saved up to get a better one.  It did a pretty good job cleaning my small apartment for about a month.  It has a nice LED which tells you when you need to clean the cup and filter. This is also, unfortunently, when the vacuums suction has dwindled to nill.  This happens often.  After a few minutes of medium to heavy cleaning, the whole thing needs to be cleaned, otherwise your just pushing the thing back and forth for show.  After about a month, this condition became permanent.  The light stayed on, and the vacuum was basically useless.  I hesitate to give this product one star, because it would probably be good for small jobs and light cleaning.  Just don't buy it and expect it to be your primary vacuum 
 I watched this movie all the way through only because I paid $22.00 plus shipping and felt I should give it every chance to redeem itself. It is a stinker and if there were minus number ratings I would give it -10!! Rated "R" for what? Language? Adult content? I have seen Disney films more deserving of the "R" rating. This movie was silly, definitely not entertaining in any way and I threw it in the same bucket I put my dog's crap in when I clean up the yard. I am a Chris Isaak fan, have all his CDs and went to his concert on December 9. The fact that he would associate himself with this garbage has changed my view of him and unfortunately, even his music. I did not find the film offensive, I enjoy hard core porn. I feel this is a rip off, poorly done in all aspects and highly do not recommend it to anyone!!! 
 This is just a PR piece for the Disney company, a way to build hype so more people will buy their products and see their shows.  I was hoping for some nuts & bolts advice on designing theme parks and theme park rides.  Everybody knows how to brainstorm;  everybody knows the importance of color and lighting and music;  everybody models on computers before they make physical models.  What do Imagineers do that's different?  Do they have special techniques for brainstorming, or for choosing colors, or stage lighting?  The answers are not here.  Also, what have Imagineers learned from their mistakes?  If you take this book at face value, Imagineers have never made mistakes;  everything they've done is perfect, and any criticism leveled at Walt Disney world was later retracted or countered 
 Pity Mr. Diamond should have chosen precisely such an important matter to ride the wave of his Pullitzer for a hasty cash harvest. I can see why he did, it is such a popular subject nowadays that it just couldn't fail to yield bountifully but we, the people on this sorry spinning ball, deserved better. Yet another wasted chance to pass this important message through.   Disappointment is generously served in various flavors in this book. You get a cold platter of the plain kind of the stuff from the patchy approach (yes, very common indeed in this field, but then, I was expecting more from such an acclaimed author) Then a basket of letdown with the shallow and wrong economic reasoning it uses, a cup full to the rim of frustration with the wrong historical data (Valencia in Spain a place of ancestral small sustainable communities of irrigating farmers????? yeah, right, it must be the golf course mowers... who pay for water a tenth of its transport cost, let alone market or environmental costs!), mousse of emptiness at the nonexistent but thoroughly anticipated chapter on welfare economics... and a bitter dessert made with this yet another failure to pass the important message it promised.   Most certainly, the problem must have not been lack of importance of the matter. To promise enlightenment and not deliver is a hefty responsibility when one chooses to delve on such an important subject.   Shame on Mr. Diamond for this. Maybe he was not read when small a tale about a boy who cried wolf. It wouldn't surprise me, considering the lack of literary education he shows.. 
 A catalyst for the civil war, Uncle Tom's Cabin gives vivid details on the living conditions of the black slaves. The book's literary worth lies in the fact that people can make a difference by speaking out, and by preserving a kind of fictional history of the African American's pain, despite being redundant, rube and rife with tautology. The story is about Tom, a slave who saves his master's daughter and is promised his freedom. But his master dies before Tom is actually freed. The family falls upon hard times and Tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named Simon Legree. Legree tried everything to degrade Tom, but Tom holds firmly to his religious convictions. 
 Like other reviewers listed here, I thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half-a-century old (if not older)using pithy, witty humor and comparisons of the writer's life and Child's life.  To be fair, there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book, but as an avid cook and Child fan I wish there had been more.  I think there is a market today for food writing; good food writing, like MFK Fisher and Elizabeth David, but I don't think Julie Powell even comes close.  The Julie/Julia Project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated (to whatever extent) in some very profound experiences, like working for the government agency dealing with the World Trade Center memorials, a household move in NYC, dealing with a less than stellar marraige, and coping with very needy friends and family.  Julie, get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write!  Forget the food, it's just not you.  Stick to your hoo-hum job, your even more narcissistic friends, and your boring marraige and you could be the next Nora Ephron, or at the very least, Erma Bombeck. 
 This book is long on formula derivation, and short on DOE theory.  It does not introduce readers to DOE software packages like it claims either.    Also, very poor on real life examples.  They exist....but not enough details in order to understand them.  I am looking to teach a corporate class on this....too bad the book doesn't come with the professor.  
 This book was too predicatable, I could see the plot coming miles ahead. A big dumb tough guy goes up against a bunch of bad guys and cops, and he doesn't even have a gun, all he has is his muscles and a strong tolerance for pain. You knew Goldie would turn out to be a hooker, and if that's a spoiler for you. You need to read more fiction and/or watch more sopa operas. The characters aren't that complex, rather two-dimensional and to make matters worse, Miller doesn't even give a twist in the plot. For the record, there have been a number of people who claim to work for God that has done evil deeds for there own selfish purposes. The Crusades for one. So, Miller you don't get any points from me on that one. Now for those of you that are saying. "Hey it's only a comic book, a big one but a comic nonetheless." I say, "That is BULLL!!" Read: watchmen, The Judas Contract, Future Imperfect, and The League part one and two. Oh and Elfquest and then tell me if a comic book can't be well, this no story piece of crap 
 This book pales in comparison to the Trish and Chris Meyer books (Creating Motion Graphics with After Effects). The tutorials are redundant and don't go beyond very basic concepts. I teach After Effects at a local college, and will not be recommending this book to my students 
 Yeah...this book basically seems to follow Dan Browne's to the letter. I had to laugh at another review of it, especially this line: "This is the only [commentary on The Da Vinci Code] written from a balanced, secular point of view."  As if a secular point of view is any less biased regarding God/religion than a religious one is. Hilarious.  If you want to know more, go for the Tony Robinson series on the Real Da Vinci Code, especially when he wants to excavate under the church. Brilliant stuff 
 These are NOT the original recordings.  They're not bad recordings.....just not the originals! 
 I can see how some readers might be put off by all of the science and detail in this book, though I was personally not bothered by it.  There were several things that did trouble me however: 1.) The abrupt switch in the third section from first person to third person.  I felt separated from the characters, especially Claire, and more or less ceased to care about her.  Her behavior on the expedition didn't feel like the person that was established in the first two-thirds of the book, either.  2.) The many parallels between Magda and Claire felt a little contrived.  Her quest to trace her family's history was compelling in and of itself, and didn't need to have those "clairvoyant" elements. 3.) The Ripper subplot was pointless and uninteresting.  For a truly fascinating real theory about the Ripper murders, read Alan Moore's From Hell.   4.) Absolutely no resolution on what happened to Nick and Christian. 5.) The Jack-Claire affair was just creepy. 
 First off, how in Hades does a trifle like this manage to get a blurb from Bill "der Schlickmeister" Clinton, Al "dropped out or thrown out of law school" Gore, and Christpher "Ted Kennedy's henchman" Dodd? Plus, sort of a forward by Elie Wiesel! I thought the book would be in the spirit of Lifton's book on Nazi Doctors, etc., but it is not. Its the story of a 21 or 22 year old court reporter who went over in 1946 to take down testimony at the Nazi Doctor's trials. Ms. Spitz, who I am sure is a very nice lady, learned all the right lessons from the trials and says all the right things. But she is sure no historian, or even a professional writer. She gives absolutely no insight into any of the men charged in the crimes, and is extremely disjointed about what she tells the reader about the trials. Sometimes she quotes the transcripts at some length, sometimes there is almost no discussion of a certain gruesome experiment. The big question, what the Hell were these guys thinking, is completely untouched. In addition, Ms. Spitz's knowledge of WWII is almost nil, and she seems to know little of the first Nuremburg trial. For example, she implies that Goering hid a cyanide capsule in his mouth (the whole time), while we now know that it is likely that an American guard (unwittingly?) smuggled the ampule to him. The quotes from the transcripts are often gripping & harrowing, but that is a credit to the trials, not to the author. Really, the only thing interesting in the book by way of the author is her discussion about living arrangements in 1946 Nuremberg, and the fact that in 1947-1948 there were still pro-Nazi terrorists. Do not spend $24 on this book (or the $16 it cost me) if you are expecting a professional discussion of the Nazi medical experiments. Its worth maybe $2 as a fast read by someone of average intelligence who was at the trials of the sicko Nazi physicians.   
 Some books, in my opinion, are just plain overrated.  The characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting.  Likewise the tale.  The reader takes nothing from it. Put this in a list with Franzen's The Corrections and Frazier's Cold Mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades 
  There's a saying: "No one sets out to make a bad movie."  BROTHERS GRIMM (Miramax) might prove otherwise.  Near the beginning of his commentary, the usually brilliant Terry Gilliam actually says, "I didn't like the script, but I was out of work."  Not a good sign but an honest admission from the former Python.  Although wonderfully visualized, the Czech locations can't make-up for the muddled mess of a screenplay culled from perhaps the richest mother lode of raw story material available anywhere: The collected fairy tales of Wilhem and Jacob Grimm.    In spite of stars Heath Ledger and Matt Damon as con artist exorcists who encounter real evil, a great poster and an OK trailer, audiences rightfully stayed away via quick word of mouth ("incomprehensible" "unwatchable"). Worthy extras of interest mainly to budding filmmakers are Gilliam's commentary and the featurette: "The Visual Magic of the Brothers Grimm. 
 To "Hinkle Goldfarb's" review, I would like to add several observations. Alterman claims that the drop in viewership of the network news was due to the rise in cable news and the dividing up of the same audience among more channels, and not to any liberal bias. He leaves unanswered the question why a significant number of viewers would shift from network to cable. Could it be that the interviewers at Fox, for example, were asking questions that network reporters were not? I also picked up on Alterman's assertion that the MSM's inclusion of conservatives is proof they are not liberal. William F. Buckley's "Firing Line" was considered conservative, but virtually 50% of the time was given to liberal guests to express their views, especially in the formal debates. Fox's Special Report With Brit Hume has Maura Liason (a reasonable liberal) and the ridiculously insufferable Juan Williams (both of PBS), but is also considered by Alterman to be a conservative program. I was completely floored by his statement that Cokie Roberts of ABC is a conservative! Bottom line on this book is the same liberal attitude: liberals are moderate; conservatives are extreme rightists. 
 Lakoff and Nunez state: "Mathematics is not built into the universe. The portrait of mathematics has a human face."       Contrary to these authors' relativistic postmodern point of view, given all the objective and repeatable tests to which mathematical ideas have been put over at least the last 2,500 years, it is clear that the natural world, indeed the universe at large, is remarkably in agreement with many if not most of those ideas that have withstood much testing.        Summarizing their point of view, one might possibly sum up their argument as follows:  *	 Ideas of mathematics originate in the minds of mathematicians; *	 Ideas of mathematics arise via conceptual metaphor; *	 Conceptual metaphor is a mechanism for projecting "embodied reasoning" to abstract reasoning; *	Therefore abstract ideas of mathematics are all metaphor. And: *	Mathematical ideas are not "built into" the universe, but are"embodied" in brains and bodies of persons.     On its face, this is an argument based upon the genetic fallacy, wholesale fallacious reductionism and category error, along with a great deal of ambiguity and equivocation, among other things. It is a relativistic postmodern view born of nominalism and conceptualism.       Any argument against this postmodern view could cite the above fact that mathematical ideas, theorems, concepts have been objectively and repeatedly tested, both in abstract problems as well as in applied empirical problems in demanding fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering sciences, among others. One could note that mathematical ideas, just like ideas and concepts of any other hard-core discipline, (physics immediately comes to mind), must "test out" in the world.        There is not only a consistency and a coherence requirement that mathematical arguments and assertions, concepts, ideas, and theorems must meet; there is also a pragmatic requirement for mathematical concepts and ideas. Moreover, these ideas, concepts, theorems, and principles not only get tested out in mathematics proper. As noted, they also get tested out in other disciplines as well.        Mathematical ideas, concepts, theorems, and principles are fruitfully utilized in all serious research and all knowledge-generating disciplines in the world. Indeed, it is mathematics that gives form to all our knowledge of the world because it gives form to laws and law-like statements.       It is difficult to make sense of the notion of "embodied mathematics." It is not clear that Lakoff and Nunez mean anything other than that the discipline of mathematics, just as all other disciplines of any kind, originates from persons who occupy bodies.        One is almost astonished with such a line of argument. But even though individual persons who are mathematicians may be the originating source for mathematical ideas, those ideas do not remain there. Their objectivity is found in the formal expression and the objective tests to which these ideas have been subjected, sometimes over millennia.        Mathematical concepts, theorems, and principles are not identified, except usually for historical purposes, with those persons who may have conceived of or discovered them. The ideas are certainly not identical with some "embodiment" either in the persons who discovered or conceived of them or those who may come to know them.  Myrna Estep, Ph.D.  
 This movie was so stupid, everyone listens to Nina when she is clearly messing with their lives. They are stupid enough to believe her, and well I don't even know what else happens cause I saved myself and changed the channel 
 I really wanted to like this novel.  It had a clever name, an amalgamation of the Great Schism that separate Catholicism and Protestantism, and Matrix, like the movie with the same title.  (Note: the novel is pronounced Shiz-mat-rix, with a short a, rhymes with schematics).  A classic cyberpunk title.  However, this novel is anything but user-friendly.  I don't know if pharmaceuticals are needed for appreciating this novel, or if the author used them when frantically writing, in between vacuuming the roof of his house and such.  The novel moves at such a frantic pace that within one sentence the entire setting can change and this happens more than a few times.  It's difficult to know the point of the plot; perhaps that life is worth living.  The novel is a cross between Heinlein's Time Enough For Love, Bester's The Stars My Destination, and petting a sea urchin.  In a shocking act of consideration, the publishers have included all of Sterling stories related to the Shaper-Mechanist War.  That would be the full length novel, plus five stories.  The stories were written before the novel, which was the order I read them in, although after reading the novel last, I can't say whether or not to recommend reading in that order.  The stories are interesting and enjoyable.  In fact Sterling seems to excel with his short stories.  His story "Flowers of Edo" is where I got interested in his style.  I would recommend his short stories, but this novel is another matter.  Humanity has balkanized into a number of factions, with the Shapers and Mechanists being the most powerful.  The Shapers have reshaped their bodies genetically.  This includes such drastic things as replacing all the E. Coli in their intestines with enzymes.  The Mechanists are like the Borg of Star Trek, they use mechanical prosthetics to enhance themselves.  If you think the Mechanists are the cleaner of the two, think again.  Cockroaches and bacteria are prevalent in Mechanist environments.  Every five years the Mechanists need to have the bacterial growth scraped and UV-burned off their skin.  That's one thing prevalent throughout his writings, this sort of creepiness.  Expect more of it.  However, don't let the war make you think this is some majestic good vs. evil epic space war.  Battles are mostly low key.  There is lot's of narration and dialog.  Sterling self-claims his crammed prose.  No kidding.  Adjectives rule supreme in this novel; as many as possible are crammed into each sentence.  If one would do a histogram of adjectives, this novel would be on the far right tail of the bell curve.  Here's an excerpt: " He always wore his spacesuit, [something something], and [multiple length modifiers] body odor came through its [multiple adjectives] collar with [multiple adjectives] pungency."  Sentences like this go on and on and on and on and on and on and on throughout the novel.  And there's no shortage of hyphenated words, like long-fermented, eye-watering.  On one page, there were no less than 11 hyphenated words, plus one triple one.  Similar to the prosthetics of the Borg, the sentences themselves seem interchangeable.  Here's another excerpt of a dialogue: "What was your brigade? I'm no Cataclyst. I have your weapon here. Constantine pulled a ... vial from his ... jacket ..." You may as well interchange your own sentences: `The tree fell in the forest; it made no sound' or `the space ship went into orbit; it's boots were muddy.'  Give it a try. It'll make as much sense.  There are times when the novel seems profound.  I would find myself backtracking at times to understand some point, and I would go back 5, then 10, then 20 pages to try to understand something and would just give up and go back to where I was.  It's hard to say you read this novel, it's more like your eyes glance over the words, and on occasion you absorb some of it.  Since the novel fluctuates from the profound to the mundane an average of 2-1/2 stars seemed appropriate 
 My 5 and 3 year olds didn't seem to be too troubled by this book, but I found it dark and disturbing.  What starts out as a seemingly typical children's story takes a sudden and scary turn.  I have to think that the only reason they weren't more scared is that they are too young to know anything about World War II and the death camps.  But even without that metaphor, the illustrations are disturbing in themselves.  Skulls, razor wire, dark figures... it's just not what I consider appropriate for a children's book.  The "magic pencil" story could easily have been told with less threatening villians and more age-appropriate illustrations.  I found myself searching the book's dust jacket for why on earth the author would choose to create a book like this for young children 
 After doing this film Steve Martin quit doing movies for a while and even turned down scripts written for him so if your a huge fan you may enjoy it, but Roxanne, LA Story, and Bowfinger are some of Steve's best works.  
 This book is best left on the shelf, or at least check it out at the library first, if you want to buy it. The language is outdated and it is a dry read. one of the few books I have never finished. There are several better books on doulas and labor support. Ones that are written with a much more modern view 
 We bought this item, because we could not find what we were looking for anywhere else. We had it about 3 weeks and the piece that holds the nipples/caps broke off and now everytime we go to set bottles on it, we have to attach it back on. Not very durable. 
 This has the hit "Talk Talk", and than a bunch of boring tracks which follow it. I am a massive garage rock fan, being in love with both the Sonics and the Monks. However, these guys just don't have the rawness that is required to make a truly great garage rock band. The covers are pretty below average, which is surprising. A good garage band like the Sonics manages to improve on the originals. Good thing I didn't buy this, I just borrowed it from a freind of mine. Really not what the sounds of the garage are like, these guys are just too repetitive. It sort of makes me wonder why they are considored to be one of the genre's best bands. Not really worth owning unless you are a diehard 
 I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life 
  I enjoyed this movie. I orginially saw this move 30 years ago and it brought back some good memories from the seventies. I wouldn't really call it a porn movie. It's more of a movie with adult humor. I'd give it an "R" rating compared to some of the stuff that is available today 
 Okay, I made that mistake and read the Prydain Chronicles before actually seeing this movie. Honestly I didn't think Disney did a good job on this film. Characters were left out and I didn't like how they merged "The Book of Three" and the "Black Cauldron" together. They changed some of the events a bit which didn't make sense to me and the movie seemed rushed, especially when it came to finding the black cauldron. I think this film would of done better as a live action movie, such as Disney's sucsessful "Narnia". And it could have been done in parts, since the Prydain Chronicles by Lloyd Alexandre consists of 5 books. 6 including "The foundling". Another thing I didn't like was that the movie was too dark, too scary for children to enjoy.   I think I would of enjoyed the film more if I have never read the books. X 
 The bed is not as good as it was promised .  The mattress supports dont stay in the side rail like they are supposed to.  Had to use some southern rigging on the bed to keep it together.  The child roll out barriers need to be bolted at both ends instead of one end 
 I hate to be yet another naysayer here, but seriously....what is all the hype about these books? My poor sister (who for some reason loved them) told me to read them, and I struggled for WEEKS to finish the first book in the series. Normally, a book of Eragon's size and reading level would be devoured by me in less that a day or two. However, upon reading the first chapter, I was struck almost immediately by the choppy sentence structure. Almost all the sentence were the same length. It was hard for me to read more than a chapter at a time because passages simply did not flow well at all.   When I finally finished Eragon, I thought that the second one had to be better, since it got published. I was dead wrong. Both books had an incredibly boring story, derivative plot, unoriginal characters and setting (also names stolen almost directly from Tolkien!!  ), pedestrian language and writing style, wooden dialogue (every character spoke with the same exact "voice," none were really distinct from each other), and cliched expression after cliched expression. In Eragon at least, the entire book was full of passages of "purple prose." Worst of all, the author only TOLD and hardly ever SHOWED the reader what the characters were feeling. Speaking of characters, Eragon sorely lacked both character description (I didn't even know what Murtagh was supposed to look like or how old he was until the book was almost over), and there was almost no character development whatsoever. I felt no emotional involvement and didn't care a thing for almost any of the characters. Making the reader care about their characters is one of the most important things authors must do to create a meaningful story with emotional depth. For instance, if George R. R. Martin can make me learn to love a traitorous villain who commits incest with his sister, then why can't I care about the "perfect" titular HERO of these books???    Believe me, I gave this series many chances to impress....and it failed. I love the idea of Dragon Riders (a la the Pern series) and I thought the character of Saphira had some good things about her. Being a linguist, I love the idea of language having a deep, abiding power of its own (which has also been done a la Tolkien and Le Guinn), but the things in this story just felt like a boy's fantasy daydream, down to the sexy elf chick in tight leather of all things.  Just because someone is young and writes a novel does not make said novel good nor does it make said novelist a prodigy. I truly think that the only reason either of these books were published in the first place is because Paolini's parents were the ones who published them.   My apologies if my rant offends anyone, I'm just a little upset that I spent so long plodding through this only to find that it did not improve. Normally when I read a book, I can tell its good because of the shivers of excitement I feel while devouring page after page. That quality is the main thing that was missing from Paolini's works. I truly hope he has a chance to improve his writing over time.  
 A big help to me in my game . The biggest help i got from another of rotellas books directly with putting and as a result i have never seen so many birdies in a round due directly to the said two books 
 I haven't read many of her newer books but I saw this one in paperback and grabbed it.  So disappointing!! The plot was formulaic and the continual, random introduction of a new character without explaining fully their significance was extremely annoying and confusing.  I forced myself to read this book thinking that eventually it would hook me; it never did.  I usually inhale good books (read in a couple days, a week max) but this one took me three weeks to read. The ending "twist " seemed forcibly abrupt and unbelievable.  MHC is/was a great author, but I'd recommend sticking with her older books 
 Steve Coogan steals kids toys and soils them with his X Ray eyes. Knowing Me Knowing You is nowhere near as funny as his Alan Partridge sitcom or the Day Today. David Schneider and Patrick Marner deserve better than this. Eat my GOOAAAL 
 My wife and I received this vacuum as a wedding gift. Before we even celebrated our 2 year anniversary, the vacuum had completely fallen apart. It won't stand up on its own, 2 screws have fallen out of the base, the house smells like burnt rubber every time we use it, I have to use the attachments to suck up anything bigger than a cat hair, and the plastic guard on the front is completely detached. Furthermore, everytime we vaccum, the HEPA filter trap opens, and I have to put it back together before I can resume. After reading other reviews, I'm glad I'm not the only one whose had these problems. I didn't pay for the thing, but if you're planning on it, my suggestion is DON'T BUY THIS VACUUM. You'll be shopping for another one within 2 years just like me. 
 Extemely thoroughly researched, but author has gone astray with his novel, burdening the narrative with extraneous detail and long digressions that have nothing to do with the plot, which is convoluted and unconvincing. Characterization is weak,and, overall, the author seems to have ventured too far afield from his own expertise. That is, he seems to lack most of the tools of good fiction writing. Astonishing that the publisher seems to have put a fair amount of money behind pushing this book. 
 Complete waste of time!  I am done reading Robin Cook books for now..The story line for this book is so stupid I am amazed Mr. Cooks editors even allowed it to be printed..I'm not sure about the hospitals where Robin lives or works at, but in the area where I live, if just one patient died there would be an immediate investigation, but here we have several patients die from unknown causes and the characters just move along like it's no big deal..The Wilsons even allow their daughter to be admitted!!!  Give me a break!!  Like I said..don't waste your time on this one!!  
 Movie: *1/2  DVD Quality: ****  DVD Extras: ***  Don't be fooled by the pedigrees of the distinguished cast and crew members; "In Dreams" is without doubt THE career low for director/screenwriter Neil Jordan as well as actors Annette Bening, Aidan Quinn, Stephen Rea, and even Robert Downey, Jr. (who's made a handful of turkeys throughout his rollercoaster career).  The film aspires to be a psychological mystery-suspense-thriller in the vein of "Psycho" and "The Silence of the Lambs", but is completely undone by a cut-and-paste script filled with unlikeable and unbelievable characters; uninspired direction; shallow performances; choppy editing; and a grossly ineffective musical score.  Only one scene in the movie is played convincingly, and that's the one in which Annette Bening finally begins to go over the edge mentally; pitching her voice in a lower tone and undergoing swift changes of emotion, Bening gives a brief and tantalizing glimpse of what she might have been able to achieve with a similar character in a better movie.  Unfortunately, that one scene does not make the chore of sitting through the other 97 minutes of pretention and tedium worthwhile.  In terms of technical quality, the DVD presentation of this bomb is more than acceptable.  Picture quality is clear and sharp; the sound is a bit fuzzy in one or two spots, but that may have been the intent of the filmmakers - I was so bored and so eager for the movie to be over that I didn't stop to replay the bits of dialogue in question.  The DVD extras are so-so: thumbnail cast and crew Biographies that mention much better movies; several lackluster screens filled with "Production Notes"; and finally, the Theatrical Trailer, which is probably the best thing on the disc because it's short and features quick flashes of the film's visual highlights.  "In Dreams" is not recommended viewing, even for those viewers who enjoy bad movies for their camp value 
 This book is a boring waste of time.  I hated it, and that is very rare for me.  So much of the book seems to be just filler.  Roland makes connections without foundation between events.  He thinks about what has happened, and decides that certain events are related.  He is right, of course, but it does not flow.  Alchemy is a foolish excuse for a book.  Reading it, it seems as if the author is fighting to make a half-way decent story so she can publish a book.  If only she had realized what a piece of garbage this is before sending it to the publisher 
 Leonardo's Laptop Response:  I really dislike this book.  At first, I was looking forward to reading it.   I am very interested in technology's future, human computer interface design, and enabling better software through simplicity.  The combination of technology and artistry suggested by the title led me to believe that it would be an insightful volume pointing the way to a better computing.  Instead, this diatribe leads me only left with a feeling that the author is so full of himself as to be blind to the world around him.  This book does address real issues.  As computing moves from the back server closet into the home, real changes have to be made.  Software today is complicated, and is frequently frustrating to use and learn.  However, this author acts as if the computing world is ignorant of the cost of complexity.  His book falls short of actual ways to achieve these goals, has no recognition of the technological, economical, or social challenges involved, and totally fails to recognize the work of the past pioneers in achieving these goals.  He views computing solely from a consumer point of view, ignoring the vast gains in efficiency and choice made possible through the vast computing infrastructure supporting modern day life.  As Schneiderman puts it, "old" computing is concerned with technology.  These researchers and practitioners are concerned with increasing speed, decreasing cost, and improving reliability.  In contrast, he views "new" computing as a focus on improving people's experience with technology.  This is a perfect example of the author's lack of technical competence.  The only way that reliability is increased, user interfaces improved, and the experience of using a computer made more artistic and enjoyable is through improved computer speed and reliability.  As an example, the aesthetically pleasing effect (in the new iTunes version) of flipping through album covers relies upon powerful computing technology.  Schneiderman's dichotomy between "old" and "new," and downright distain for people interested in the former, is counter-productive.  In every field, there are different groups working on different problems.  While it is reasonable to argue for one's particular area of interest, it is incredibly narrow-minded to argue that it is the only field of interest.  Lastly, I found the author's presentation of historical Leonardo anecdotes incidental to his arguments.  Rather than being the basis for the book, Schneiderman descends into the meaninglessness of arguing that Leonardo would "put man at the center" of the design process, or would like portable devices of different size screens.  
 I wouldn't call these a regrettable purchase...I guess I was just a little mislead about how these thing worked.  It doesn't explain that on the packaging.   I couldn't figure out why the box was so heavy.  They are just socks, right?  Right??  Well, they aren't.  The insides are coated with some sort of heavy-duty silicone.  This makes your feet sweat when you put them on.  I mean, they really sweat.  When you wake up, you're feet have sweat so much that any outer layer of skin cells you have sloughed off.  Hence the soft feet.  And very warm feet.  They'll be good for winter.  The reason why you're only supposed to wear these once a week is because I bet you'll get a really alarming fungus if you do it more.  I tried them two nights in a row once and day 3 greeted me with an intense athletes-foot-like itch.  Not fun.    The other gripe I have is that they don't come with washing instructions.  Great.  These socks have one purpose in life, and that is to make your feet sweat and then refuse to be washed.  I found that handwashing them in the sink with some handsoap works fine.  For now, anyway.  I don't think they belong in the washing machine.  A laundry horror story is likely to ensue.     
 The clappy-happy endorsements of this book are unbelievable shills- like the book itself. Keep looking. There are much better books out there. And no, Heiman doesn't need it, and Tom Hopkins is definately not the pick of the litter 
 Seldom is a film so bad that I waste my time reviewing it, but this action fiasco is simply so horrible it's worth the effort. I am a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, and while I've never ranted at the Academy for overlooking him at Oscar time, I have on enough occassions enjoyed Dolph Lungren that I thought we had a chance here. Ninety minutes later, I was ready to go find someone to give me a hug and make me forget having ever seen it. This film fails in every possible way, and action film with no action, a post-apocalyptic with only passing reference to peril and no cool costuming eye candy, a war story with no discernable plot or point, a romance with all the chemistry of a stale pop-tart. This film couldn't even manage to be offensive. I'm sure everyone shares blame in it, the writers, the actors, the director. For goodness sake, if you have some critical need to see this, be it Dolph Lungren fan or masochism, wait for a tv broadcast. Waste as little money as possible 
 Se voce esta procurando um livro que ensine como montar um "gaiola" ou "dune bug", esqueca este livro. Ele fala muito sobre motor, freio, etc. Sobre a estrutura, ou "frame", so da algumas dicas de como procurar para comprar. Ridiculo ne  
 You would think that when you buy a bracket of any sort, the package would include the mounting screws.  Well, this doesn't and you aren't made of aware of that until you open the box.  I'm a strong advocate of Linksys products but this falls under the category of "screw the customer" 
 With all of the great reviews and the author's reputation, I was expecting a lot more.  I just don't see anything new here, to me it reads like a dictionary on dressage.  Fine, but not too interesting.  I guess what really put me off straight away, was the the author's claim that horses are not very intelligent, and if they were we would be afraid to be near them at all.  And "A horse will never do anything on purpose".  I think that anyone who has spent a lot of time around horses would disagree with that statement.  For example, if you have ever seen a horse work open a stall latch, I think you might agree that they are capable of doing things on purpose and with planning.  From someone who supposedly stresses love for the horse during training, I found these statements quite inaccurate and somewhat cold.  I've got loads of books on dressage, and this one would be at the bottom of my list 
 The sub-header to this book could very well be: "All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy".   Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:   Millionaires, you see:   1) Save more than they spend;   2) Don't spend anything.   That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.   To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?   Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.   It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.  But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.   The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.   This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?  I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.   But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?   Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.   "Millionaire Next Door" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.   "Millionaire Next Door" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.   But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?   JS 
 I bought this DVD despite the mixed reviews and have to report that I was disappointed with the purchase.  I have another Pilates tape (not DVD) that was one continuous workout which I much prefer.  With this one, there was no time in between transitions and there often were no clear transitions.  I also found that it went way too fast and tried to cram in too many things into each session 
 Kaplan is an excellent writer with several great titles to his credit.  However, "Warrior Politics" is not one of them.  While Kaplan's prose is crisp and pointed, he loses focus on his subject roughly 80 pages or so into the book, and the reader is left with a muddled mess.   Secondly, Kaplan's main thesis (the need of world leaders to embrace a 'pagan' disposition and to learn from the past) varies at times from obvious to silly.  Along with these fundamental problems, Kaplan also inserts extreme claims (i.e. Churchill single-handedly saved the West) without defense or solid explanation.  Also, the author contradicts his own points several times over within the brief text.  It seems the initial idea for this work, albeit a tad obvious, is interesting enough.  However, the following body of work fails to deliver on an intriguing premise.  For fans of Kaplan, prepare to be disappointed.  For those new to his work, don't judge the writer solely on this book 
 This is the follow-up to "Witch Child", exploring what happened to Mary after we left her. I almost think it would have been better if the author had left the story of Mary open-ended then tried to connect it to Agnes, a modern-day Native American girl who has visions of Mary's life. The book jumps around a lot, often leaving whole chunks of time unexplained. It also was a bit annoying switching back and forth between Mary and Agnes. I did find parts of the book focusing on traditional Native American life interesting though 
 This book shows how Robert has been lying all along. He talks about how he bought his dream car while being homeless. Ok then, how did Robert make the monthly payment? Why would he be stupid enough to sleep in a Porsch as a bum? This guy is such a liar and is trying to con the masses. He is a conman and a good one. Thats why hes a motivational speaker. It takes a good speaker to con you out of your hard earned money. Don't fall for this conman! This book contradicts what Robert has been preaching in previous books. Robert says pay off your debt while he says he bought his dream car while being homeless. That would be odd but it isn't odd because Robert is a professional liar 
 I happened upon this book because a friend of mine suggested a book called "Motherless Daughters". This book came up in the search and I thought a workbook would be a great idea. What the description does not tell you is that this book is targeted solely to women that lost their mothers when they were children or teens. It is not geared towards women that lost their mothers as adults. In the forward, Gail Eisenberg states she responded to an add that specifically wanted women who lost their mothers during childhood and adolescence for this book. In chapter 2 the book states whether you were a young child or a college student..."  This book may be great for women who lost mothers during childhood or adolescence but it does not address nor is it designed to address the needs of women like myself who lost mothers after our 20's - adult women . If you lost your mother when you were an adult, this book was not intended for you. The authors or amazon probably should have noted that somewhere for grieving women in seek of help 
 Maybe it depends on the car, but I couldn't get it tight enough in my SUV to prevent the dogs from knocking it down.  It also probably depends on the dog.  If the dog really wants to get past it, they will.  If you have a more mellow dog who will be satisfied with a "psychological barrier", this would be ok.  Oh, and as a previous reviewer mentioned, the "trombone" style sides slide easily back and forth, I had to get some hose clamps to keep them in place 
 This book was terrible. I read Goethe's and Marlowe's versions of the Faust legend a few years ago. The Faust legend is one of the best stories in literature, but "Jack Faust" is disgusting. It is  unnecessarily profane. In my opinion it is an insult to the venerable Faust  legend 
 This story is full of surprises, which really made me want to keep reading. In one point of the story Palmer tells the "gang" that he does not want to become a wringer. This surprised me greatly because I thought that Palmer would become a wringer so he could keep his friends. I learned to always show your feelings and don't do something that you don't want to do just to get friends. I recommend this Fiction-Horror genre to readers of all ages.   
 this book is as much about the gypsy communities as it is about confirming the author's own preconceived notion of  what eastern europe is (or what is not): in her own words, "certainly not a melting pot."  i will not comment on how the author deals with the main subject of her book, on the gypsy communities, its cultural heritage and its current problems- as a romanian, i am ashamed i know very little about it, and i was hoping to find out some answers by reading this book; i did not. there is one point where i agree on with the autor, when she deplores the absence of this subject from the public debate and modern scholarship.  let me now say what this book excels at: A. lack of scholarship.....: the author does a poor job identifying her sources. the 15 century of eastern europe as seen through the eyes of this author is full of surprises; to give just one example, "the princes of the teritories that would become romania made great fortunes of war, supplying food to constantinople". this is quite funny  given the intricate politics among the ottoman empire and the various genoese and venetian principalities that controlled the trade in the area at that time. what is more surprising is the almost random insertion of this statement in the context of the book.  B... to donwright plagiarism: one chapter of her book is entitled "temptation to exist" which is the famous title of a book by the romanian author emil cioran. name-dropping cannot replace bibliography (and this is unfortunately one of the more annoying habits of romanian scholars that the author seemed to have taken to).  C.... to insulting ignorance: is she aware of the sympathy of young cioran for the iron guard movement in the 30'? is paraphrasing a fascist sympathizer appropriate in a book about opressed minorities?   D... to cold war cliches: "to the people of the balkans, [the ursars... gypsies travellers with dancing bears] must have been a wonderful sight in the grueling last years of communism. for some reason, in ceausescu's romania people continue to pay money..." a bit assuming isnt it? well, what else were doing romanians during communism? gymnastics, nastase, sucking their own blood...perhaps, since even even the "literacy of the average romanian" is subject of mockery. E...to selective 20 century history: here again the evil spirit of eastern european chauvinism  is the obvious cause of all the evils of the century, if it weren't for other standard choices: nazy germany, etc... how about mussolini? there is not one mention   about mussolini and the fate of gypsies in italy...   For various reasons (perhaps some or many of them good) the author hates the country i am from. sometimes i do too. but i think a writer, an intellectual, should always be ready to engage in dialogue and thus set an example rather than labelling people (who did not benefit from the same schooling as the author did) as ignorant folk. on the contrary, this author does not permit even her (close?) romanian asisstant so much as a "tentative revelation" on the subject (these are the author's own words!!), not to mention that she misspelled her name (twice) in the acknowledgement.    Finally, i have a recommendation if you want to know more about gypsies and eastern europe check out emir kusturica's brilliant movies 
 I bought this about  two years ago and it never worked very good for me. The handle doesn't stay together very good and it doesn't pick up much. I wouldn't recommend this sweeper to anyone. Don't waste your money on it 
 A friend recommended this book to me, so I was excited to read about a futurist's view on technology and medicine, since I work in biotechnology research for medical applications.  However, the outrageous claims and messianic wild-eyed tone of this book really cranked up my B.S.-meter. Kurzweil's admitting to taking *250* (!) supplements a day both orally and IV was the real clincher.  This guy is neurotic.  He is so afraid of his own death, so blinded by technology and his scientific orgasms, that he fails to take into account the complexity of the human condition, both individually and collectively.  He ignores those facets of being human that don't jibe with his hyper-intellectual, reductionist views.  Human beings evolved to both think AND to feel.  He has reduced human beings to merely thinking machines.  He dreams of a future where we transfer our consciousness to robots, thus shedding the mortal coil of our biological bodies (which he hilariously calls 'version 1.0').  But having a biological body is an intrinsic aspect of being human.  So much of our life revolves around eating, sleeping, dreaming, touching, sex, growing, and so on.  If we give all that up, will we still be human?  What's more, many people don't see death as the end of their consciousness, as they believe in the immortality of the soul.  Kurzweil comes from a very narrow cultural niche, the nerdy materialist/atheist Western technologist.  How many people of the world, from the devout religious folks of Islam and Christianity, to the earth-centered native peoples around the globe and New Agers, will buy into this technolust vision?  Don't hold your breath waiting for 2045 
 With "Death on the Nile," the producers of the A&E "Poirot" series can claim to have broken all ties with the original British program starring David Suchet, save the presence of the star. The qualities that made the original program endearing-the wit, the exquisite production design, the fastidious attention to detail, the superb character acting of both the regulars and guests-are gone. That is not to say that this new Poirot is completely devoid of redeeming qualities, just that they pale in comparison with the original series.   The novel from which the movie is derived provides one of Christie's more complexly interwoven series of plots and sub-plots. It is no coincidence that the late 70s theatrical version starring Peter Ustinov ran well over two hours, and even at that simplified the story considerably. This new adaptation effectively eliminates the motivations for murdering the victim for most of the characters, and even those with motivation are given barely a scene or two to express those reasons. There really isn't much going on at all except the central love triangle and Poirot's sage pronouncements on the sidelines.  Even so, the movie seems to be rushing to its conclusion, as if all involved had other commitments they were eager to fulfill. Even Suchet just seems tired of the part, racing through his summing up speech as if reading a laundry list. (And the screenwriters really should be shot for burdening Poirot with pensive regrets about his failed love life. If there is one thing true of Christie's Poirot, it was that he didn't give a hoot about emotional entanglements. This is a sentimental hack's notion of "deepening" a character best known for his airy aloofness.)  The compensations? Some nasty humor at the edges which may not be everyone's cup of tea. Some nice location photography, and the occasional odd bit of behavioral detail from some of the supporting players. Alaistair MacKenzie as the aristocrat going through a Marxist phase and Steve Pemberton as the mysterious Dr. Bessner stand out. At their best, they are within calling distance of the better character playing in the series, although in Pemberton's case, at least, the character has been stripped of any motivation, and thus is something of a gratuitous appendage to the mystery.  Otherwise, it's a depressing lack of distinction across the board. A&E would be doing all of us a favor by stopping now, while they are behind. 
 For me the only thing this book has going for it is a good title.  I, too, was annoyed with Rebecca telling the story backwards but that wasn't enough for me to dislike the book.  In this Picoult debut, one thing is glaringly clear and it's that the author doesn't write men very well.  All the sections supposedly in the men's point of view--sounds like a woman.  Their thoughts their reasonings sounded feminine--like what a woman thought a man thought like--if that makes any sense.  And quite frankly I didn't care for Joley.  His love for his sister borders incestuous (he wants to be cremated and wore as a necklace so he can be close to her heart?), and his character is never consistent.  For the first half the book he's practically rooting for Jane to leave her husband at any cost and then he doesn't an abrupt about face with no real reason behind it.  Plus, there are sections when I question his mental health.  Was he borderline retarded? Plus, why was he so stunned that she may have slept with his boss?  In his point of view section, he gave her to the man.  He wasn't thinking about his niece then.  I don't have a problem with fifteen-year old Rebecca falls for a twenty year old man, that's normal to have crushes at that age.  But then to have the man fall for her and then consumate the relationship is more than I can stand.  It's called statutory rape.  And yes I understand that Jane fell for her husband at that age, BUT Jane and Oliver waited until she was older before consumating the relationship. The author tries to go through great pains to convince us that Rebecca is not the average fifteen year old--she mature and yada yada.  Since when?  Lord knows her mother will let her talk to any man, encourage her to roll down windows to talk to strangers, let strangers gawk at her.  Then the girl hitchhikes with truckers she knows who want to rape her.  I mean, come on. Jane, on top of being a horrible mother, garnered no sympathy points with me.  Her behavior in front her impressionable child is horrendous.  She teaches her child how steal food from a diner, how to steal money from a car dealer (a bad one), and then have an affair with a man she just met in a bedroom next door to the child.  Whatever.  Then instead of being the parent and putting an end of the relationship or haul Rebecca fast-butt out of there, she meekly goes to Sam and gives him the ultimatium to handle it.  WHAT??  Jane doesn't want a child, she wants a best friend.  Then she susposed to be some sacrifical lamb when she returns home with her husband.  Jane needs therapy--plain and simple. Oliver catches her in bed with another man and literally seconds later he's kissing her.  On what plantet?  I can't tell you how many eye rolls I did for the letters across the nation Joley did.  How do you write a letter to the post office addressed to someone who doesn't live or work there?  This isn't the 1800s.   Bottom line: Oliver and Jane are both abusers who deserve each other.  Nuff said 
 As the last story in this book proves, Rick Moody's stories are always about, you guessed it, Rick Moody.  Even when they're not explicitly about Rick Moody, the prose is screaming out, "Look at me!  Look how brilliant I am!"  Here's what I don't get about his most "experimental" work in this book: What is it that he's doing that's any better (or different) than what John Barth (and others) did in the '60s?  I can tell you: Nothing.  I'm not a big fan of Barth, but Barth, at least, is a very smart man, and his experiments are multi-layered.  They're also fun, by comparison.  You get the feeling that Rick Moody either hasn't read any of the postmodernists or that he doesn't understand that writing a story about writing a story really needs to do something that tops, say, John Barth's "Lost in the Funhouse."  David Foster Wallace, another writer I'm not keen on, at least understood this, and he used Barth's "Lost in the Funhouse" as a spring-board for the final story in his collection GIRL WITH CURIOUS HAIR.  And Wallace, at least, IS smart.  I suppose my main complaint is that Moody is writing in a historical vacuum, and yet he continues, in both his fiction and in interviews, to pat himself on the back.  My question is this: If Moody hadn't gone to two Ivy League schools, hadn't worked as an editor at FSG, hadn't lived in (or around) NYC, would anyone have published him?  Absolutely not.  Step outside of Manhattan, and you'll find Rick Moodys scribbling away and chuckling in Starbucks all across this country.  They're dime a dozen 
 worst movie.  bad acting, bad sex, bad everything.  not worth the cost of the disk.  not worth a cent.  offended not by nudity, but by bad acting, bad directing, bad casting.  bad movie 
 If being an author means collecting a few dozen quotes from various sources, sprinkling them with dry, useless opinions, and putting them together in an overpriced book, then I wager that anyone reading this can call themselves a writer.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because I liked the quotes. Warren Buffett is the world's greatest investor, the second richest man on the globe, and one of the very few who chose to stay out of the internet boom and bust. While millionaires and billionaires were overseeing the fading of their paper fortunes, Buffett was getting richer.  The many quotes offer an insight into the inner workings of Buffett, and that's really the only redeeming aspect of this book, if it can be called that. Whether your are a seasoned investor, a student of business, or someone looking to quote the words of one of the most brilliant men in the game, you will find value in this book 
 The CD was used as part of an Italia Fiesta we organised in Albury NSW, Australia. The music helped in setting the party atmosphere for the evening. The evening was held as fund raiser for the Murray Valley Sactuary Refugee Group. The evening was very successful 
 The author puts forth a "New view' and changes his story characters so then I didn't get my wish of 'how I would have hoped Soalme's d. turned out. 
 I found "Grief" to be engaging and fairly well-written, but the quality of the writing is uneven: while much is lovely and rings true, the dialogue is often stilted, and the insights into grieving often seem worn and elementary.  I wish the author had been able to get some insight into the protagonist's isolation, since the conclusion is resignation to self-created bleakness 
 I've been searching for a good book on Christian discipline, and I thought this might be it.  But after evaluating Clarkson's claims of what the Bible says about discipline, I had to return this book.  He has some great ideas, and I certainly lean toward using grace in raising young children.  But after a careful review of his word study on Proverbs, I can't come to the same conclusion that he does.  I even asked for my pastor's help, and he also does not feel that Clarkson is right in that regard.  I think he is correct at the end (...) when he says that it is a choice that parents need to make  but it is not mandated by the Bible.  And I know that there is probably useful information in this book, but too much of his discussion hinges on his Biblical conclusions that I find false 
 There are so many other sling out there.  Don't waste your timeor money on this.  I hated the padding as it was bulky constricting and hot.  It was also impossible to adjust.  I got a couple of slings from www.equanimitybaby.com and one from www.peppermint.com and love these. Bottom line, check out the other options, this one is a waste of $$$ 
 I got this book because I enjoy good literature and the reviews were decent. I know some people say this writer is gifted, but I don't see it. I thought it was a pretentious, depressing piece of crap. The characters were full of self-loathing and the "bright ending" didn't redeem anything, not the main character or the book 
 The reason all the other readers liked this book is because its preaching to the converted, they read a story they want to hear, dressed as a scientific interpretation of current research. Readers must realize that  Flannery is a paleontologist not an ecologist. In the Future Eaters, he  really only presents his conceptual model of the history of Australia and  is highly selective in his use of the scienfitic interpretation of the  literature, only including those which support his ideas. This is not how  science is done. On the extinction of the megafauna he ignores crticisms  that there isn't the fossil record to support some mass extinction. On the  post european exinction of Australia's mammals ignores all the existing  information supporting 3 alternaive hypothesis in favour of his pet idea on  the role of fire despite a lack of data on fire histories and an  experimental refutation of the notion. Given that I know he has been  extremely biased in his reading of this literature, I have serious doubts  about how selective he has been with other issues with which I am less  familiar, just so he can put together the same old story that humans are  bad, "nature" is good. We need to move forward in managing  damaged landscapes, beyond this self depravation, and make unbiased  scientific management decisions. This storybook on the Ecology of  Australian systems is just a distraction from that objectiv 
 I wish that tCoJCoLDS was as good at applying these principles as GBH is at writing them.  "He can talk the talk, but he doesn't walk the walk."  I'd be glad to provide anyone with details, andersandrobintronsen@yahoo.com  Love & Honesty are the Foundation of Christ's work here on earth, NOT endless, mindless details such as earrings, piercings/tattoos,'pretty' clothing: suits & ties, floor length dresses/skirts. It's thoughts of Kindness, Mercy & Forgiveness that count with Heavenly Father, NOT what we wear, how we look. Have a Great Day, God is Love.  
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I found myself listening for 30 seconds to each song and then skipping it.  It's nothing new.  It's not that it's a bad CD, it's just not very good.  The songs are a little more fast paced and "pop-ish."  Overall, the CD is a departure from her typical style.  I felt kind of like I had put 50 cents in the soda machine for a Coca-Cola and Dr. Pepper came out instead.  
 Listening to this album is like receiving a LONG SLOW ENEMA. I still have no idea what people see in this much OVERATED band. I understand the comparisons to U2 (which, by the way, is a far superior band), but Pink Floyd?? Pink Floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically!! Creep is their only good song.....There I said it 
 Rather sad book which draws on his erudition and his personal experience. The background is interesting, but when he describes his experience with his mother`s decline and death, for me he descends into unconvincing  sentimentality. I guess he should stick to the academic writing he is  undoubtedly skilled in, as those are the best parts of the book. Little  genuine experience of the relationship of the physical to the spiritual  desert comes through for me with any conviction. I`m glad he survived;but  it doesn`t share enough of his experience to enlighten me 
 If you follow the trajectory of James Baldwin's writing, you'll see that he established certain themes, then reiterated them in a variety of settings.  His themes are pertinent and show great insight, but if you were to read two or three of his books, by the time you got to the third, you'd say, "O.k., I get it already." Such is the case with Another Country.  If you've read any Baldwin, thematically it's nothing you haven't heard before.  But, his earlier novels were clearly stated, concise, and powerful as a result.  This novel is an unbelievably bloated mess which easily could have been half the length and still gotten its points across.  Every single scene goes on way too long, the dialogue between the characters is interminable and pedantic, and there is an element of melodrama better served in soap operas.   Baldwin has said that this was the novel that meant the most to him, which is further proof that artists aren't necessarily the best judges of their work.  Go Tell It On The Mountain is a masterpiece and most indicative of Baldwin's considerable literary powers, and I would recommend you read that or Giovanni's Room, which is less powerful, but eloquent and substantial.  Another Country is a slog that doesn't repay in substance the efforts necessary to get through it 
 Did I miss something?  Clearly from the title alone Dr. Sarno believes tension and tightening of muscles is the cause of most back/leg pain.  Where is the chapter that gives you steps to change this?!  I didn't need to buy this book 
 Is there substance?  Yes, not a lot, but there is a brief overview of history here.    Is there fluff?  Oh hell yes and way too much of it.  There are just way too many asides and way too much focus on kings rather than conditions.  For example, he explains that Caesar may have had a homosexual escapade in Spain.  NOT PERTINENT and a little offensive to boot.  Remove such things and you have about 50 pages of worthy reading and I have to question some of his findings in those 50.    He goes to great lengths to brush over Spanish atrocities in the New World and at Home, claiming they are basically English racism towards the Spanish designed as a PR campaign against.  I have no doubt that such existed as the two countries have long had problems, but that doesn't mean the Spanish Conquistadors weren't brutal (and downright evil at times).  And the Inquisition should never have detractors.  The most telling moment of the book happens, after detailing this "racism", he then goes on another aside to tell how the Irish sold out the Spanish for a bottle of whisky. Holy crap is that the pot calling the kettle black and how any editor would let that slip through, calls into question the entire book.  So I learned a little from it, but it's not worth your effort.  Seek other books.  
 This book lost almost all his credibility. Why ? How, in a book called "FRENCH ACES OF WW II", the writer dedicates only five lines ( that's right, five lines !! )to the greatest of them all, Pierre Clostermann of the RAF ?!! ( according to French official sources quoted by the author himself ). It seems that the writer want to avoid the controversy surrounding Clostermann scores: the British ( for whom he flew during all his career in WW II ) credit him with between 11 and 15 air victories, and the French give him 33 !! Ohter than this, the book doesn't even mention Rene Mouchotte, a great leader of the first Free French squadrons in RAF - numbers 340 and 341 ( although he was not an ace ). Weird distribution of topics, because Frenchmen in the RAF have only six pages to their credit ...It seem the writer got completely lost in the vast ammount of information he probably had, and the result was this catastrophic, disappointing book !! 
 I should first say that I have not watched the series, but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so. I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was "Big top Pee-Wee", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.  In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.  The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.  The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably. I considered turning this off several time but felt that I should finish and form a complete opinion about it. Well I have and it aint good.

 If you are an absolute beginner and have never danced at all before, then you may find this course to be helpful.  Otherwise, there are better instructional videos out there. The technique and style demonstrated are not of professional calibre.  Also, the course claims to demonstrate 30 patterns.  The number is nowhere near that, and is closer to 15, total (almost 5 basic patterns per dance).  I say almost, because in one of the patterns, he calls the exit of the step by another pattern name. Sadly, the pattern name he uses is nothing like the pattern known in most dance circles.  However, the audio CD which is included is quite good. 
 I AM A BIG FAN OF " AMERICAN ME "  " BLOOD IN BLOOD OUT " ETC. BUT THIS ONE JUST TOTALLY SUCKED!!! IT HAS REALLY CHEESY SOUND EFFECTS AND THE STORY IS WELL NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT. I THINK YOU SHOULD WATCH " SCARFACE " " GOODFELLAS" " GOD FATHER " TRAFFIC " CARLITOS WAY " BLOW " 21 GRAMS " TRAINING DAY "   JUST TO SAME A FEW 
 No directions - these kids have to figure out what these cryptic codes mean without an instruction manual or any indication of what the buttons are for. The kids spent their own money on a cool toy.......they thought- do not buy unless you are a nuclear physicist 
 Tripe, its own self.   I've watched grass grow with more verve and enthusiasm. Disch is an author who was let in when the publishers opened the sci-fi floodgates in the mid-60s...and it shows. 
 Teen Love on Relationships cannot even begin to compare with the Chicken Soup books.  There were too many questions and not enough stories.  And the questions that were asked are not usual questions that older teens would  ask.  Stick to the chicken soup

 Most of Mark's work is just wonderful but this efforet's underpar. Read, 'What On Earth Is Going On' It's Mark's best outline to date and covers the same ground here 
 For those who grew up watching Gene Kelly's "Singin' in the Rain" and "On the Town," the MGM mishmash of "Anchors Aweigh" (1945) will prove a disappointment. Nevertheless, there are some magical moments. The film's highlight is Gene's breakthrough dance with Jerry the Mouse -- a stunning fusion of animation and live-action. Along the way, Frank Sinatra sings a few memorable numbers amid the Technicolor splendor. However, you must keep your finger on the fast-forward button to encounter these gems. Running 140 minutes, it's obvious that the editor fell asleep at the Moviola. Though directed by the usually reliable George Sidney, one wishes Kelly had more creative control over this unwieldy project. "Anchors Aweigh" should be viewed as a warm-up to the far-superior "On the Town." 
 I chose this book from a list of books from Focus on the Family. The book seemed to have some good concepts, but failed to deliver its message. The author seemed to use a lot of stories from his life, but the book failed to make the connection of raising a daughter. I have a 4 year old daughter and really did not get much from reading this book. My expectations of what I wanted to get from this book were high, but were never met 
 I had looked forward to this book so much and I was so disappointed. It was incredibly slow moving which puzzled me until I realized that these were a bunch of college lectures hobbled together. She went on and on about food but after reading Julia Child's book the descriptions were flat not exciting. If you want to read someone who appreciates food, read Child not Mayes. I really couldn't stand how she mocked other tourists because, believe it or not, Ms. Mayes you too are a tourist. If I was that cruise company, I'd send her a bill. She also seems to have a major problem with overweight people. It was a catty, boring book. I wished I had read the reviews before I bought it 
 Jaci really misfired on this one. Aside from one decent single, the rest of this album is just awful. And, being that it was her first crossover attempt, failed in every way. It was a stumble, but Jaci's next few were awesome.  I wouldn't even recommend this if it were 1999 again. The quality is subpar compared to Thalia, Noelia--heck, even Paulina. It is possible to make a clean, family friendly latin pop album without sucking 
 I just touched this brush with my fingers and thought "how could anyone use this to bathe with?" 
 I am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book.  Honestly, it was a complete waste of my time.  To quote a friend, it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar.  If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book 
 These DVDs continue to be bitter disappointments. They crop the image, they only put 3 on a CD, and they release them sporadically. This is the last one I will ever buy - I just got a DVD burner and I'll burn new episodes. For old episodes, just head over to ebay, there are some wonderfully produced bootleg sets out there. I just dropped $70 for seasons 1&2 - gorgeous case, menus, high quality widescreen, and even bonus features. It could have been Time-Warner's $70, but they continue to be stupid and greedy about their DVD sets 
 It may be a matter of personal taste, but I felt the book was a jumble of mostly overdone product without a sense of relationship between materials that were chosen for the finished piece.  It is possible that the photography played a part in this - was color accurate?  I have used a lot of found materials - many discarded and worn with much more subtle results.  Where is the mystery 
 This is a well-written and seemingly well-researched book that has at the center of its thesis the idea that the Dutch brought religious tolerance to America. Yet amazingly Shorto nowhere mentions Roger Williams, who founded Rhode Island on the basis of absolute religious freedom, the first government anywhere in the world to practice total separation of chruch and state. People were being kicked out of "tolerant" New Amsterdam/New York because of their religion, and they then fled to R.I.   To shore up his thesis, Shorto also often compares New Amsterdam to the United Colonies of the English, which were intolerant. But again nowhere mentions that those colonies (Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, New Haven, and Connecticut)would not allow RI to join them, because of RI's religious tolerance.   This oversight is either dishonest-- he doesn't mention RI because it interferes with his thesis-- or a sign of utter incompetence-- is he so bad a researcher that he doesn't know anything about RI?   Either way, it's too big a failing not to fail this book, despite many other good points about it 
  Well this is the way it has been ever since after Jay Z's classic album Reasonable Doubt. A bunch of empty fluff lyrics recited over well produced tracks. If you want to dance then this album is cool, but if you want lyrical content go somewhere else. The track "Lucifer" was an exception, dosen't even sound like the same guy responsible for garbage like "Dirt on your Shoulder" wrote that. The track "Threat" was also ok. I'm going to give it two stars;One for the production, and one for the track "Lucifer".   
 I have to be honest.  I've only liked one of Larry McMurtry's books, and that was Lonesome Dove.  But even the sequels to that, however mediocre they may have been, had some literary quality to them that was completely lacking in Anything for Billy.  There was no character development, and what action did take place either was over before it began or was "off screen."  Two-thirds of his characters died without uttering so much as a sentence.  Even the deaths of "major" characters (as few as there were) were treated as afterthoughts.  The two-page chapters were a major distraction.  Every time he got a narrative going, he ended it abruptly only to start somewhere else completely on the next page.  It just didn't flow well at all 
 This book was recommended to me by a friend who said it was great.  As a dark-skinned child of immigrant parents, I do not exactly share the same family history as African-Americans whose ancestors came to the US by way of slave plantations - but I grew up in a African American neighborhood, and have shared the expereince of what it is to be dark-skinned and poor in the US with my freinds and neighbors.  That said, I was eager to read this book - and was sadly disappointed to find it a thinly-veiled cheerleading piece for all of the major Republican political agenda items, rather than the inspiring and thought-provoking book I had been lead to expect.  Star presents a point-by-point plan for 'fixing' poverty:  - dismantle multiculturalism... [ie - ingore America's legacy as a nation of immigrants]  - abolish affirmative action... [ie - get rid of all protections against racism that have made education accesible to non-rich persons of color]  - Abandon the faith-based initiative... oddly, because it isn't a total give-away of dollars to church-run programs, but because it asks for accountability for where the dollars go [???]   - Privatize welfare   - Privatize schools ... thought this has failed abbysmally in Baltimore and other areas where it has been tried.  - Privatize social security... give the money formally invested in US bonds via social security to Wall Street - who have a track record of caring about poor folks and people of color.  This is a list of Republican talking points from a Sunday morning news show, NOT a manifesto for helping the poor and people of color in Amewrica today.  The benefit of these steps would be to give more money and power to those who already have it, and make those without money and power the scapegoats for the system.  In light of the recent revelations that Armstrong Williams took $240,000 to plug Republican talking points on his show and in his writing, it makes me wonder how big a check Star Parker got from the GOP to write this book...   
 This book, like the Atkins approach in general, has part of the picture, but is certainly incomplete.  Moderation, not virtual elimination, of carbohydrates, when paired with lean protein, plenty of omega 3 (fish and flax oils), and monounsaturated oils (like olive oil), has been shown to be the healthiest diet (a Mediterranian type diet). The Atkins approach does not advocate moderation, instead prefering to vilify an entire necessary macronutrient - carbohydrates!  Certainly the old fashioned 1980's style high carb low fat diets were a disaster, and brought out diabetes in susceptible people - but the answer is balance - good quality, naturally high fiber carbs, paired with protein and healthy fat - not virtual elimination of carbs.  Inadequate carbohydrate intake can lead to fatigue and reluctance to exercise.  Dr. Vernon herself continues to struggle with her weight, despite following the Atkins approach. Most Americans will initially lose weight when starting on Atkins because most eat FAR too many carbs.  But they also eat too much saturated fat (animal and dairy fat, for the most part), which has been show to worsen insulin problems and diabetes, and aggravate cholesterol and artery inflammation, worsening risk of heart disease and stroke.  Atkins addresses one of the these culprits (excess sugar), but not the other (excess saturated fat).  Americans need to cut down on these, and then add more good fats (fish, nuts, olive oil, avacado), lean protein (to cut down on saturated fat), and not be afraid of healthy carbs in the form of whole fruits (not juice), vegetables, and whole grains (not white bread or sugary low fiber cereal).  That, plus watching the calories, and daily exercise (at least 30 " of moderate cardio, five days a week), and diabetes will DRAMATICALLY improve.  Try it and see! Health is not just about weight - its about healthy body fat and muscle ratios, and what is going on inside your body - in your arteries, your brain, etc.  The studies all support healthy balance.   
 This menure is almost as bad revisionism as the irish fairy tale book! He as usual does not sight his sources, and appears to make it up as he goes. Miss MacDonald's review said it very well. If you believe in anything Cahill spews, you may as well believe the "Sun rises in the west." I won't waste another nano-second on anything this hack writes 
 Scarpetta, Marino, Benton, and Lucy are all back with another good guy gets bad guy caper.  The bad guy in this case is mad at Lucy because of something she inadvertantly caused when she was 17 that ruined his life.  So he winds up stalking her and killing others.  What the fabulous four don't know is that the individual crimes they are each investigating all wind up being linked together and committed by the same bad guy.  The story also places much emphasis on their personal lives which all pretty much suck.  They are all alone and miserable in their own ways and don't seem to be able to do much about it.    Sadly, I can't muster up anything nice to say about this book.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the fondness I still have for the early books in the series.  Once upon a time I bought the new releases in this series the day the hardback came out and stayed up all night to read them.  But with this one, there is nothing about it that makes it worth reading.  There are even places where the grammar is just horribly and shockingly incorrect.  Cornwell didn't used to be this sloppy or seem to care so little for a series that she spent such time and effort developing.  I hate to see them go, but after the next one (which unfortunately I already bought) I think I'm done 
 For starters, if you love Connick's croon you don't get it very much on this album. It's primarily a showcase for his work on the ivories.   Those who know Connick well realize his capacity on the instrument and his ability to re-invent dusty classics and make them new again. (His take on "Sleigh Ride" from WHEN HARRY MET SALLY was a great example.) Unfortunately, most of these numbers, while experimental, just don't work that well in the end.  Case in point: Harry's attempt to inflate 70s piffle "Tie a Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Ole Oak Tree" into grand player piano roll music. He succeeds in making it sound "old" but not in imbuing it with elegance..it's simply a fluffy piece of pop music and the arrangement only succeeds in demonstrating the lack of substance underneath the fluff in the Tony Orlando rendition.   HIGHLIGHTS: Gospelly "There is Always One More Time" gets a lot of its punch from Reverend James Moore's vocals and organ playing. Porter standby "Don't Fence me In" gets a nice Nawlins' shuffle and a relaxed vocal from Connick.   LOWS: "I'm Walkin'" completely enervates the Fats Domino classic of all its drive and forces this listener to realize how much that song's greatness derives from Domino's exuberant singing and the Dave Bartholomew rhythm section. Bleah. "The Gypsy" is a complete yawn. The aforementioned "Tie a Yellow Ribbon" is another miss.  BOTTOM LINE: I got this one for free as a promo while working as a record store clerk. It was worth what I paid. Skip this one 
 This director mistakes lame attempts at surrealism for art. Artsy-fartsy disjointed and meaningless scenes leave the viewer benumbed and wondering what this movie is about.  Speaking Russian is no help in discovering the point of this wan effort. 
 I've seen ethan hawk's best performance ever in this movie. it was great. Wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie. it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, this movie does not worth to buy. does not even worth to rent. but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally. It's worth to be watch once at TV! By the way, I forgot to mention that this movie has a great CD soundtrack, really great. worth to buy 
 Let me start this review by saying that I really wanted to like this book. I first read "Like Water For Chocolate" about 10 years ago, and agree with many that the book is a modern-day literary masterpiece. I sought out and bought "The Law of Love" when it was published, and came away from it rather disappointed... Somehow, Esquivel's socially insightful and cohesive prose in "Like Water For Chocolate" - arguably on a par with Jane Austen or Daphne du Maurier in capturing romantic sentiment without seeming treacly - had, in "The Law of Love", devolved into an adolescent pastiche of the worst that the sci-fi and romance genres have to offer.  To me, though, a 'three strikes and you're out' rule seems like a fair approach to an author. As such, I purchased "Malinche", hoping that Esquivel could still measure up to Isabel Allende and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, other authors whose works were firmly and powerfully grounded in the magical realism that Esquivel employed so well in "Like Water For Chocolate". But I couldn't even finish "Malinche". It was so mind-blowingly awful that I found myself getting angry. It confirmed something that I didn't want to believe - the artistry of "Like Water For Chocolate" was a complete fluke, and never again would Esquivel produce a comparable novel.  Save yourself the money, but most importantly, save yourself the heartbreaking disappointment - Esquivel really is a one-trick pony, and sadly, she should find herself a new career 
 I think the Melvins' career can be broken into a few clearly separate "acts":  Prelude- 1983 to 1985   Hardcore. Loud, fast, snotty. (see: Deep Six compilation album, EDIT- and the soon-to-be-released Mangled Demos)    Act 1- 1986 to 1989  Buzz (founder, guitarist, songwriter) was heavily inspired (no pun intended) by Black Flag's 'My War' album, particularly side 2, which was composed of three very long droning dirges. The Melvins' songs became a bit heavier and often slower. Some of their earlier songs might have been considered speed metal, but at this point you could hear a definite '70s "regular" heavy metal element in some songs. A very original sound at the time, many other local bands followed suit; the Melvins' change in direction is arguably single-handedly responsible for starting the "grunge" thing in Seattle, for better or worse. (see: debut EP, Gluey Porch Treatments, Ozma)  Act 2- 1990 to 1992  Their sound became, for lack of a less lame cliche, extreme. They were no longer "kinda heavy," they were extremely heavy. The song writing and live performances became confrontational. Riffs and rhythms were often so drawn out and plodding that they were scarcely recognizable. In other instances there were no riffs at all, a storm of white noise taking their place. Listening to the Melvins sometimes made you feel like you were a mastodon slowly sinking into a tar pit. I personally consider this to be the Melvins' at their peak. One of my personal highlights was seeing them play in Costa Mesa CA in 1991; in the middle of their set, Buzz began spewing atonal noise from his amp while Dale pretended to hit his drums. This went on for several minutes. Some fratboy types, at the behest of their girlfriends, approached the stage to make them stop. Their demands and pleas fell on deaf ears. Glorious.(see: Bullhead, Eggnog, Lysol [a.k.a. "Melvins"/self titled])   Act 3- 1993 to present  Houdini marks the beginning of this era. The Melvins suddenly abandoned the heavy approach. They completely lost focus and embarked on journey of discovery that usually involved ho-hum "hard rock" song writing and dabbling in experimental weirdness. Unfortunately, the experiments almost always fail. Or at least fail to be enjoyable listening. (see: Houdini, Stoner Witch, Stag, and whatever else they've put out in the last 10 years)  As far as I'm concerned, they do still squirt out the occasional great song, but by and large they probably could have called it quits in 1994 and left the music world a beautiful corpse to admire forever and ever. It happens all the time. A band spends all of their creative juices until nothing's left, but they keep going. Not that I blame them. What else are they supposed to do? Sell insurance?   EDIT- "to dismiss 'what ever they have done in the last ten years' without even bothering to listen to it is just plain ignorant."  I agree, that IS ignorant. You'll be happy to know that I own and have listened to every single record the Melvins have ever released, including Never Breathe, with the one exception of Roman Empire. (EDIT- I now own Roman Empire) I would have listed them all by name, but there are a lot of them, and their titles weren't readily jumping into my mind anyway. And I'll continue to buy their records, always in the hope that they somehow get the fire back and do something worthwhile again. I'll let you know as soon as that happens.   EDIT- "The truth is, the Melvins, while most worthy of the played out "grunge" title, are not responsible for it at all. They are in fact "dirge metal". They are not Northwest, rather Bay Area."  Incorrect, sir. The Melvins formed in WA circa 1983. According to Kim Thayil, the "Seattle scene" was your average hardcore punk scene at the time, but after the Melvins slowed down and took on a more metallic sound, a lot of the bands in the area followed suit. That was how the "grunge" thing began. They didn't move to San Francisco CA until 1988 or '89. 
 one piece of advise: get your bachelor's degree in neuroscience, then go ahead and attempt this book. i was extremely frustrated by the complexity of this book and im a sophomore neuroscience student. im just confused as to why this book was aimed at the general public. there are tons of other books that are more understandable, and interesting. check out crick's "the astonishing hypothesis" and koch's "the quest for consciousness", they are more worth the money and time. if you're looking for first hand experience of a brain aneurysm then buy this book, it'll give you one lickity split...that's likely the only thing you'll learn about the brain from this book 
   You know, sometimes you just hate the amazon rating system. Parts of this ponderous tome deserve a one. Others deserve, oh, maybe a three-and-a-half.   Well, everyone who dislikes Harold Bloom points out that he's pompous. So what. Pompous people are amusing. Besides, you have to be pompous to write 745 page book, and expect people to read it, while also whining about the lack of reading done these days. Besides which, I would not have picked up this book without being attracted by the extraordinary pompousness of the title, and the idea which I thought the book propounded.   Boy, oh, boy, I thought, as I staggered from the Barnes & Noble, carrying the book, a huge fat volume with a pompous title. This could be fun to read, because pompous people can be very, very witty, and interesting. You have to have a sort of laughing in your own sleeve humor, I assumed, to propound such things. It also takes guts, and courage, which I honestly admit that Mr. Bloom has.   A feeling of alarm began to take over me, however, when I began to read the book. I assumed, along with his thoughts on Will's plays, that he would skillfully, masterfully propound his theory on HOW and and perhaps WHY Shakespeare kindly invented the personality as we know it today. However, this did not seem forthcoming.   Instead, Bloom happily insisted that Will did so- you know, he "just did". The references to this theory seem to something like "If Will hadn't been, we wouldn't be like we are today."   Well! That was really simple. I think any idiot could say that Shakespeare has had a HUGE impact on our culture. Thus, if he HADN'T written, that impact would be GONE! Basically, that is the feeble idea Bloom bases his entire theory on. Hey, I might even agree with Bloom, if he had actually presented this Theory- instead of the lame idea that, well, yeah, Will kinda changed the way we now live.   There was a hugely amusing aspect to this book. That was Mr. Bloom's insane fixation with Falstaff and Hamlet. For fun, I opened the book at complete random, and in three out of three, found Hamlet and Falstaff mentioned twice together, and Hamlet once by himself. This is an acurrate summing up of Bloom's slavish devotion to these characters. NO ONE is better than these characters, NO ONE can accurately be measured until the ruler of Fal/Hal have been applied.    In completely different plays, SOMEHOW one, or both of these two are mentioned. At first amusing, one begins to doubt Bloom's sanity. Also, his honesty, because some comparisons are so strained, you wondered "So, as this guy PAID each time he used these guys' names?" If so, he was rich before the book was even published.   What I absolutely give a one, is Bloom's skill as a writer, which is this: nil.    Nil, nada, nothing.   Although you would think through his intensive reading, our Educated Author would have some idea of how to write, he doesn't. He rambles. Endlessly. I don't pinpoint that as an utter fault. Yet he can never, ever, ever, gather his ideas together clearly, and succintly. As a critic, this is the The Fault. He also makes hundreds of statements, apparently expecting you to simply accept them with no argument. Pompousness I can take. Sheer, encrusted, old-man arrogance I cannot.   I would love, love, love to have C.S.Lewis alive today. If Bloom's books are bloated, Lewis's are positively anorexic. Yet Lewis puts forth more ideas and logic in a chapter than Bloom can vomit up in a lifetime. The keen, cutting wit of Lewis could cut through the excess, and show Bloom as he is- an old man, infatuated with himself, and how many words he can place on the paper. As a critic, as he is hailed to be, Bloom is almost nothing. Even the ideas that seem orignal are never actually discussed- the other ideas wander on like those guys in that poem, the Ancient Mariner.    What amazes me is this. In the plays Bloom seems least fond of, he sometimes comes across as vaguely coherent. As evidenced by the slim 17 pages allocated to Romeo and Juliet, he obviously doesn't like a play the average person "gets". However, his idea that Shakespeare HAD to kill Mercutio was stated simply, and actually sparked returning ideas in the reader.   Bloom identifies himself with Falstaff. Yet, I would liken him more to Mercutio- in this sense. Here follows a quotation from Romeo and Juliet. The nurse speaks in reference to Mercutio, who has just been his delightfully rude self.   Nurse: I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his ropery?   Romeo: A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.   Only Mercutio is funny, charming even. Bloom is tedious. I do not say: Do not read this book. Its influence has been too wide not to at least have a vague idea of what this man says...over...and over...again. Bloom may be a terrible critc and writer, but he has got himself noticed, probably because of the fact that so few people ARE as well-read as he is.   So read the book for the ideas. Don't be surprised, however, at the very few ideas presented throughout such a large book. Orginality and creativity were obviously never this man's talent. The few he has, he clings to like leech, and repeats- repeatedly ( ha, ha)  
 Normally I read a book of this type in a day or two. This one took over two weeks because I couldn't get past reading a chapter or two at a time before I had to put it down.  Carolyn Blue may be the most stupid, irritating character to hit the cozy scene in a long time. She's pushy, nosy, condescending and flat out stupid. The whole book consisted of her eating and running around talking to people. The plot and the story never moved forward -- she just happened to show up at the murderer's place one time when he decided to let her in and confess.  Cross this author off your list, and save your money 
 In this sixth (but not final) installment of the movie series, what we get is little story and too much senseless action (with a sprinkling of hot tub sex).  This is a very disappointing film.  Although it is the last such LWnC movie from this creative team, it does not end the storyline (with 28 volumes in the manga series, we probably would have needed another 3-7 films).  So the patient, constant viewer gets instead a hack-and-slash film of mid-caliber.  The ending -- an over-extending action sequence set on a snowy slope -- is very unsatisfying; so are the characters:  unlike other LWnC films, we do not get to meet any new incidental characters.  As a result, the film is less about "Edo" soceity (which one cannot argue is the secondary if not primary goal of the manga team) and instead just a big showdown waiting to happen...waiting, waiting to happen.  The film is way too long and its pacing is horrible.  I think the fault with the film lies in these two things: 1) the writers/filmmakers chose poor source material.  The "five wheel" assassin team denies Itto and son the chance to mingle with regular Edo joes.  As a result, you do not get as I argued the best part of the series:  the rich detail of Edo life. 2) the filmmakers must have been overwhelmed with James Bond films like "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" and whatnot with their decision to make this movie "samurai on skis".  After the first few minutes of fighting on the snow, I was thinking "Enough already, I get it:  samurai can be badass even on slippery surfaces!"  Watch the first five and forever skip this sixth installment 
 Buyer Beware: The detailed packaging of this deck is misleading and not at all representative of the lackluster cards contained within.  I am an avid Reader and Collector of Tarot Cards, and I also have a degree in Psychology - so I was looking forward to this deck. I had hoped this deck would combine some interesting Jungian symbolism with the ancient Tarot mysticism. But it falls very short in this regard. There is truly almost NO symbolism in the deck...much of the Rider Waite type symbology has been removed, and it has not been replaced with anything of a new, unique or remotely "psychological" nature.   Indeed, many of the "characters" sit alone on stark backgrounds of sky or water with NO surrounding symbolism at all. The Page, Knight, Queen & King in each suit looks like the exact same person in different clothing. Most disappointing, however, is the totally unimaginative Minor Arcana - which is just a "pip" deck of numbered swords, cups, wands and pentacles with absolutely NO SURROUNDING SYMBOLISM, other than sky or water. I find this type of "lazy" deck to be very boring & less than stimulating for the average Querant. I agree fully with the previous reviewer, who considered this purchase a "waste of money."  While selecting a Tarot Deck is a very personal matter, UNLESS you prefer a totally "minimalist" deck with muted colors, repetitive imagery and little symbolism, this deck is probably not for you 
 Triple H: N'SYNC should be called XTINKT! Shawn Michaels: You got that right Triple H! Triple H: Is it me or does Justin look like Kenny of The Spirit Squad. Shawn Michaels: Yes and he sounds like him, a wuss who would get beaten up by D-GENERATION X! Triple H: Also, Bye Bye Bye and It's Gonna Be Me are as bad as eating a rotted tuna fish sandwich. Shawn Michaels: Also, Steve Miller should sue these losers and Left Eye's estate for stealing Space Cowboy from him! Triple H: What next, Bratney Sneers calling herself The Gangsteress of Love. Shawn Michaels: We don't have to worry about XTYNCT anymore as they are disbanded, especially after Lance admitted to loving things who had last names like Clark, Cheney, Embersol and Parry. If you are not down with D-X, WE GOT TWO WORDS FOR YA(crowd yells "S*CK IT!") 
 Some good ideas on driving innovation, but in hindsight, some of the cited companies haven't passed muster if one tracks their long term business performance.  One of my favorite quotes from the book - "At Enron, failure - even of the type that ends up on the front page of The Wall Street Journal - doesn't necessarily sink a career".  Yeah right!  This kind of thinking puts one in jail 
 I am both a veteran and an indie film-maker (though I have not yet worked with a budget like this one had).  These are two facets that do have a bearing on my perspective, but they do not make me any less capable of recognizing virtue or merit - at least no less than others who write reviews.  Unlike many of the clearly strident and biased reviews writtenhave indicated, I feel that comedy and horror are visceral in nature, and that one's political and philosophical inclinations are separate factors which intrudes rather than enhances the nature of the sensations, though it is often hard for some to separate them.  Doing my best to review Homecoming objectively, I have to say it really wasn't a good film or story.  It wasn't scary or clever or entertaining or even very interesting.  It was mainly just a one-dimensional political rant where a horror film should have been, a dark comedy/satire which wasn't all that funny (granted, I am not an easy laugh), and campy B-movie propaganda where a clever story could have been told and presented.  One thing that does bother me is the hypocrisy that Dante and the other partisan screechers ultimately flaunt: they don't really care anything about those who serve this nation generally, or in a time of war specifically.  Neither he nor or other liberal "cultural elitists" who are so proud of themselves respect or appreciate what those who serve this country (let alone in wartime) go through and could not understand nor care less about their reasons for service.  Like many of their ilk (including the fatuous Matt Damon), they think those in the military do so because of a lack of options/money/education/etc.  To then presume to speak on the behalf of those who gave their life is not only disingenuous, but shameless.  I spent much of my career serving under a President (Clinton) whose attitude towards the military and its members was one of indifference at best and disdain the rest of the time.  What actually bothers me the most about this is Joe Dante being considered "a Master of Horror".  If any of those who raved about the "message" of this film had could put down your protest signs and Greenday posters and stop patting yourself on the back for a moment to examine the question honestly, you would have to admit to yourself that Joe Dante really didn't belong in a list of horror icon directors (besides The Howling, he just doesn't have the resume').  I realize that many of the stories and directors in this series have a political axe to grind, but at least John Carpenter and Dario Argento have earned their place among the Horror genre's esteemed (and I thought the vignette Cigarette Burns was really good, though I was a huge fan of In The Mouth of Madness, which it reminded me of).  Truth be told, you don't have to be a conservative or Republican to dislike this film.  And being a strident, ham-fisted propagandist doesn't make Joe Dante a good horror film-maker, let alone a legend in the Horror film genre.    
 The movie is really trash. The movie starts out showing Joe Dallesandro's [rear] and Geri Miller go-go dancing naked. Later on in the movie we meet Holly Woodlawn a trash collector who is a transvestite and a former prostitute. More graphic nudity and sex come up when Jane Forth and her husband come in the story. An all right beginning,middle, and end but the story is terrible 
 In recent years, Routledge has gone from consistently producing excellent language courses to producing some excellent courses and some bad courses. Unfortunately, Colloquial Catalan is a prime example of the very worst Colloquial courses.   The main error in this course is the fact that it's exceptionally limited. After completing some of the more extensive Colloquial courses, you will master the grammar of the language and have a solid basic vocabulary. Colloquial courses like Colloquial Italian, Colloquial Czech, Colloquial Albanian or Colloquial Icelandic list over 2000 words. The average Colloquial courses list 1000-1500 words. In sharp contrast, Colloquial Catalan doesn't even reach 600 words!   In my opinion, the Colloquial courses are often a better option than Teach Yourself courses, but that's not the case with Catalan. Teach Yourself Catalan will teach you more than twice as much as Colloquial Catalan. 
 I enjoyed this brilliant film, it must be one of the finest I ever seen. The political framework of this long and complex story is perfectly detected thanks to its modern setting: the '30s in Europe are the most well-chosen time for the Richard's dictatorship. The all-star cast is perfect and each of them hits the target 
 Another idiotic fantasy book by the conman Joseph smith.  How any rational person can believe any of the garbage spewed by this conman is beyond me.  It is appalling that there are people who buy into his ridiculous lies.  this book is as stupid as his other books, the book of Moron and the Doctrine and covenants.  It is patently absurd that god or angels spoke only to him after several centuries of heavenly silence.  Right....this 1820's glass looker, story teller, and pervert is a prophet??  Give me a break.  If the man were alive today doing what he did when he lived, he would be in prison.  Oh yeah, he would also be registered as a sex offender.    If you want to read a good book, try Grant Palmer's An Insider's View of Mormon Origins.  If you REALLY want this book, ask a mormon to lend you theirs.  They will jump at the chance to lend or give you their copy to try to get you indoctrinated into their absurd cult 
 We purchased this for our 7 year old for Christmas. It took three hours to put together. After all of that work, it fell apart everytime the least little bit of pressure was put on it or we tried to move it from the floor to a table. I was even extra careful after the first fall apart incident. We were so fustrated that we even tried to super glue the larger sections together so that our son could get some play time out of it but that didn't even work!! It looks wonderful on the box but after weeks of it falling apart, it is in a box in the attic 
 Isn't it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem-to which you say, "Yeah! yeah! That's me!" and then gives you no answer, or a weak one to which you say, "No duh!" I'm afraid this book is one of them. The title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you've only dreamed of, or at least point you in the right direction to get started! But I was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that God gives us desires that we can't have on earth so that we will long for Him and Heaven. I don't believe that's the abundant life Jesus promised. So I went to the Bible. (I should have gone there first!) I looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer. "Delight yourself IN THE LORD and He WILL give you the desires of your heart!" Ps. 37:4 So I set out to seek Him. I started reading "Knowing God" by J.I. Packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire! I hope you'll find them too-in Him 
 This woman is no biblical scholar. She does not need to worry. I am sure she will never be mistaken for a Proverbs 31 woman.  Egalitarians make a case that the man is not over the woman in the home--that was a result of the fall. Yet, we wear clothing as a result of the fall; yes, we are under the New Covenant through Jesus, but we still wear clothing. We sin as a result of the fall; under the New Covenant we still sin. Women have pain in childbirth as a result of the fall; women still have pain in childbirth, today, under the New Covenant. Yes, the man is the head over the woman in the home as a result of the fall, and he is STILL the ordained covering, leader, and head over the woman and the home under the New Covenant.  One thing these women such as this author conveniently dismiss is that women will want to rule over men as a result of the fall.  At least this book was worth reading for me (and worthy of one star), because it reinforced my traditional beliefs and made me want to have nothing to do with the egotistical spirit at work in the feminist movement of pride, and power and control. 
 As many other listeners had written, I am a great fan of Neal's music. But the latest effort I on U is a disappointing one. Neal is a tremendous guitar player, I have advocated this fact even while he was playing second fiddle to Santana from 1970-72 and later with Journey. Then of course he had a memorable stint with Jan Hammer in the 80's. I on U is unlike Neal's earlier solo efforts namely Electric World & Beyond the Thunder. Even the album Voice incorporating some popular hits sounded much better. In the current CD, Neal's guitar melody is there throughout, I think it's the instrumentation that suffers particularly the percussion & keyboards. It sounds so unnatural & contrived. Neal is basically a rock guitarist & to see him indulge in an album like this finds him like a fish out of water 
   DIS GY IS DA KYING OF DA SOUTH!!!   Give me a f***ing break. When are we going to stop seeing crappy rapper after even crappier rappers that are so full of themselves that they feel the need to plasture their faces all over every one of their crappy unintelligent so called albums!! Nothing descent to say at all, just a bunch of mindless [...]. I bet you they don't even like music, they just want to be a "celebrity"  and be rich for 3 years(till their broke). If they really did geniunly like music, it wouldn't sound that sh**y!!!! GET OVER YOURSELVES!!!  
 I have always enjoyed the style and much of the content of Greeley's books, and this is no exception. However, at this stage in my short life I have found it tiresome to hear his repeated talk about "stupid bishops" and the lack of pastoral care in the RCC. Is it true that some leaders lack the skills to lead? Yes, of course. But it just gets old when every book of Greeley's has to beat the same drum. I should know by now that every book of his has backhanded comments about the errors, or supposed errors, of the RCC, but what can I say? I am a glutton for punishment. (It is the former Lutheran in me.) In his defense, and it is a work of fiction, he does show that it is a minority of priests who commit these crimes and that it is statistically just as prevalent in any other profession that puts adults with children unsupervised.  OK, that said, the plot is half about rapist priests/scandal/litigation/cover-ups, etc. He does a great job bringing this to life. The other part of the book is a flashback to childhood and young adulthood, mostly concerning his growing romantic attachment to a female friend and the complications that brings as he struggles with his possible and actual vocation. Not bad, but not too interesting to me either.  What I found totally disgusting, and full of hypocrisy, was the last chapter of the book where he puts the full blame of the mess the Church is in NOT on the molesting and rapacious priests, but on those who covered it up! He says the priests are unable to control their urges, and thus are to be pitied. This is sick, to say the least. It is the other priests and bishops and cardinals who turn a blind eye that are to be blamed, in his view. Of course they are indeed guilty. But to let the offenders off? That alone earns the book a one star. 
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 This is one of the worst books I have read in a long time. I had to force myself to finish it, mostly because the storyline was a slight bit interesting and I wanted to know "whodunnit," but there were so many distractions to that storyline that it was frustrating. I think the book would be half the size if it would stick to the investigation (it IS a murder mystery, isn't it?) Entire chapters were spent pining over his ex-wife, his shrink appointments and his drinking and his new girlfriend (a very promiscuous high school principal??? pul-ease!) A lot of unnecessary foul language (even the principal), gratuitous sex and alcohol abuse. And that's just the hero of the story! Even the underaged prostitution that Jesse was investigating didn't bother me as much as the rest of it did. If it hadn't been a library book, I would have thrown it in the trash. I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it 
 The people giving this DVD set 5-star ratings very doubtfully OWN the set.  They are just giving the episodes 5 stars (which they DO deserve).  However, I bought this back in July of 2006 and all is not well.  Can someone who bought it more recently tell me if the sound issues have been fixed?  I returned this item for a refund and won't be buying it again until Paramount fixes the sound issues.  And, I am NOT some audiophile who needs everything to be perfect...just enjoyable.  Parts of the show are very quiet; I had to turn the sound up to even make out the dialog.  Then, a loud part comes on and almost blows my speakers.  This happens multiple times per episode.  Repeat this for six hours.  If I wanted this kind of quality, I'd just download the episodes off the Internet.  There will be a gap in my collection until this is fixed.  I don't know why they can't pay someone $5.15 an hour to watch the DVD once before they make 10 million copies.  Paramount will probably never fix this because nobody is admitting that there is a problem.  These glowing reviews on a subpar product are really heartbreaking 
 hi my name is alicia i am a high school senior and had to read this book i had to tell a summary and i could not how could i tell a summary of letters plays and her thoughts i needed help and if there is anyone out there  reading it for school i would not recommend you read it at all its good but  not that good to get a F fo 
 Read this book years ago as part of a graduate class, Yale University. I benefitted  because I was aware of the book and it's content...helpful should I hear about it in the future.  NOW...2007...there have been a series of groups and individuals who have used this novel as a bible for how to do something harmful to others...several in prison for their actions.  The DaVinci Code...the Turner Diaries...Think About It 
 The focus of the book seems to be how to try every snake oil solution first, add in a lot of prayer and then seek help from qualified ABA therapists. It is informational and a good read - for what NOT to do. Try - 'Overcoming Autism' as your first book - Lynn Koegel and Claire LaZebnik. I give it two stars since it doesn't really educate how to approach autism so much as how NOT to approach autism 
 This is awful! The female characters seem to have no direction of their own.  Lindsay accepts her boyfriend, Todd taking charge of her life as  readily as she accepts being raped by a wealthy businessman who randomly  breaks into her apartment, rapes her, and is content to leave as soon as  she tells him she will have his baby. Her doctor feels that he has the  right to get into her files without permission due to his previous  knowledge of her, and she simply accepts this. One particularly disturbing  scene is a memory of Lindsay's father beating her severely for a childish  outburst at the age of 11, followed by Lindsay's holding her father's hand  to her heart in remorse.  The only man in this story who doesn't believe  that he has a right to interfere with the lives of these women is Lindsay's  husband John Henry - and he's in a coma.  This is the most depressing book  I've ever read in my life. Reading it is a life sentence 
 Jeff Buckley sounds like what Marc Bolan would have sounded like if Bolan had taken Perry Como as his musical muse.  Seriously, think about Marc Bolan trying to sound like a '50's crooner and you'll know what Jeff Buckley sounds like 
 I have ordered from here before and haven't had a problem but this time I never received the item.  I ordered it for a class that I was taking so I could do a report on motivating employees and I never got the book so I just ended up doing it on something else.  I wouldn't have given any stars if that would of been on there 
 We bought this book for our 3 year old daughter for a flight as a "convenient" way to carry a bunch of puzzles in one book. She liked the book well enough, but there is one major problem: the puzzles that are embedded in the pages of the book don't stay in the book. As a result, if you finish one puzzle and turn the page to go to the next puzzle, it is pretty likely that the just-completed puzzle from the previous page will spill all over the place. This flaw makes the book completely useless almost immediately (at least in its book form). The only real remedy is to put the puzzle pieces in containers once you are done, which basically defeats the point of the book format.  The puzzles are nice and pretty, but be prepared for frustration when the completed puzzles don't stay in the book 
 I really like Clive Barker movies, but this one isn't that great. It lacked in many areas and didn't explain much at all about what was going on. The movie ended and all I said was "What?". I thought I would watch the special features and deleted scenes for the hell of it. I learned quiet a bit about what the movie was suppose to be after watching the deleted scenes. I don't know what the director was thinking when he deleted all of those important scenes, but it did fill in a lot of spaces about the movie. I still felt like there was no punch or excitement to the movie though.  My guess would be is that this is another example of the director chopping and cutting the original writer's script and making a mess out if it. On the other hand, cutting all of those scenes could make for yet another DVD release being an "uncut and unrated" version. If you want suspense, I would advise you to pass on this one. If you want to see for curiosity sake, then rent it. I am very disappointed in this one 
 I think this book would appeal most to folks searching for a dog with little knowledge of the breeds themselves.  I won this book and paid little attention to it for a long time. When I finally browsed through it, I was shocked to find that the breed information given about "my" breed (Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs) is almost 100% incorrect.  The breed history is inaccurate, the breed standards are misstated and the personality traits are totally wrong.  It seems like Mr. Dibra didn't even do cursory research on the breed before writing a summary about it.   I'm not as familiar with many other breeds, but did find some glaring inaccuracies about others as well.  Please research breeds through nationally accredited breed websites. If you want to research a breed or breeds, don't trust this book as an accurate source of information.  I'm sure Mr. Dibra is an expert on dog training, but he obviously is no expert on breeds or types. 
 Even thou I'm a professional Interior Decorator, this book doesn't give me much info I don't already know, also the colour samples are missing the manufacturer names and numbers to be found in stores. Yet the credits do mention which companies were used.  Everyday home decorator won't find any help from this one.  Two stars for the pretty pictures 
 I am sorry, but I do not share the rosy opinion of the particular book left by the other reviewers.  Lutzer pretends to offer an objectives survey of the doctrines he discusses, but in actuality he merely argues for his own biases.  His arguments for Calvinism are particularly weak.  There are many fine surveys of Christian doctrine for one to choose from; this is not one of them 
 I cannot agree with previous reviewers that this cd is in the same class as "Blow By Blow" or "Wired". Sorry, Jeff, this is lame. Sometimes you just need to know when to hang up the axe 
 I've never written a review before, but I'm compelled in this case.  I expected better, and not just because the name of Cheever sets a high standard.  Two big problems:  1) Susan hasn't done her homework.  2) The quality of the writing is poor. I've actually only gotten to page 48 in two weeks because I'm so disspirited - and the whole Concord scene is one of my favorite topics.  I live in Massachusetts, and have taken the standard tours of the Old Manse and Alcott's house, and Emerson's house a number of times. The docents on the tours have different information than Susan does.  Here's an example.  Emerson's favorite excuse for being late to church was that he had mislaid his gloves.  It was for that reason that Thoreau built a special glove drawer for him.  It was not for Lidian, as Susan stated on page 39.  Did Susan not visit Emerson's house? Susan also mentions several times that Emerson changed his second wife's name from Lydia to Lidian. It seems odd that, since she thinks it important enough to mention several times, she doesn't say why he did that.  Again, the tour docents, as part of their normal spiel, say that it's because the two vowels coming together (end of Lydia, beginning of Emerson) was awkward to pronounce. Simple. Why hold that back? Also, Plymouth is not on Cape Cod (page 23). It's on the mainland.  It IS on the shore of Cape Cod BAY, however, but that's different. Check out MapQuest, Susan. To my second point above: I'm having to read many sentences over and over again to figure out what Susan means.  There are many characters to keep straight, so there's a need for the author to be very clear whenever she uses "he" and "she."  And Susan doesn't.  It's just infuriating.  She'll refer to both Emerson and Thoreau in a sentence, for instance, and then start the next sentence with "He."  Arghhhh.  Here's an example of confusion (page 21). "There had been many boarders at the Thoreaus' house over the years, but Lucy Brown's aloneness in the world with her son and daughter had captivated him (whom? What preceeds this is a poem.). She (Lucy, I presume) was a literary woman of a certain age on a protracted visit to her sister Lidian, who had married the local sage, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and moved (who moved - Lucy or Lidian?) into a big square white house (shouldn't there be commas somewhere in there? ) with him (whom? Thoreau? Emerson?) on the other side of town." What a mess.  I'm also puzzled by the organization of the book.  In the introductory note to the reader, she explains the structure, but I find it just a mish-mash.  Sorry I can't be more positive. Susan needs to go back to writing school.  Or to start going.     
 I got this toy for my one of my triplet sons for his 5th birthday, and I am appalled that I paid $50 for such a poorly made product.  They say it "transforms" into the batmobile - that is a joke!  You have to take most of it apart to get it to fold back up, so why bother with that "feature" in the first place?  The whole thing is made terribly.  It barely stands upright, and the little plastic chains that suspend the one set of platforms keep coming off the little plastic hooks.  None of my boys play with it, and now I am stuck with it because I don't have the box anymore to return it.  Bottom line:  this was a complete waste of money 
 Parts of this story are entertaining, but parts of it tended to bother me.  What really bothered me was that Harriet did some mean things to people in her class, but her nanny never told her that what she did was wrong.  She seemed to tell Harriet to pretend to be sorry, even if she wasn't sorry.  That attitude is what really bothers me about the movie and the book 
 I had heard good things about the author's work before but had not read any myself.  I came away disappointed.  There are flashes of great insight at times and the author is obviously smart and well read.  But after a  while it becomes clear that convincing the reader of those two points is  the author's main aim.  The book makes readers embarrassed for not knowing  the details of 18th century, obscure texts, and the author dismisses the  work of other leading political theorists with one line throw away  sentences.  I forced myself to finish, but in the end, I agreed with  Melbourne that the work is fundamentally tedious and self-indulgent 
 There's very little in this book you couldn't learn from one of the free PDF downloads on the Daily Racing Form website.  It's an introduction to what happens in and around the track that doesn't help you at all with learning how to handicap.  Strictly lowest common denominator stuff, nothing that will help you think for yourself at the track.  You'd be better off picking up a copy of Brad Free's brilliant Handicapping 101 instead-- This one falls far below the usual Dummies standards 
 The premise of this story started off smartly. I was drawn in as a reader as Case set up an unusaul plot where the protagonist is in Russia to cover a minor story only to be pushed aside while his sources of information are taken away. But from this point onwards the story becomes painfully predictable as time after time Case takes the predictable rout. Finally the story completely falls apart and it was like when you watch one of those really bad action flicks where the hero saves the day time after time and its so stupid that you get a bad headache.   I have read one other Case book I think, his "Kingdome Come" that was written under a psudo name, or maybe Case is the psudo name, I'm not sure. But what I am trying to say here is that 'Kingdome Come' was much better than 'First Horseman.' Its still a little corny, but it reads like a more contemporary Ludlum 
 It started out promising - the perils of  present day Rio- but then it turns into a very messy history book. It's full of interesting facts and it inspires  a great reading list, but it was a real chore to finish. A rambling romp through Brazil's sexy and horrible history. 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 What a lot of self-centered, pompous baloney!  McCort must have got his drinking buddies to write many of the deliriously exuberant rave reviews here.  Luckily I didn't pay a cent for this thing, which is still more than it's worth.  Library audio book.  Phooey 
 It took so long I had forgotten I had ordered it and almost bought it at a book store! Beyond that, the cover was horribly bent and torn, it was yellow, the spine was nearly shattered from use, and it wasnt even the same edition I ordered! Ugh 
 I'll give it to Kyle, he has the education level and maturity to be a Worldnetdaily columnist.  That isn't saying much since he is in the ranks of McCarthyist Ann Coulter, racist junkie Rush Limbaugh and professional liar Sean Hannity.  Kyle takes the conservative party line about evil liberals, a left-wing media conspiracy, degraded education system and a plot by homosexuals and rehashes it with unimaginative, unoriginal predictability.  The author's claim of in-depth research is paramount to turning on the 700 Club, listening to hours of right wing radio, and drowning himself into the paranoid delusions of Fox News.  Being a young author and columnist isn't much of an accomplishment when all you to is paraphrase your conservative peers 
 J. Michael Veron apparently sat down to write The Greatest Player Who Never Lived in the same manner a trial lawyer would write a closing argument.  He tells us what he's going to say, then he says it, then he sums up what he just said.  There was very little tension in the story, only piles of documents to sift through along with the main character.  It is at times laborious reading with a pleasant twist at the end.  Golf fanatics and lawyers (who play golf) will enjoy it.  Otherwise skip this tiresome read 
 I wanted to give it only one star but maybe it's a little better than the original...but I can't really tell much difference.  It still goes down by the end of the day and I don't like the bulge. Oh well, it's only $15. It was worth a chance... 
 I ordered I Love Lucy Seceond Season in August, but as of today HAVE NOT received my merchandise.This item was NOT out stock, so I am confused as to the delay, since all other products I have ordered from Amazon have arrived in a timely manner.Also ordering certain items on Amazon, have been MOST difficult in finding the correct merchandise that I want.  Also I had to return damaged merchandise, and so far have heard NOTHING on my order, refund, or any communication from Amazon.Right now, I have to say I am somewhat disappointed in Amazon.Cheryl Henninge 
 This is a difficult book to categorize. It is well written, contains many interesting anecdotes, but it misses the essential Orwell.  Taylor's gloomy, otherwordly, ex-Etonian, ex-imperial policeman simply does not add up to Orwell. The sum of the parts is much less than the man. Taylor's book is a bit like an autopsy, the pathologist clearly never being able to comprehend the stiff, dead flesh and bottled samples before him as the full human being they were. Nevertheless, autopsies do tell interesting tales.   Orwell's gloomy temperament puts him not outside the mainstream of writers but exactly in the company of so many important writers. The list of writers with some form of depression, whether alcoholism or gloominess, is so huge - Greene, Swift, Hemingway, Le Carré, Dickens, Gissing, O'Neill, Twain, Faulkner, etc, etc. - one comes to think of the quality almost as a job requirement. It provides one of the special lens through which critical writers see the world. One has to believe Taylor understands this, but his book conveys only clinical observations of gloominess snipped from letters, diaries, and conversations.    As far as Orwell's otherworldliness, Orwell was clearly in the great tradition of English eccentrics, and that is an important component of his appeal. There is a long and glorious line of them from Dr. Johnson and Jane Austen down to Alec Guinness, Margaret Rutherford, and Vanessa Redgrave. Yet Taylor only offers clinical observations and never puts them in their proper context.  Orwell was not an important novelist, so it seems a bit gratuitous to say so as Taylor does. In fact, he wasn't even a very good novelist. Yet books like Keep the Aspadistra Flying do provide a keen sense of his Englishness. Missing entirely from Taylor's autopsy is a sense of Orwell's quintessential Englishness. When Orwell writes of getting back to the feel of heavy English coins and having mahogany tea, readers get a sense of pure distilled Englishness. This comes through also in quasi-journalistic books like The Road to Wigan Pier or Down and Out in Paris and London - important early efforts at what today might be called investigative journalism - books which Taylor rather disparages both in terms of Orwell's re-arranging actual events and being an observer mentally wearing an Eton tie.  What Orwell was is a critic, and a rather magnificent one. I am reminded of Degas' description of Monet as "Only an eye, but what an eye!"   Orwell had an exquisite sense of justice and a very sensitive barometer for tyranny plus he had the words to convey vividly his sensibilities. Taylor virtually misses this in his examination of bile and stool samples. Taylor too often puts Orwell's political criticism down to miss-directed, soft-Left thinking of an ex-Etonian. Orwell himself recognized the simpering nature of much of the Left's views, yet he struggled bravely with finding a vocabulary to accommodate his sympathies. He possibly did not come to recognize himself for what he was, a scorching critic of both Left and Right. After all, his time was short. That is how it is when you die in your forties.  He was also an important literary critic, and while Taylor recognizes this, I don't believe he gives it a full enough examination.  Taylor sadly drags out the subject of anti-Semitism, perhaps the most overly-used epithet of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. If Orwell was anti-Semitic - and I do not believe this for a second - it was in the same vague sense of virtually all Englishmen of his time. The English have always had a degree of xenophobia, a quality whose obverse side is the very set of qualities defining Englishness. I am tired of discussions of whether Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice makes the greatest playwright in human history anti-Semitic, discussions which always ignore the human qualities and sense of justice Shakespeare gives his character, and just so, Orwell, overall a truly decent man.  There has been a good deal of writing in recent years about Orwell, much of it wrong-headed, from claims being made that he would have supported Bush's invasion of Iraq (!) to sentimentality. Little of it captures Orwell the independent and remarkably clear-thinking critic. Taylor gives us no sense of what it was that animated Orwell, other than some almost silly stuff about getting back at people like the headmistress of his school. There is almost a sense in this book of a high-class hatchet job done on Orwell, but I don't want to push that point. What makes Orwell truly important is minimized, and what wasn't important is given a good deal of weight. Perhaps that is the fate of great critics who support no one's ideologies and preconceptions.   This book should be read only with an awareness of its limited approach to the subject. This is not Orwell, but a somewhat interesting display of bits and memorabilia in museum cabinets.  Please see my review of Gordon Bowker's Orwell biography, a superior work (published in the same year) in most respects to Taylor's.    
 The objects and images in Mutter Museum are obviously fascinating and I can see that even though most of the photographs of them in this book are truly tiresome.   To quote another review I read on the book "the archival photos from ...the Mutter's storage rooms that are the real treasures here.... In spite of their generally more clinical nature, these photographs of patients and odd medical conditions often achieve a level of artistry equal to the efforts of the featured contemporary photographers. "   I disagree. The old clinical photographs are far more interesting than the " featured contemporary photographers" Why? Because the ' featured contemporary photographers' just tried to hard to be interesting. They didn't let that objects etc speak for themselves. I don't need to see the photographers pet dog posed with the human foot in a jar. I don't want to look at the 'infant skeleton with club feet' with its feet artfully cut out of the frame. I want to look at a photograph of something as interesting a preserved head in focus...not shot in a meaningful out of focus way 
 I was intrigued by "The Replaement Killers." After seeing "The Professional" I became interested in the premise of a hit man with a heart. That the movie chose not to take this route was the first of many disappointments. It turns out that the hit man isn't really a professional at all. Instead he is killing in order to save his family. The first two killings went flawlessly, but when he is assigned to kill a child rather than criminals he can not bring himself to do it. That too is an interesting premise, albeit a much more familiar one, and it raises a separate set of questions: Why did he get involved with the crime-boss? If he has only killed two people how did his skill become so remarkable?      However, I must admit that I rented this because I felt a little blood-thirsty tonight and by the end it was definately quenched. It's just a shame that it didn't answer some very important questions. It did EARN its one star, I was moderately entertained but I felt two stars was too generous 
 From my experience, these kind of healing books don't work well to change my feelings and attitudes. They do have temporary effects, but do not last long. This book also was not the execption. There are many "Things To  Do" which I should do right now to change my life. But I don't and  can't. Always when I read such kind of books, I am firm about trying to do  these "Things". But I don't take a whim for reading these kind of  books again and thus I lose an opportunity to do good "Things"  entirely. I think volunteering for building GESUNDHEIT INSTITUTE in WEST  VIRGINIA and meet PATCH ADAMS is much more effective than reading this  book 
 I expected this to be a disaster movie in the Irwin Allen tradition. Instead, I find a movie too bizarre for words. I taped this movie off the Sci-fi channel and I missed the first 10 minutes, and I "came in" as a man and his wife were helping victims (which I'm guessing) of a volcanic eruption in Italy. She is killed as he loses his grip on her hand hovering over a lava stream. He continues to see her in his dreams and is haunted by his memory of her. He then proceeds to the Italian province where she'd grown up (before moving to the states) in search of her records, which I'm guessing is for closure. Instead he encounters a mute young girl who has been declared as "disturbed," who seems terrified of him -- and yet, seems drawn to him and pursues him -- and leaves him dead animals as "gifts." Everyone he meets warn him to stay away from her and the area where she is staying and offering no explanation. He follows her to a cave where, after experiencing a swarm of bats that drop dead out of the air as they reach him, he sees she has candles lit and she draws circles everywhere. And after chasing her to someplace else, he sees that she has drawn a detailed picture of his late wife. After demanding from her how she knows her, she flees. He is then told by others that after a traumatic event in her young life, she became mute, communicates only with the dead and feels a possible connection to the Devil. At this point, I turned off this movie and watched no more of it, even though I was at the half-way mark. What all this has to do with a volcano is beyond me. At least the movie "Nature Unleashed: Earthquake" had that Irwin Allen feel to it as it focused on the disaster; here I wasted about an hour out of my life, scratching my head after the first 45 minutes. My advice: avoid this movie and read a book 
 I first read the Dance Hall of the Dead in high school.  Being a member of the Zuni Tribe, and a resident of the town of Zuni, it was quite interesting to see how much of the information concerning Zuni could be changed to fit the "theme" and plot of the book.  While these may seem like little details to most people, it is quite disturbing to see how often Hillermans work is seen as accurate, because of a reputation he has somehow gained as an "expert" on Native Cultures of the American Southwest.  Apparently, he thought that all pueblo people are the same.  This is evident in the use of the last name of Cata, which is not even seen in Zuni, and is actually a last name seen only in the Rio Grande Pueblos.  In addition, his interpretation or portrayal of the Sha'la'k'o ceremony as a "Dance Hall of the Dead" is simplistic at best.  While he may be an "expert" in Navajo culture, it does not qualify him to comment on a COMPLETELY different society, much less its sacred and complex kachina ceremonies.  Finally, many native people, such as the Navajo, the Zuni and the Hopi (who have all been "featured" in Hillerman's books) feel that Hillerman's descriptions of ceremonies and rituals is just plain wrong.  As an outsider, he has no business delving into or exposing the nature of such things as kachinas, which we consider sacred yet dangerous.  Furthermore, by exploiting our cultures for the sake of adding interest to a plot, he seems to show a lack of respect for our cultures, our religions, and our tribes in general.   This in itself is bad enough, but the worst thing is that people actually consider his novels definitive descriptions of Native culture.  There are many ethnological works out there that are available, and they are NOT hard to find.  After all Zuni is one of, if not THE most complex, and most studied society on earth.  While I don't agree with people wanting to know "everything there is to know" about Zuni culture, there are much better places to find out about "us" than a Tony Hillerman book 
 The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money 
 I waited to read this book and was totally disgusted with it. It was more of a history about her mother (who was no doubt certifiable). Ms Wood dedicated her life, for good or for bad, to the Screen. The least this author could have done was not to  write it like someone was standing over his shoulder! 
 Ok, Perhaps the recipes are great, but unlike his other books with great illustrations, I might have just picked up a world dictionary that doesn't entise the imagination.  Again, the recipes are most likely wonderful, but when it comes to cookbooks, I prefer ones that are visual and tantilizes all my sences when reviewing a meal 
 It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better 
 In Momaday's Pulitzer Prize winning novel "House Made of Dawn," a young Native-American Indian named Abel, returns to Walatow Reservation in New Mexico from World War II. Only to discover that he is caught between two worlds. This book is a great example of Native-American fiction, it reveals the hardships of the Native-Americna people. Anyone who loves a good book based on storytelling and myth will find this book a must-read. It draws the reader in, with it's vivid description of the landscapes and ceremonies. At first I was a bit apprehensive in reading this book, because I have been told this is not a good book to read if you're reading Momaday's work for the first time. Yet, I enjoyed reading it, I apprieciated Momaday's effort to draw the reader in with the struggle of Native-American Indians living in industrial America. I recommend this book to anyone who is in search of a good book 
 If you think you'd find a lot of unrelated platitudes interesting, then you'll enjoy this book. 
 Matt Dillon was seriously mis-cast in this film. He came across as an unlikable, hopelessly plebian, crotch-scratching "dese, dem, and doze" low-class slob, while the lovely Annabella Sciorra seemed urbane, literate, and softly spoken. One wonders how these two ever got together in the first place. For people who supposedly grew up in the same neighborhood, the speech patterns are noticably at odds, with Dillon's character coming out at the bottom. The premise was predictable, the main character unlikeable, and the ending unbelievable. The supporting cast, however, was superb, considering what they were given to work with. Vincent D'Onofrio is wonderful as the shy pharmacist, Sciorra is a beautiful and engaging ex-wife to Dillon, and Mary Louise Parker comes across as a much better match for Dillon's character than Sciorra. If you want a good romantic movie, see Happy Accidents instead. Review refers to the VHS Tape editio 
 This tape seems to be a compilation of leftover skits that weren't deemed good enough for regular python shows.  The only truly funny one was the Airline Pilots sketch, and John Cleese's intros.  Only for diehard Python fans 
 we bought this as a cheap/easy stocking stuffer. It's simply not woth anything.  The little file is a good idea, but too tiny to actually work.  My daughter (8yrs old) liked the idea too, but was sad that she couldn't work with the tiny strip that's too short for even her little fingers. Cute, but not worth it 
 This is the most ovhyped paltry piece of corporate garbage that has been my displeasure to enter my ears. -_-  This album is terrible... not much more to say then that.  The muscianship is terrible, the lyrics are more cheesy than you'd believe possible.  I mean come on with a title like Let Love In you can basically tell this is the epitimy of all sellout albums.  About anything up to before A boy named Goo is great with ACTUAL LYRICS!!!  Plus its not a snoozefest they all have great songs to listen to!  Guess its bands like this that keep the greedy corporate machine running.  BTW: If you like this cd you dont like Goo Goo Dolls, you like the corporate machine, this is not Goo Goo Dolls.  Just about anything is better than this but i'd reccomend Disturbed Old Metallica (up to the black album which is mediocre) 3 doors down (again up to 17 days or w/e it is) Breaking Benjamin- Awesome band, 3 albums and an EP all EXCELLENT songs Staind- To a point with this band some of their cd's are a bit mediocre Click Five- Lol completely mainstream but i find it hilarious in its mediocrity =D  Small Sins- Great band, Alternative Rock.  Has great lyrics Snow Patrol=best..alternative...band...ever Relient K- Awesome just awesome All their cds are awesome 12 Stones-First cd's i ever bought and still my favorite of all, Great Solid Rock Cd 
 I was expecting this to be a professional DVD like any normal band would put out, not a collection of bootlegs. Like everyone else, I agree, the DVD is terrible. The sound quality is horrible. The guys act like they're 12 years old. Its not worth buying unless you want a collection of miserable sounding bootlegs. 
 As the reviews below indicate, "Arthur" has a lot of fans -- when it was released in 1981 Vincent Canby of the New York Times found it a wonderful "screwball comedy" (although over time, Times readers, perhaps more discerning than Vincent, have only rated it 3 out of 5 stars) and Bravo listed it #10 on its list of Best Comedies (see below). I first saw Dudley Moore in "Foul Play," thought he was very funny. Based upon that, I bought "10" and "Arthur," as it turned out a downward trajectory.  What I dislike about "Arthur" is Moore playing a loud, obnoxious drunk telling unfunny jokes, and Minelli playing a salt-of-the-earth working girl who loves Arthur for himself, not for his $750 million fortune. Even John Gielgud, who was great in "The Loved One" a much better comedy, can't resurrect this turkey.  Okay, folks. Start casting your negative votes. In the meantime, here's the Bravo 100 Best Comedies list:  100. Anchorman  99. The Birdcage  98. School of Rock  97. Happy Gilmore  96. Four Weddings and a Funeral  95.

 Don't waste your money!! I would give it a zero if I could 
 I hope her knowledge of American Indian culture is sounder than her grasp of English history. I spotted some howlers, several repeated in the text: King James "VII" of Scotland (make that James VI) was NOT Queen Elizabeth's nephew. Nor was Queen Elizabeth England's first Protestant monarch (the honours go to her brother Edward VI) I could go on, but you get the idea ... Read this one with a heaping tablespoonful of sal 
 I love Lang Lang and bought this CD specifically for that reason -- but I was very disappointed at the sound quality.  Usually Telarc has great recordings, but this one was the worst I have ever heard.  I was not able to finish listening to it.    What an awful way to showcase a major young talent 
 Dr. Sarno's concept is sound, but this is his first report, rather old.  There are two newer books, the best of which, of course, is the 2006 "The Divided Mind : The Epidemic of Mindbody Disorders", which I highly recommend.   
 Half of my pictures are out of focus making it useless.  Should have sent it back 
 I bought this book to get some ideas on how to use my new serger in sewing.  I was taken in by the subtitle of this book.    I was disappointed to find that this book is almost entirely about embellishments.  The embellishments are also things that I remember from years ago and aren't done much now.  I returned this book within days of receiving it as it was basically useless to me 
 I used this book in an OOA&D class I took several years ago, and it taught me absolutely nothing. The ideas are not organized in any particular order, there are no examples or illustrations of what the author is trying to convey, and there is some absolutely worthless software distributed with the book that is so useless you'll believe you're doing something wrong until you realize it is of such limited usefulness that it is basically an Excel spreadsheet with a poorly designed user interface.   This book was so useless to me that when the class was over, rather than donate it to a library or a friend, or just keep it for further reference, I instead decided to throw it in the garbage. This was because:  (a) I wouldn't want to burden the library or another human being with such a useless book. (b) If I kept it, it would be taking up valuable space on my bookshelf. Instead, allow me to recommend "Head First Object Oriented Analysis and Design" just recently published by O'Reilly and Associates. One reason I delayed writing this review was that I wanted to have something to guide people toward - such as the O'Reilly book - versus just ranting about how bad this book is.   P.S - On further review, I must apologize to the makers of Excel. Their spreadsheets are much more useful and versatile than the software included in this book. 
 Inquiring rhetorically, how can this otherwise well produced program not include the 1947 unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia, in Los Angeles? If the physical remains of her body don't constitute a bizarre murder, nothing does. 
 As Hemingway the Zen master said, "Some are hunters, some are not." Several Hemingway scholars have treid to explain EH's lifelong affinity for blood sports (notably Bredahl and Drake's 1990 exegesis of Green Hills Of Africa) -- this "package of Papa" is content to just push whole chunks and raw excerpts of Hemingway onto a marketing skewer without any comment.  Using "hunting" as a marketing criterion forces together the most flaccid posthumous Hemingway and some of his purest fiction and livliest reportage. It's obvious Hemingway wrote about hunting (and fishing) in the same sense the Homer wrote about Mediterranean tourism. Lazy readers may like the way this editor rearranged Hemingway's cabin furniture, but most of the writing actually seem the duller for being re-packaged to a less spontaneous purpose. Sad to see a great prose turned as a license for 'designer books,' and by his own kin. Some are artists, others are not 
 Hey, I love the West Coast, as well as California (hope to live there one day). I believe that they can come with the most creative hip hop in the game, and try to support anything that they do. But you do not know how mad I am at this album! When I heard The Dogg Pound was comming with a new album, I couldn't wait to cop it, because comming from some veterans from the west coast (my favorites I might add), I had HIGH expectations from this. This was a very dissapointing album. I guess the flaws are right in my face.   I really don't want to accept the fact that the West Coast fell off, and I keep beliving that they're going to get back on their feet, but this keeps sending me a few steps backwards. Basically the spotlight reviewer "Constant" made the perfect statement about this album. This trio's rhymes skills have been kinda bad lately like on the song "Sittin On 23's". It's like each member tries to rhyme, and they do okay at some points, but fail most of the time. Songs like "Hard On A Hoe" & "Fake***hoes" are just horrible. The album name "Cali Iz Active" you'd think that they would bring as many west coast artists on this album, but they didn't. Lady Of Rage, RBX, Nate Dogg, and Ice Cube appear on this, but the fact that David Banner, P. Diddy, Pall Wall are on this damages the albums image. Also as many reviewers have stated, they're rhyme style hasn't really changed since 1992. Now thats a huge problem.  There are some good tracks on this here, and when I say "good", I mean they barely pass as listenable. I believe the self titled track "Cali Iz Active" was a good one as well as how they brought all the artists from the west in for the video shoot, as I hoped that it would be like that on the album. Although many of the beats are not west coast like, they are still a little nodding like "Keep It Gangsta" although Lady Of Rage outshines Kurupt and Daz. "It's All Hood" is one of those "good" songs on here (as I meantioned what I meant by "good").  Overall, this is not a good album. To me this is a HUGE dissapointment. I denied my self and kept believing that this is a good album, but as I heard it over and over again, it got worse and worse. If anyone remembers when the West was on top of the rap game, knows that this is not the way you bring it back. New listeners, who are unfamiliar of it's domination might like this album. I can't accept this at all.

 It seems like Hard Core Logo is an example of a book that was not quiet as good as the film that was made out of it.  Perhaps I expected too much upon seeing the excellent film first, but I can't help but be disappointed with  the book.  It's novel in verse format is clever, although skimpy.  I feel  that Turner had a great story to tell, but left out all the best parts.   The characters are underdeveloped and the whole story feels empty and  unfulfilling.  It is a very short book (it took me about three times as  long to watch the movie than read the book), and while this is not  necessarily a bad thing, I felt that there had to be more in this book to  make it work.  A great idea, a great basis for a movie, this book is a bit  too hollow to be thoroughly enjoyed.  Check out American Whisky bar  instead, it's way better and a great book in itself 
 I wish I had done a little research on this book before reading it.  As it turned out when I was near the end of the book it struck me that I wish I hadn't bought or read it.  Undoubtedly the author is a talented writer and an impressive researcher, but the book's almost nonexistant focus on Chaplin as a filmmaker should be a caution to any reader.  Before getting to the bulk of the book I will point out the one positive aspect of the book.  Chaplin's childhood left me in awe.  To say that it was tough doesn't even come close, and I couldn't help thinking how lucky he was to rise from nothing to the succesful filmmaker that he became.  Then there is the rest of the story.    In the +500 pages of 'Tramp,' Joyce Milton concentrates on two aspects of Chaplin's life.  First, the author details the many sad and destructive relationships Chaplin had with his wives, mistresses, and countless others in Hollywood.  Almost no one comes out looking good in any of these relationships - not Chaplin or most of the women.  For about thirty years, until his marriage to Oona O'Neill, it is one tarnished and ruined experience after another.  Paulette Goddard is one of the few who comes out in any positive light.  And of Oona O'Neill, the one woman that Chaplin seemed to be able to have anything resembling a successful relationship, we end up learning the very least.    Second, the author dedicates an excessive amount of space on Chaplin's Marxists views.  The point is clear - it is the highest irony that a multimillionaire actor had such strong opposition to free enterprise.  A lot can be said of that, and Milton takes every opportunity to do so.  The endless cast of insigificant Communist sympathizers goes on and on.  What a boring lot they were!  Eventually I read over these parts with no care to retain any of the information.  In the end it was just plain tiresome.    It was largely surprising how little space Milton spent on Chaplin as a filmmaker.  Many of the chapter titles are Chaplin's own movie titles.  Yet, for example, in the nearly 30-page chapter 'City Lignts,' if you were to string together the few paragraphs that actually deal with the movie 'City Lights' you'd be lucky to put together 2 or 3 pages.  At the end of the book, Milton makes the point that if you want to know Chaplin as a filmmaker, watch his videos, they are readily available.  I second that - rent or buy his videos, skip this book 
 A customer asked me to give him a brief overview of nanotechnology. This book was not helpful. Full of hype, jargon and precious little technical information, the main focus seemed to be to convince the reader to run out and invest in nanotechnology or be hopelessly left behind. I paid $12.89 for the book on Amazon, read about half of it and took it to the used bookstore in my neighborhood. They offered me $2.00 for it and I grabbed the money, though I felt guilty for taking advantage of them 
 What I liked about this book is that it makes use of documents and materials from both the West and the Communist World.  It is an interesting mix and a fair look at both sides of the Cold War.  But there is the  problem as well.  Too much of the book and the evidence from both the US  and USSR at times contradict each other, while at other times supports each  other.  In short, the chapters are confusing.  Who is right?  Who is wrong?   For example their Cuban Missile Crisis chapters where interesting, but  heck if I can draw a conclusion as to what really happened.  Also, the  title.  The title is wrong.  It is clear that the US and the West one the  cold war.  I think that is an undisputed fact.  So again, the book has good  information, but it is at times too much.  The book is ultimately too much  info and not enough conclusions 
 Cheap Trick is undoubtedly one of the best live acts around today. They have such great stage charisma, top notch talent, and they consistently get better with age!  What other band sounds better 30 years later?  After my disappointment with the Special One CD, I was excited to hear about this DVD; I heard most Special One songs live, and couldn't understand why they translated to tape poorly.  Having these songs stripped and performed live would be exactly the hot product to put out.  And the songs DO sound much better now, such tremendous intensity Robin has live, the guitars and bass sound great, and there's a great build up to the climax of each song.  However, what's really the downer about this DVD is that although you get fun fictious anecdotes and silly interviews of the band between every track, you then get 2/3 of each live song.  NOT A SINGLE SONG APPEARS HERE IN ITS ENTIRETY.  It's like a Behind the Music (without drama or drugs) based around a new live show.  The banter is great, but this clip-show format KILLS the replay value of this disc.    The closest comparison I can give is the 2-DVD version of Silver, how the second DVD has fun clips and chat between tracks and then overlays into the songs.  That's exactly what this is like, however, you do not get the benefit of the complete uncut show.  Bonus features are fun, with the band and their families visiting Japan, although the two live special appearances they played are again not shown in their entirety.  Perhaps someday we'll get the Budakan show on DVD or an updated Every Trick in the Book DVD.  Update 6/14/05:  Exactly a year later, I've still yet to pop this into my DVD player for a second watch, and Cheap Trick's still my favorite band.  
 Yes, it IS rubbish.  And some people need to ACTUALLY... yes, I know this is a revolutionary concept for some lefties... need to ACTUALLY check out the facts before writing a review or criticizing someone else's review.  This author REALLY IS a TERRORIST.  LITERALLY.  It is a matter of PUBLIC RECORD.  He was a leader of the Weather Underground terrorist group in the sixties.  His group planted several bombs and blew things up.  To this day HE BRAGS ABOUT IT.  He says he wishes he could have planted even more bombs.  If you don't believe me, READ THE BOOK HE HIMSELF WROTE ABOUT IT.  It's available here on Amazon.  Freakin' morons.. 
 Ray Johnson is a virtually unknown figure of the Pop Art scene and his story is filled with interesting figures from New York at the time. Additionally his suicide puts a tragic spin on his biography. I was disappointed though once I saw that 'How to Draw a Bunny' was not going to let the viewer at the information so easily. What you do get is interesting enough but it comes with an soundtrack consisting of drum riffs that is engineered at the same level as the interviews which proved to be very distracting. About 30 minutes into the film I realized that I had yet to see any of Johnson's work in the film. When it does appear it is quickly cut, cropped, or shown in bits.   'HTDAB' does not suffer from lack of information. After a while, I got the feeling that the filmmaker had almost too much information and interviews often stray off unrelated to each other. I was left to wonder why some anecdotes went on for five minutes while other more interesting ones were cut off to quickly.  At times too much of a 'personal touch' interferes with the film. Why for instance do we need to see a re-creation of a valentine xerox work of Johnson? Was the filmmaker concerned that it might serve to undermine the actual work? Its not too much of a shame...you get the point of the film -and Johnson's collage and xerox work- rather quickly but the details that are supposed to be the meat of any documentary are downplayed by the garnish.  
 Shoddy. Cheap. Glue-bound. Spine-cracking.Short ribbon marker. Junk. But, inside this inferior piece of work lies one of the finest English translations of the last fifty years. However!! Customers be aware!: In Summer, 2005, I, and many others, received an e-mail asking for suggestions for changes, because the English Standard Version Translation Committee is now working on a revision already!!!! It will probably be out in 2007. Everything is pretty hush-hush. The egalitarian folks on a few websites are probably pushing for more inclusive language. So, maybe purchasing ANY ESV should wait until the revision appears. Back to this edition. The print is fairly large(12.75),a better font could have been chosen, and could be darker. The ribbon marker barely extends beyond the bottom page. The spine cracks easily in front and back(already sent one back to Crossway for this). It has book intros and a fairly concise Concordance. Most Crossway Bibles are garbage. HEY CROSSWAY!!  If you can't make a decent Bible, give the rights to folks who can and will!!!  As for me, I love the ESV, but I'm using real quality editions from Foundations Publications who do the NASB 
 If you like reading books by patronizing, snobbish, and self-important authors, then this is the book for you.  While I admit that I found some of it helpful with regards the basics of punctuation, I simply could not stomach Ms Truss's penchant for contemptuously bellittling anyone who was not as au fait with the correct use of the comma, apostrophe, semi-colon, etc., as she is.  In the end, I got so infuriated with her elitist, superior, and at times deeply offensive tone, that I ripped the book in half and consigned it to the recycle bin.  On the back jacket of my copy there are a number of quotations from reviews of this book.  One of them reads, 'Ms Truss makes [punctuation] a joy to contemplate'.  If you were to replace the word in brackets with 'toothache', I think you would be closer to the truth.  Teaching correct punctuation is important, I agree, but not at the expense of denigrating people who, for whatever reason, are less 'punctuation-savvy' than oneself 
 The Deni 6000 works good for only a few weeks before it fails dangerously. I have 2 units that did the exact same thing. One of the rotating blades breaks off and comes out with the ice. Fortunately for me I noticed it in my glass before eating it. Two units-identical failures. This machine is a potential safety hazzard. I will be contacting Deni about their defective design. If you use this ice crusher and it starts sounding louder than usual, one of your blades is probably bent and about to break off. Beware 
 A terrible script and the Rock's non existent acting skills make this little more then a Universal promo add for their theme park rides.  At least Kelly Hu has moved on to better movie roles 
 Having invested heavily in a single stock - WorldComm - Paulos laments his financial loss, and embarks to write a book where he takes the reader through a spectrum of equities analysis methodologies, and disproves their apparent success as attributes of illusions and perceptions. Through the use of thought experiments, he attempts to re-wire the readers to comprehend the true nature of randomness, which is more ordered than most people's expectations.   The good stuff aside, I am very disappointed with the book for two reasons. Firstly, the publisher's marketing of the book is highly misleading. It hints that the author used his professional skills as a mathematician to beat the market. As such I bought the book hoping to understand why the author failed, and hope to avoid his pitfalls. Instead, the author did not have any first hand experience with any of the techniques discussed. He simply did not apply any mathematical methods, or any method for that matter, during his compulsive purchase of WorldComm shares. So anyone hoping for case studies would be let down.   Secondly, Paulos' arguments are not all that convincing. While he successfully presents an alternative hypothesis based on the incorrect human perceptions of probability, he makes no attempts to disprove established theories. All he has achieved is simply to offer another explanation. The section on technical analysis is particularly poor, as his arguments were rather superficial, and amounted to simply saying technical analysts have not provided convincing prove - he does not feel he needs to go any further. What is confusing to me, is that he rejects technical analysis despite giving a marvellous introduction, and goes on to explain how and why technical patterns form, as well as admitting throughout the book that the psychology of the market is what moves prices - one of several core principles of technical analysis.   Having said all that, "A Mathematician Plays the Market" is an eye-opener in lateral thinking for the non-mathematically inclined, and is a recommended read for financial novices. Professionals in either fields can give this book a miss 
 I'm reading some of the recent reviews and most of them are 5 star reviews. I wonder if they ever sat down and listened to the album or are they aware if Jay-Z is capable of much more.  Anyway Jay-Z's fourth album Vol.3: Life And Times Of Shawn Carter is a semi-decent album at best. In 1999, Jay-Z was possibly enjoying the mainstream status of his career, to the point that he has been lacking on the microphone. He hasn't improved since Vol.2: Hard Knock Life. His rhymes seemed to be slapped together, as shown in the second track "So Ghetto" with rhymes like "Jigga man, Volume 3/I'm back looking like me/stop the presses/ladies drop your dresses." Some tracks just fall flat on the ground like the Mariah Carey assisted "Things That You Do", and and the weak hook on "S. Carter". Awkward moments are on this album like Dr. Dre appearing on the song "Watch Me" as Jigga doesn't shine lyrically on the track. "Come And Get Me" could have been shortened and condenced to three verses, since I've ever heard Jigga do a solo song lasting longer than 4 and a half minutes. Amil, Beanie Sigel, and Memphis Bleek colab with Jay for "Pop 4 Roc" and that fails causing me to loose my attention towards it.  Now there are some good songs on this album though. The first single "Do It Again (Put Ya Hands Up)" was probably a club banger back in late '99/early 2000 with the help of Beanie Sigel. "It's Hot (Some Like It Hot)" Jay turns to his lyrical side and it works somewhat on the better side on this track with rhymes like "I'm about a dollar, what the f*** is 50 Cents" (a response to 50's "How To Rob"). UGK hooks up with Jay on the hit single "Big Pimpin" that is one of the standout tracks (If you remember when it was on the radio/television, Jay had an extra verse, that is not on the album). Mostly the production on this CD saves it from being a failure. "Snoop Track" featuring Juvenile is one of those tracks that carries a good beat.  The bonus tracks "Jigga My N****" appeared on the Ruff Ryders first comp album and "Girls Best Friend" appeared on the Blue Streak Sndtrk. A couple of bonus songs that are better than the ones on the album.  As I said before Jay-Z is capable of doing much better. Many Jigga fans want to hear the same man that was on Reasonable Doubt, and this album is far from what that is. The production saves this from being a complete failure in my opinion. Luckly Jigga stepped his rhymes back up on future albums. If you want to hear more Jay-Z or you have never bought this album and are curious, I recommend this to you. Otherwise pick up other Jigga albums.

 I bought this item no more than two months ago.  And the motor in the fan already broke.  When it arrived the plastic casing was cracked.  Well done Amazon 
 *sigh*... I'm always on the lookout for books about hip-hop (as a music form, culture, and generation) as it relates to American culture.  More specifically, I'm interested in the social ramifications of the culture as a whole.  Thus, when I was given this book by a friend, I was hoping for a good social science read.  Unfortunately, I was highly dismayed, finding this particular selection to be a sloppily written manuscript with virtually no empirical evidence anywhere.  For much of this book, the author makes vague statements which are supposed to be evidence (I.E. - "First and foremost among the reasons white kids love hip-hop is the growing sense of alienation from mainstream American life they experienced in the 1980s") but then makes little or no effort to show proof of such theories.  This is discouraging.  What makes matters worse is that the author later goes on to dismiss the limited evidence that does exist showing whites are the dominant purchasers of hip-hop albums, and instead of inserting evidence which shows otherwise, he launches into page upon page of bizarre hypothesis' for potential ways blacks might still be the majority purchasers (ironically mentioning bootleg CDs).  Ultimately I grew tired of reading his writing which became increasingly less academic.  His "expert" sources are also questionable - while at times he does move towards legitmate figures in the hip-hop community - I felt he vastly stretched for some of the opinions gathered for this book.  For instance, I seriously wonder whether it was wise to include a very long section on a 19 year-old white female for who "hip-hop has been mainstream culture" for her entire life.  Her priciple credits for being mentioned appear to be that she once dated a black guy, doesn't mind the b-word, and got hooked on hip-hop when she heard "Hypnotize" while developing film.  I was not impressed.  If you are looking for an actual intelligent and informed book on hip-hop, please look elsewhere.  Reading this, you'll mainly come away with disjointed personal theories of the author, as well as numerous plugs for THE SOURCE magazine.  1/5 Star 
    Since I do a lot of driving, I bought this as an audio book to hopefully ease the pain of sitting in traffic. This book is more irritating than traffic jams.          The heroine in the book, if you can call her that, was not at all likable. She was arrogant and in my opinion, her arrogance made her foolish. For example, when a police detective she was working with telephoned her on her cell and asked her where she was she responded with a smart remark rather than tell him where she was. Why? Simply because she did not personally like him.  Moments later she was knocked out and taken captive. Later when she woke up she bemoaned the fact that no one knew where she was. Dumb! And this is only one example of her stupidity. Ironically, earlier in the book she referred to this police detective and his partner as tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum. Later, this same policeman saved her life, but she still was unappreciative and belittled him even when it was pointed out to her that the man saved her life.       The "heroine" also had a Canadian boyfriend who pretended he was a cowboy throughout the entire book. I thought maybe the author had just seen "Pillow Talk" with Rock Hudson pretending to be Rex Stetson while she was writing this book. It was bad.       The "heroine" had been separated from her husband for years but failed to obtain a divorce. She seems to have a hard time taking care of unfinished business and she constantly complains about everything.      The author bores the reader with long, drawn out descriptions to the point the reader or listener is screaming, "Okay, I get it! It's hot outside!" If that weren't bad enough, readers or listeners of this book are subjected to lectures on how we evolved from apes and endangered turtles. If I wanted to read about endangered turtles I would go to the non-fiction section. To add insult to injury, the big mystery in the book, the disappearance of an entire family, turned out to be a complete non-mystery.       I was determined to listen to the whole thing but finally, on the last half of the tape, after enduring another political lecture, I could take it no more. I took the tape out and threw the entire thing in the trash.          I have read thousands of books and I've listened to probably more than 60 audio books.  This was the absolute worse of the lot.  If you want to read or listen to a good forensic mystery, stick with Patricia Cornwell and her Dr. Kay Scarpetta series. Cornwell's books are worth reading!  
 I tried this last year, and by the second day I woke up in great pain. I tried it again a few weeks later hoping it wasn't the juice that caused the pain the first time, and the same thing happened.  I give it 2 stars because I actually did lose a few pounds on this stuff 
 This story went nowhere fast. Very unbelievable on so many levels. Jane/Chrira really bothered me and the way she grew into this pig-headed brat made the book hard to finish. I'll give her another try... but I hope Iris doesn't let me down again 
 This photo is very misleading.  The table legs are gold with stripes of black and what is described as slate top is black tile.  The photo showes the tables very light with a light slate but that is not the case with the product we received.  
 Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does. 
 This book was good in that it has some interesting ideas about the future, mortality and aging. This might have made it recommendable.  But the story didn't have any meat on it. It was actually pretty boring and ultimately a disappointment. And for this, it's not really recommendable 
 Castro et al. are to Cuban history what Comrade Stalin and company were to Russian history and Joseph Goebbels and friends were to German history.  The title by itself is laughable.  Who, except for Castro cultists, really thinks that the U.S. military could not have beaten Castro's forces if it had been given the go ahead to do so?  As it was, the defeat of a force of less than 1500 Cuban exiles left stranded by the U.S. on Cuban soil is really a testament to President Kennedy's poor judgement rather than to Communist Cuba's military prowess.  For a truly balanced, historical account of the Bay of Pigs affair, read Peter Wyden's "Bay of Pigs: The Untold Story."  Then, for a study in propagandizing and myth-making, read this book 
 This book was a complete disappointment.  The content is obvious, the expertise less so.    Turbocharge?  No.  If you're asking "what cheesy, small-time, low-class things could I do to promote myself," yes this book has your answers.  If you have hard questions or are looking for serious advice, this is not the book for you 
 This quesadilla maker makes a very colorful addition to the kitchen counter--but that's about it.  It doesn't allow you to put in enough filling to make it worth the trouble! You can barely taste the thin filling layer of chicken, cheese, or whatever--mostly you just taste tortilla. Too bad, because it is a great idea, it just needs to be redesigned 
 Although I understand that this is a procedural text book and that it gives good instruction to those who administer the QRI tests, it is still the most redundant and monotonous text I have ever laid my hands on 
 The Copperhead was my 3rd and last attempt to get a decent performing gaming mouse from the Razer people. I have had 2 Diamondbacks and this Copperhead, all with inherent problems that could not be resolved. The biggest being the expense of the mice.  The Copperhead being the worst of the three with an update format that takes a rocket scientist to get it figured out and never really stood up to half the work it took to get it working second rate. The Diamondback's both would drop out on "boot-up" and leave you mouse less. I did ALL the updates and preps by the manufactures specs and never got them to work right. I have given up on Razer and I suggest that any good gamers not waste their money on Razer's product! I give it 2 stars and that strictly for the lights and color.  
 First of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.    Sadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.    Maybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film.   In addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies)  The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better 
 I found this book disappointing, especially after reading the description and the glowing reviews posted here.  I thought I would get a lot more tips on how to clean quickly and efficiently, but I only found one tip I felt would make a difference.  I also thought the book would give a better plan of attack for cleaning the whole house, but the plan was scattered throughout the book.  I would have liked to have seen that plan presented in a single place (perhaps as a review at the end of the book.)  I also felt this book just scratched the surface of the hows and whys of cleaning and organizing.  I think people would be much better served buying two separate books that go more in depth into both topics.  I don't know which book to suggest for cleaning, but for organizing "Organizing From The Inside Out" by Julie Morganstern is the best.  
 Greer has cleverly culled numerous negative examples from literature and history. Informed by her own prejudices and beliefs, she's come up with nearly four hundred pages of reasons for women to resent and dread the aging process, and the ways in which they will (inevitably, according to this book) be devalued.  The chapters on allopathic, traditional, and alternative treatments are informative, also a chapter on the 'old wives' and 'witches' of history, but overall the forecast is grim. Chapters with flippant titles such as "Sex and the Single Crone," "Misery," and "All Your Own Fault" seemed more polemical than informative. Many of Greer's generalizations and assumptions are just plain silly, for example her statement that aging men want the energy of youthfulness, while women are content with its appearance (p.135). She's against makeup, too -- and has damning words for wearers of it 
 "Classic" implies a degree of excellence.  Instead, this book is merely a compilation of movies from the silents through the 50's without regard to merit---from bomb to 4 star.  I bought this thinking it was devoted to truly good movies from silents to the present with the turkeys weeded out.  It isn't and you would probably be better served to just buy the regular annual guide 
 I just want to let potential marketplace buyers of SALO that the seller: closeoutgoods and other Amazon marketplace sellers are selling pirated (bootlegged) editions of this movie and other Criterion DVDs. If Amazon were legitimate, they would ban these marketplace sellers from their website. Every potential buyer should report these crooks to the FBI and Criterion 
 Actually, I listened to an unabridged audio book, and I thought it was the most painfully slow book I have ever read in my life. It was fairly well-written, but I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen. Finally, it did, and the book was still crawling along. I really wasted my money on this one, and the only reason it got two stars rather than one is that it was well-written - but it surely could have used some pacing and plot 
 I thought that this book was o.k. for the most part, but I really didn't like some parts at all. What really gave the book a bad effect was what LaVaughn finds out about Jody. I think that kind of ruins the book. I was very sure that she was going to talk to Jody, or something, but after she finds out the true thing behind him, I think it was a total waste of writing. I don't really reccommend this book to anyone, it had a nice writing style, but the actual writing wasn't that great 
 The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book.  
 I own several Real Wheels movies and thought I would give this one a shot.  I found the picture quality to be less than I expected and the footage seemed out of date.  The narration was dull and boring, and the children's voices screaming the number of the truck to be annoying.  I would recommend any of the  Real Wheels series instead of this - they never fail to please my 3 1/2 year old truck lover 
 This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo! 
  The fundamental problem with each of the stories in this collection (NICE BIG AMERICAN BABY), is that the author is trying to force what she wants in the world by illustrating archetypes that only in a clichéd sense, the reader would have sympathy for; and reaches the lowest in the final story "Motherland" that is silly, just plain silly.  The writing is weak and doesn't do much except make me think that the author didn't properly revise her work, or simply in the case of the many film screenplay like jumps in which a short paragraph is used to illustrate something about a character, it just seems like she is a very lazy writer.  On the whole, the collection of short stories comes of as a weak form of magic realism, but the problem is that there is not innate spirituality in her writing and even though I don't care much for Marquez, the dean of such writing, he at least imbibed passion into his vivid, colorful world and that is what is needed for that type of story to work; as is, Budnitz's deadpan delivery makes it seem as the author simply has little interest in the world around her, but, moreover, a simple wanton desire to deconstruct the current society for all of its problems, due to the fact the she is merely bored, and if she is bored she should simply stop writing, which is sad as her first novel held such promise, now it appears Bunditz is simply in retrograde.   
 I ended up with three of these litterboxes...from other people who hated them as well.  Here's the thing:  With the grate in, they're very cramped for even the tiniest cat.  Your cat can just deal with it for your convenience?  Not so, my friend.  Because of the cramped quarters, your cat will inevitably end up defecating or urinating on the grate...which makes the entire "sifting" action of it virtually nil.  So, as it stands, I'm yanking the grate, covering up the drawer hole, and using my reliable old scoop. 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 My church has been using this CD, and many people have been raving about it, but I feel that the reviews are unjustified. To me the CD promotes an experiential feeling of worship, where it is the music and the experience of the CD that is creating a 'feeling' of God's presence - many of the previous reviews appear to be alluding to such a thing. Because the songs are conference songs the songs stick to Adoration-type songs only (ie. songs expressing the greatness of God) - and there aren't really any songs which give their *focus* to expressing what God has done for us, or songs of confession, or songs of supplication, or songs by which we can encourage one another. The theology is very one-sided and I think for this reason very unhelpful - compare, say, to having a service where all you prayed for was to praise God for how great he is - while it's a very important thing, it's not the only thing - you are missing out on something and that's what I think this CD does.  The other problem I have is that the arrangements are just too high - sure, the singers on there can sing them, but anyone with an average voice range (especially males) will have some trouble hitting some of the notes in this. "Indescribable" hits a top F - not great for congregational singing.  There are some much better CDs out there with good Christian songs - I'd skip this one and try something else 
 This book is not for anyone who knows anything about numerology.  I wonder how much time Regis Philbin invested reading this book! Silly me - I bought it because of his recommendation on the jacket.  Between the colorless one word definitions of numbers substituted for character analysis, career choices and my future, 14,000 years of history from cro-magnan cave civilization to Plato, Pythagoras and every other number maven in six short paragraphs without transitions, numerous angel sightings and biblical sounding affirmations for miracles,  many pages invested in guidance for recognizing winning lottery numbers , confusing astrology info interjected, confused organization of material and a difficult to read type squeezed onto a penurious publisher's page- there is little meat to digest and after reading the jacket hype, I am very sorry I didn't buy angel blessed lottery tickets with the money I paid 
 Dershowitz is supposed to be a college professor, yet he consistently cuts and pastes sources from Joan Peters fraud, From Time in Memorial.  Norman Finkelstein all proves without any shadow of doubt that this book has manipulated figures from prominent Jewish historian Benny Morris.  Finkelstein debated Dershowitz on Democracy Now about this issue.  Despite Dershowitz's constant interruptions I believe it is the most intertaining debate I have ever seen.  Please download it from Finkelstein's website if you have time.  Dershowitz is just one example of people contributing to the distortion history and creating a fog to the real crisis in Palestine.   
 Berry is one strange cookie.  Self-absorbed is an understatement.  Why is she so mean to her father?  .. 
 Although I gave "Children of the Self Absorbed" high marks, I feel Nina Brown has made a grave error in writing this book. There is no way to a have a mutually satisfying relationship with a partner who has narcissistic personality disorder.  These "people" are void of empathy and are the center of their own universe.   You are nothing more than supply to  them, you are there to serve their egos.  If you take Brown's advise here and stop "feeding " them, they move on to a new victim.  They can not love anyone and will not love you.  I suppose if this is what you're looking for and you don't mind being an object, not a person, go for it.  I just can't imagine why anyone who knows the insidious nature of narcissism, would ever want to teach you how to have a relationship with  one.  Narcissists are abusers and you need to remove yourself from their grasp, not learn how to live within it.  
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 This guide to church growth has gained popularity during the recent trend of mega-church models and numerical prowess in evaluating the current health and future viability of individual churches.  Many of the theories and models are based on business studies and business growth theories.  While the guide may be helpful in identifying strengths and weaknesses in your local congregation, its theories for projecting future growth or your church's demise are analyzed using European and Urban models, and have limited insight into the unique dynamics of the Christian church in the varied regions of North America as a whole.    Most limiting in this perspective is the distinctly spiritual aspect of church growth which results in a gigantic disparity in trying to compare churches and businesses.  This is a manual for analyzing and strategizing, for plotting and planning to stock more "seats in the pews," and makes no significant mention of the actual spiritual journey or genuine troubles and struggles of the very real person searching for belief.  The philosophies of this book graphically illustrates why some other Christian writers such as Eugene Peterson, contend that too many pastors view the members of their churches as assets to be managed rather than human souls with questions, concerns, needs and priorities of their own.  Issues that cannot be forgotten in the numbers game of current church growth modalities 
 I saw a commercial, I read a reviews - and so I bough one box at Walmart. It's not worth it, that's my conclusion. The trays are made of very thin plastic-like material, and are very difficult to position properly on your teeth. The active gel easy goes out of trays, and fills your mouth. During first couple od uses, after 20 min or so I started to feel a vague pain in my gum.  Nevertheless, I continued using the product for all 7 days, as advertised, 30 min a day. After the whole package was gone, the change of color of my teeth is barely visible. I hope you will have better luck.   
 The other books in this series were OK. I found this book too slow paced to stay interested for long. It was very easy to put the book aside in favor of other books. I think the reason Fleur Monley desired the 'white marriage' was a weak excuse considering the extent of her fear. When her reason was revealed I thought,"That's all?" As for Dante, I didn't care for him much. He seemed too juvenile to me. He was very irresponsible. While this book isn't awful, the others in the series are better. The only real reason I can see to read this book is that the reader would want to finish up the entire series, not leaving a book unread 
 This book reads as if it was a term paper for a high school sophomore.  After reading Adams by McCullough and Jefferson by Ellis, this book was so bad that I ended up pulling my bookmark and leaving in on my return flight from Vegas.  Skip this poorly wirtten book and get the Washington biography by Ellis 
 Let me just say that, while I don't own the album, I did buy it for my wife. She loves it. That doesn't say too much for her taste in music, though. She also loves Akon...  I was born and raised in Tallahassee. I listened to an interview that this overly-cocky s.o.b. gave, where he called all the artists in t-town crabs in a bucket, and that he had to struggle and fight to make it out. That he was the first artist to ever make it big out of the Capital City. There are a couple of issues with that. Like mainly the fact that he wasn't first, or even in the top 5.  You may have to go back a little ways, but all you really need to do is check out a Dead Prez song called (of all things) "Tallahassee Dayz". stic.man himself went to Rickards High School on Tally-ho's South Side. So, he (T-pain) needs to get his history straightend up first before he decides to go on national radio and embarrass himself (again, and again, and every time they play his damn songs).  Oh, three more things: 1) That video he claimed he shot in Tally was shot in ATL, 2) I wouldn't have given this any stars if I could've avoided it, and 3) I don't know WHAT he's talking about, but there ain't no strip clubs where I'm from.. 
 These cookies were ok, just ok.  I may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies, every last cookies was broken.  I understand this is probably due to poor packaging.  The consistency was a bit grainy and dry though.  And milk did not help.  Next time I'll purchase a chewy brand or Mrs. Fields 
 Hellas, the author know absolutly nothing about 1917 Fatima Apapritions complexe phenomena. The classic ignorance translated by foriegners writers that follows the old mytical legends. It's a pity that the author ignores the solid research made by Portuguese historians DR. Joaquim Fernandes and Fina d'Armada based in their unprecedent access to the original Fatima archives and official inquiries that are enough different from the old popular religions propaganda. In fact, one needs to read Portuguese to know what REALLY happens in Fatima! So, the author's assumptions about Fatima are indeed a falsehood old Age version.. 
 First off, I'm a huge geek.  I love programming and computers and the internet.  You'd think Wired would be like some great magazine for me.  But the whole thing is just so whiney and worried about all this "bad" stuff in the world, it makes you sick.  For every cool article about Japanese robots, you have to wade through like 10 articles about "how America is doomed".  Whatever...  they need to man up 
 The repeller works fine at repelling, but when on the "rodent" setting it makes an audible chirping noise that's annoying so it can be used only in remote locations where people don't normally go.  The reason we bought this model was because it can run on batteries and we wanted it for an outer shed, but the manual says that it'll only run two or three days on battery power, making it absolutely worthless for this use 
 Not having read Dava Sobel's other books, I can't comment on her skill as a writer, but this book is a disappointment. More concerned with flowery language than getting the facts straight, I read the first half of the book, then began flipping through the rest, finding myself increasingly irritated by the writing style and 'fluffy' thinking. The constant biblical references were extremely tiresome for a book supposedly dealing with facts.  Spend your money on any book by Carl Sagan, and avoid this one 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 Don't buy this edition. Get the first edition, put together by the original editors, G.S. Kirk and J.E. Raven (ISBN 0521091691), which is readily available through Amazon. The current edition has been hopelessly corrupted by M. Schofield, who has edited out crucial fragments in order to support his own "Analytical Philosophy" take on the Presocratics. As an example, he has removed crucial fragments which link Parmenides with the Pythagoreans.   So make sure you acquire the 1st Edition of this crucial sourcebook which was edited in an honest fashion by G.S. Kirk and J.E. Raven, and ignore any later edition which has been corrupted and invalidated by M. Schofield.  Also, take a look at Peter Kingsley's trilogy of books on Parmenides and Empedocles: "Reality," "In the Dark Places of Wisdom," and "Ancient Philosophy, Mystery, and Magic: Empedocles and Pythagorean Tradition." These books will give you the real fragments, and provide you with a real take on why scholars with the intellectual dishonesty of an M. Schofield will rewrite and even abandon the original texts in order to further their own misguided agendas. 
 Glass broke second time shaker used.  Entire glass base broke away from cylinder.  Returned entire item to seller for refund 
 I have just finished up this book in my senior AP lit class.  Reading it was excruciating.  The first bit of the book moves very slowly (well, I admit, the scene where McTeague asks Trina to marry him did crack me up, though I'm not entirely sure that that was what was intended) and the second half is even worse because by then I hated every single character in the book.  Yes, I'm aware they're SUPPOSED to be over the top, but I feel that Norris could have gotten his point across much better if he had been more subtle.  I don't really enjoy being beaten over the head with imagery.  Homer Simpson could have understood this novel fully with ease.     Another thing:  Frank Norris is not that good of a writer.  So much stuff his narrator said was entirely unnecessary.  Laughably unnecessary.  It's honestly just like, god, we get it already!  Shut up!     But then, naturalism isn't really my cup of tea.  I find it melodramtic (a soap opera, if you will) and extremely depressing.  I don't like Social Darwinism, either, which is basically one of the messages Norris is trying sell.  Also, he's a pretty racist S.O.B.     Lastly, why does he spell Owgooste out phonetically sometimes in the narration, and then spell it August other times?  ??  Yeesh.   
 This book offered nothing of real value. I've noticed that the only people that really gave it good comments are other "business and success coaches". There are no real original or earth-moving ideas in this book.  So if you want to hear another "success consultant" write about "shifting paradigms" and "thinking outside the box", the same old tired and worn-out buzz words, buy the boo 
 I acquired this video to interest my students in Dickens as I was about to assign reading.  BIG MISTAKE.  This video, while informative (hence the 2 stars), is dry an an old stick. If you use it, use it in small doses--interject your own anecdotes between small stretches of the video. That'll teach me not to preview a tape before I show it. 
 There are two versions of this book: the regular edition and the "Deluxe" edition. The primary difference is that the Deluxe has additional content on two CDs, one of which contains the self tests. The problem is, the test engine is (by the publisher's own admission) defective. I downloaded the "fixed" test engine from their site, which meant that I could have saved $20 by buying the regular edition and doing the same thing. Even worse, the answers in the "fixed" test engine frequently contradicted the book! With no way of knowing which was correct, I had to get a different study guide and start studying it from square one. Just get a different book like Exam Cram's so you don't spend twice as much time and money 
 This is a very famous book, and so I looked forward to reading it with a lot of hope that it would help my game.  I found it to be pretty close to useless, and would certainly never recommend it to anyone.  It does, however, do a good job of exalting Harvey Penick, which may have been his purpose in publishing it 
 I wish I would've read the last review before ordering this product.  This is a STUDY GUIDE, which usually comes FREE WITH purchase of the $... TEXT BOOK in book stores.  Don't be mislead by thinking you're getting a great deal on a text book.  It's not the real thing 
 Nylander's semi-biographical book on New England women's history is problematic for many reasons.  Firstly, she carries the brunt of her argument on insufficient evidence...only four diaries.   In a region that's rich with historical documentation, she should easily have been able to find more evidence.  Secondly, Nylander systematically ignores issues of class or race, instead depicting a very rosy image of white upper class women as representative of all women in this time period.    At the very least, Nylander should have been more forward about her intended focus 
 This coffee maker has a serious design flaw which causes it to make a mess when brewing 2 cups at once.  The problem occurs because one cup fills up more than the other cup, causing it to overflow coffee all over the appliance and the counter. Trust me..it was a mess.  At first I thought it was because the counter was uneven, so I got out the level and tried it again (with just water) on a table that was absolutely level. I tried running 5 brews, 3 of the 5 overflowed 1 of the cups. The other 2 times, one of the cups was filled to the absolute brim so I couldnt get the top on. The other cup was about 2/3rds filled.    Again...do NOT buy this item. Im sure you can find something similar that works 
 Bubblegum disco , bubblegum cheesy songs.  Avoid it , try Salsoul , Philadelphia Int. etc, if you want to listen to the "real stuff"  
 This is perhaps the most disappointing King book I have ever read (and considering that I have read "Desperation" and "Insomnia" that is saying a lot).  The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story.  I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top.  The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book.  I thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book.  I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of "The Green Mile:  Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I'll read my junk mail.  I cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery 
 If your going to by this book I suggest first paying a friend $12 to have him sit there and lie & complain to you for 4 hours. You'll receive the same entertainment, Steven Hassan is a child, this book should have included finger paints and connect-the-dots chapter 
 What this book demonstrates to its readers is that Pamela Winnick has several strawmen she has erected about science and evolution, and she enjoys beating them regularly. One wonders if she was not subject to abuse with a science textbook at some point in her life, so obvious is her vitriol toward anything scientific.  She has made no effort to check her sources or to even document them; I've Googled several of her unattributed quotes and have found no record of who might have said the things she quotes. For all I can figure out, Ms. Winnick might have made up those quotes herself to support her cause. The editing and proofreading of the book are atrocious enough that I've had to read several sentences more than once to try to ascertain her meaning. As another reader has noted, she never attempts to address to whom she might actually be speaking. Is she upset at science as a method, at scientists in general, or only at those she considers "leftist"? The reader is left to wonder for himself what her motive might be.  It's obvious that she understands very little about evolution, a subject about which she seems very upset. She refers to neo-Darwinism as "the only acceptable scientific explanation for the origin and evolution of life" and neglects to note that evolution says absolutely nothing about the origin of life. She implies that such ongoing social problems as racism are the fault of science. I wondered while I read this book if Ms. Winnick had ever cracked open a science book or if she was capable of using a non-pejorative word to describe a scientist. She makes rather unprofessional and silly remarks about people with whom she disagrees, commenting on their appearances and on their personal lives with the obvious glee of a Kitty Kelley tell-all.  if you'd enjoy reading a book that is an honest discussion of either politics or science, _A Jealous God_ is not for you. If, however, you enjoy being preached to in unprofessional and underhanded ways about the distaste all religious people should have for scientists, then by all means, pick up this book. If you enjoy poorly edited and non-annotated books written by laymen about the problems with science, then this book's for you. It's certainly not an honest portrayal of anything within the real world or outside of Ms. Winnick's worldview in which scientists are a terrible evil 
 If I wanted over 200 hundred pieces of inane advice on pregnancy, I'd ask my mother-in-law. 
 As I read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by Mr. Cussler, the story was slow and the plot was transparent.     This book just didn't have the "zing" of the older Cussler stories.  If you are just laying around with nothing else to do it will give you something to read 
 Myth #1: American women live under patriarchy   Myth # 2: America's the World's leading threat to the environment   Myth # 3: America is a racist nation   Myth # 4: The Untied States is an imperial power.   Myth # 5: The rich get richer, the poor get poorer   ALL FACTS.  Plus, The higher the IQ the more liberal someone is. Ben Franklin, Einstein, our founding forefathers like Thomas Jefferson...all liberals. The lower the IQ the more conservative because it is easier to not think for yourself. I love America, but changes need to be made.  Rome fell too eventually from bad politics 
 I received the printer (as a great gift) on January 16th, I set it up and it wouldn't print - the ink cartridge holder seemed stuck in place.  I called Epson who shipped me out a replacement with no charge or delay.  I used that printer for two weeks and it quit.  Same problem with the ink cartridge holder.  Once again Epson customer service shipped me a new replacement printer.  It worked for another two weeks and quit on me yesterday (same problem).  So, I'll call Epson when they open tomorrow and try to upgrade to a new/different printer or try once again. The printing results are spectacular, especially when using Epson 4* glossy paper.  Anyone else with problems? 
 Petra of all places. Supernatural protection, persecution, on ad naseum. The one drug on, and on, and on,  and on ......  Same tired story, persecution by Carpathia a lame attempt at evil incarnate and his lackies. Sorry..   I think the series denegrates Christianity rather then exalting it.   I've read all 12 and found it morose and condemning. The opposite of how I view Christianity is. 
 This GPS comes with US map on the SD card and Canada map on the included CD but never the twain shall meet.  By car I'm a few hours from Canada and several days from the eastern US but I can't swap out the faraway eastern US part of the map on the TomTom Go 300 for a nearby Canadian map.  It's either all Canada or all contiguous US.  This is a major functional flaw if you live near the US/Canada border or live further away and like to take cross-border trips.  Oh, and if you do decide to swap out the US map, be sure to save it on your computer first - TomTom doesn't bother to provide a backup on the CD so if you don't first make your own backup before changing to the Canadian map you can't later get the US map back 
 I was really hopeful about this product working.  I have four dogs, ages 2 through 8.  I tried and tried to teach them how to use this product, but they just never could make the connection of the bark to pushing the button.  They just ignored the paw and wouldn't ever put their paw on it to even touch it 
 I was looking forward to gaining some real insights with this book.  However, it is one of the most disapointing books on the subject I have read.  The infomation is dated, the size of the book is pitifull. Trying to remain objective, there are a few handy formulas for detailed calculations, the rest of the information here is old news, and all available for free on the net. Ed has, in the past written some of the best and most well known material on this subject.  But this book is just not worth buying.  Ed Rosenthal where has your integrity gone 
 Just not that impressed with this book.  The write-up was much better than the book itself.  Superficial.  Will be selling my copy as used 
 This book misrepresents eating disorders and makes eating disorder sufferers almost seem psychotic. The author is very inexperienced with eating disorders and only has her word to back up her statements. She puts down eating disorder facts that have proven to be true for many of us that have suffered with eating disorders. The one good thing about the book is how she encourages treating victims of eating disorders with love and compassion and her methods  may work with some individuals, yet I have talked to those that have said that working with her was a terrible experience. I think her kindness is what drew her clients. She states that her way is the only way to help anorexics which ignores the fact that people are individuals. And she ignores the fact that other therapists besides her have had a high success rate and she puts down therapies that have helped me and many others. Some of her theories almost seem  mystical. Almost like those with eating disorders are saints or psychics of some sort.  It is good to note that her clinic was closed down for operating without a license.   
 Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less 
 this book is a staple among the clever clogs chattering classes, even though he mis-spells the word "shown" at least a hundred times. The prose is terrible and I had no idea what he was talking about.  Verdict: Ivory tower rubbish 
 Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series.  
 The history of the making of the Nancy Drew books is fascinating, and I did enjoy reading that part of this book. However, the author simply could not keep her point of view (that the Nancy Drew authors and creators were modern feminists, showing the great big male world what women could do back then) when the facts simply did not support this point of view. The author even says that the writers SAY they didn't think they were being pioneering or feminists, yet, the author tells, us, even though they say there weren't, they are, and Rehak insists on it. I can't understand how an editor could have allowed so much bias to enter into this book unless the editor, too, shared this slanted point of view.  So, read this book for the history, that part is fascinating. But take all the feminism with a grain of salt. Mildred Wirt Benson is a fasincinating lady, but her intention with Nancy Drew was simply to write a great story and earn a living. She was not trying to impress any men or show the male world that women rule, as the author seems to imply 
 While Guy Grand's pranks are amusing, the book lacks any real satirical center or dramatic structure, which would give it some meaning (and some real bite).  You could take the chapters out of their present sequence, reassemble them in any order, and the book would be just as effective --- and that's about as damning a criticism as I can think of.  The book utlimately is a washout.  It starts and stops in the same place, and in between the narrative just meanders from episode to episode without any real idea of what it wants to do, or how to do it.  Not Southern's best, by any means, but better than tripe like CANDY 
 listen to these directions ..click selection tool..click edit ..paste in front..then move bracket to center and copy text.. !?  that's what you're getting here..STAY AWAY..I can't believe teachers use this garbag 
 Lies, lies, lies. I know of a case where a woman who is a total and utter verbal abuser, wealthy, has convinced her support group that SHE is the victim. She is a total victimizer. Her children are straight A students, no drugs, clean rooms, no trouble with authorities. But the trouble is her abusiveness...anyhow...the groups claim to not support physical and verbal abusiveness on the part of parents, but none of that has changed with this woman....Never does this book talk about child abuse. Never does it address that end of the coin. It never deals with educational neglect, other sorts of neglect on the part of parents. John Holt, a ten times better writer, parent, educator, PERSON that the folks that got this book ghost written (couldnt even write it themselves), said "THERE ARE NO PROBLEM CHILDREN WITHOUT PROBLEM PARENTS.&quot 
 In many ways this book is just as interesting as previous books in the series. Adams humor is in tact and will have you snickering fairly often.  The main problem is that of the overall plot. It is unsatisfying and pessamistic. Not just the ending. Tricia Mcmillian or Trillan turns from being a likable and symathetic character to somone who uses people and makes them clean up her mess. It is a heartbeakingly unfit end to a series I have such fondness for. This is compounded by the fact that the late Douglas Adams wished to write a sixth book after this one but never got around to it.   At this point it is better to consider the fourth book the final guide since it has such a satisfyingly beautiful end. For those who love the works of Adams should read it anyway, since it is well... a douglas adams book. Just dont be to dissapointed when you are dissapointed 
 I fall asleep at every single chapter. I think that it's meant for older people AND as a torturing device for high school students! (AHS -I hate summer assignments!) I mean, come on! We're only rising 11th graders! This kind of stuff doesn't interest most of us yet 
 Slow and delayed shipping. bought this book on June 28,  almost two weeks ago and they just shipped it  now July 8, 2006 after 10 days of paying. They said the estimate arrival book is on July 15-26.    The summer is almost over and my kid wont be needing this anymore 
 Has Danieele Steel been abducted by aliens or has she been "Kloned" and this insane Klone wrote this book.  I actually thought about not finishing this book but I thought there might be a logical ending...Beyond disappointing.  Her characters have no substance, I don't want to meet the person who could relate to these whimpy weirdos.  This might be the worst book I've ever read. I just read this book, quite quickly in one afternoon. I think I've pretty much purchased and read every Danielle Steel book she's ever written as they used to be entertaining quick reads. I understand she has become an empire but must she also be a book writing factory. There is never much suprise as to how a DS book will end, the pleasure in reading them comes from the twist and turns, historical and geographical research she puts into her books. This book reads more like a short story as many of her other recent books. Definately not worth the hardcover price, the paperback price or even the used price. Time to slow down and put out some quality work instead of quantity 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 This is easily the WORST casebook I have ever owned. LOUSY for learning future interest and possessory estates. LOUSY for learning mortgages. LOUSY for learning adverse possession. Mainly lousy, lousy, lousy. Don't buy this book without purchasing a hell of a study aid b/c you won't learn jack from it since it's horribly written. Don't buy this book w/out purchasing a hell of a good pair of reading glasses b/c the print is practically microscopic. I can't believe I have to suffer through another property course w/this terrible book 
 Buy "How to draw comics the Marvel Way" instead, as Stan Lee and John Buscema cover all the necessary points in a few pages, as opposed to wasting your money on a book like this. Although kudos to this guy for padding a book this size. He must be close with Scott McCloud 
 There is a typo in the very first sentence of the book. This is just a small foreshadowing of the rest of it. Did anyone proof read 
 Sting (of whom I think very well as a musician in his own terms) has given a step into the early baroque-lute-song reperoire of great composer John Dowland... Too bad for him. There are plenty of better choices (almost everyone that exists) for this music... I belive most of the people who will buy and listen this CD do not have any idea of how this music must be sung., and most of them must be fans of the singer... Well, good for them because they will have the opportunity to hear a great composer and some of the most touching music per voice and lute... but ror the rest of us... this cd is just a fiasco 
 Maybe I was expecting too much out of this text, but I simply did find anything here that was either apologetic or even semi-compelling. This book is an assessment, as in an exposition, of certain facets/tenets of freewill theism (open theism). However, Basinger left too much to my imagination. In other words, Basinger covered only a few things that an open theist would have to account for in their overall theology (i.e. the problem of evil, divine omniscience, and petitionary prayer). What was left out was a thorough assessment of the attributes God according to the freewill theists. For instance, is God in time or eternal (immutable or mutable)? If God is temporal how does that affect freewill theism's view of divine omniscience? The notion of God being temporal certainly has significant ramifications on His knowing future contingents. While I already know the answers to these question via reading other freewill theists, had this been the first freewill theist book I had read, these things would not have been answered for me. Why? This is a crucial question, especially since this book totes to be a philosophical assessment of the issues.  Furthermore, to what extent does freewill theism limit God? While Basinger briefly covered omniscience, this section left me wanting (it was too empty in content). However, I did think Basinger's criticisms of MK (middle knowledge) were interesting (pp. 43-48). I must point out though that MK was misrepresented on page 89. Basinger claims that "If God possess MK, Hasker informs us, then he intentionally brings about each event that actually occurs." This is not MK as it was espoused by it's originator, namely Luis de Molina (see Freddoso's translation titled "On Divine Foreknowledge.") This book was not so much a case for freewill theism as it was an exposition of certain theological tenets. I wish Basinger would have been a little more direct and detailed for his reader and given a clearer assessment of the whole freewill thought. It almost seemed as if he was afraid to just come out and declared the limitations and changes that freewill theists have place on the God of the Bible 
 I use to subscribe to SHAPE several years ago, and then it was packed full of great work out routines, meal plans, etc for women at all levels of fitness.     Well . . . my last few months of Shape have been a complete disappointment.  I found very few pages of good genuine fitness and healthy eating advice.  Instead, it ranks right up with Glamour in the category of magazines with the highest percentage of advertisements, nearly all of the excercise material is supposed "quick fix" fitness fluff which gives women very unrealistic expectations, and the healthy eating advise is absolutely elementary.    There is no substance in here for women like me, the average working woman who desire to live a healthy life everyday and have limited time to commit to exercise.  I want a magazine that is inspiring with a focus on living a sustained healthy lifestyle, not a joke about getting flat abs in a week with illustrations of perfectly chiseled models who obviously do not face the body challenges of average women.  I'm sorry but most women are not going to look like "her" after two weeks, or many months of Shape's 10-30 minute a day routines, but they sure lead you to beleive so.   I highly recommend "Her Sports"  it is THE magazine for women desiring to live an active, day-to-day healthy life 
 Is it just me, or do people not reliaze that this CD [...]. I mean come on! Actually, I was going to bootleg this CD, but at about the 12th song...I just said "Nah!" Now, your 12th edition of your series suffers from filler! Seriously, if I was to ask someone if they've heard of "Luv U Better", "Breathe", "I Should Be", or "Made You Look", they would be like WHAT?! You listen to techno still!!! No, I don't listen to techno. I listen to pop, hip-hop, r&b, and a bit of rock. Later on in life, you'll look on the back of this CD, and you will only know 2 or 3 of the songs on here. Really, Now 12 is an opposite of a TH complication. On Now 12, the crappy songs are at the beginning and the ending has all of the good tracks (there are only about 2 or 3). And still, some of the good songs are filler! The only songs on this entire complication I will remember are "Miss You", "Stole", "When I'm Gone", and maybe "Angel". The rest is either [...]  GO GET NOW 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and later 18+. NOW 12 [... 
 Unfortunately, this freshman effort from writer/director Maria Maggenti and her two lead actresses reeks of amateurism.   Littered with painful dialogue and clunky performances, "Two Girls in Love" is implausible and inauthentic to the point of embarrassment.   For a more believable (as well as more intelligent and erotic) young lesbian love story, check out the understated and off-beat BBC production, "My Summer of Love" (2004). A similarly themed film that's downright hilarious - and with a killer score to boot -- "But I'm A Cheerleader" (1999) is a gem. From the same year, "Better Than Chocolate" has it all - humor, originality, plot, dialogue, performances, and sensuality.   The only incredible thing about "Two Girls in Love" is that it got released in the first place, as without its lesbian twist it's little more than a third-rate Romeo and Juliet tale 
 The fan is so weak, it makes the product useless. It may be able to cool a small flea. Perhaps an ant. Maybe a centimenter of human skin. Don't waste your money 
 Sean Hannity's rise to fame proves that an ignorant illiterate can rise well beyond the level of incompetence in this country, especially when their audience consists of like-minded organ banks.  Hannity is stupid, hypocritical and loud.  His sole redeeming quality is as a mechanism for carbon-oxygen exchange.  Hannity is well-coiffed, well dressed  and well short of thorazine on his overhyped comedy duo called the Hannity and Combs report.  This bozo is so uptight he must wear a chastity belt 2 sizes too small.  Get a real job, you poser 
 This book has a fairly annoying layout which refers back to information not previously mentioned.  The examples are also fairly overly complex, there are much simpler ways to solving the problems.  Regardless, it was a required book 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I did not purchase this book.  I had the luxury of checking it out at my local library for FREE.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME buying this book.  I've read the majority of the book & I'm sick & tired of these author type people capitalizing on other people's desires and emotions.  FACT:  Everyone wants to be rich and have a more comfortable lifestyle.  Do not lead people to buy your book if you cannot present them with useable knowledge!  I will save you the hours of time it takes to read this waste of time & tell you what the authors are trying to tell you.  This is their hidden message........"Find a really good idea & go for it!"  Wow!  Great idea!  News to me?  I think not.  That's it.  The whole book boiled down to that.  There are plenty of good books out there for any interested in becoming wealthier and/or living a more comfortable lifestyle.  This isn't one 
 I admit I didn't finish reading this book, as I was so confused after a few chapters that I gave up. 1. It is unclear what exactly Ladoux means by emotion. Sometimes it seems that he is only talking about emotions that result in an action. (Reasonable as that's what you can test) But there are passages when he talks about "liking" somebody as an emotion. I love my husband and I don't like Tom Cruise but I would hardly equate those feelings as equal emotions. If I read a recipe and think I'd like to taste it, is that the same as the rage I feel against people who have hurt me? They certainly have different origins in my brain (I think) 2. I got totally lost in his review of the psychological studies of emotion. Yes, the development of theories is an important part of the study but when I still can't tell what you are theorizing about, the various diagrams and referrals to studies didn't help. I also lost the logical steps in the argument, perhaps because the summary was brief; I didn't see how B logically followed A in some of his review of the theories. Perhaps the rest of the book redeems it, but if this book is written for the layperson, more care is needed in explaining the boundaries and definitions 
 If your a Duke fan like me, you will love the movies on their own merit. I am just not happy that the DVD's didn't have extra features like behind the scenes footage. Oh well, I guess I will have to live with that.. 
 Repetitive magical drivel for people who want to stick in a rut. Better to get a life instead 
 A friend lent me Good In Bed when I'd run out of ideas for books to read. I read it, didn't care much for the characters, and ultimately came out of the story feeling worse about life.   A few months later, I came upon this book, and since Weiner's actual writing style wasn't so bad, I thought I'd check it out. I didn't even finish it.   It seems as if Jennifer Weiner writes to make herself feel better when she's down; exalting overweight, plain-faced girls who have a tendency to whine, writing the petite and attractive with overtones of condescencion and contempt, and failing completely to create a male character with more than one and a half dimensions.   That said, this could have been a good story. Weiner does have some talent as a writer... her prose flows easily and is unpretentious, she speaks realistically even when the characters are hardly likeable, and the general ideas of the plot following the sisters' relationship, the connection with their grandmother, and what they do after their falling-out were all fun and interesting. I did very nearly almost care about these characters.   Still, I couldn't actually bring myself to give a hoot about these whiny, one-dimensional people. It's books like this that make me hate chick-lit so much. If you want to read girly stories, I'd rather you go to Barbara Kingsolver or Amy Tan... at least they have brains to back up their talent 
 I rented this movie for 2 reasons. First, because it looked like it might be a good horror movie and Second, because Casper Van Dien stars in it! This movie fails to live up to horror movie status and Van Dien's performance wasn't all that great even though I wish he would have had a bigger role in this movie. Overall disappointing movie and boring plot 
 This book reads like a graduate thesis. It manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments. Each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length, but I recommend not finding out for yourself; spend your money elsewhere 
 I have not read this edition of Dr. Kent's book, but as a former student of Dr. Kent's, I was forced to buy his text when I took his comparative anatomy course.  At the time, I found it a difficult read of marginal  usefulness.  When he left Louisiana State, a different, far better text was  introduced.  If this is merely an update of that volume, I echo others who  recommend other sources 
 Such a sad sequel to the best video game movie. Mortal Kombat: Anilhilation was anihilated the day it was made. The story was poorly done. I didn't like how the characters act in this film. Jax {Williams} acts like a afician-american stereotype. Sonya {Hess} acts like a weak little bitch. Sindel {Vander} acts like one of those pathetic villianess you see in those direct-to-video films that have dumb villianess. And Brian Thompson should be a shame of himself, such a good character actor playing a pethetic Shao Khan.  One thing that sucks in this film is that Radien {Remar} and Shao Kahn are brothers and Shinnok {Schore} is their father. What a pathetic change to add in this film. Raiden and Kahn are far from family and Shinnok and Kahn don't even like each other...and they're not father and son in the game.  This film cost $30 million, yet the special effects in this film look so cartoony. In fact, I've seen Playstation One graphics look better than that.   This film is really bland, and John R. Leonetti directing style sucks.  If you wanna watch a sequel to Mortal Kombat, just watch yourself playing Mortal Kombat 2 on Midway's Arcade Greatest Hits 2 on Playstation 2 and XBOX 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 What a slog it is trying to get through this book. I'm nearly there (I've read 3 or 4 other books since starting this)... the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends, and the mostly rave reviews it's got here. Ignatius Reilly, the main character is interesting enough (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring, I find myself flicking on the pages to see how far I have to go before the story gets back to Ignatius again. I keep thinking "OK, the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon"...there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the Pulitzer Prize. I'm at a loss to explain its popularity 
 Sorry this was my lease favorite of Bobby Bear maybe because they where not his songs! 
 this hippy master of CHEESE made my middle years a living HELL with his horrid M.O.R. sap toons! How can ANYONE actually praise these corntastic AM gold leftovers from an era that had some REAL music  going on? This is like putting AIR SUPPLY over the BEATLES as a GREAT ROCK BAND---wake up America! 
 This book reminds me of the ramblings of a conspiracy theorist.  Mr Thomas has a terrible tendancy of starting stories showing operatives in the present (which is totally uninteresting) then flashing back to the past.  Often the flashbacks never revert to the present, or have another flashback within a flashback.    I am no expert on Israeli intelligence activities, but when an author falsly reports a simple fact "Israel has developed its own over-the-horizon accuracy for three German-build nuclear-powered submarines it had bought" (Germany doesn't have nuclear powered submarines, and Israel certainly doesn't have them) I begin to question his more controvertial theories and "facts. 
 Edelman uses overly complicated language to describe consciousness. He repeatedly uses abbreviations C and C'. To stand for the underlying neural process of consciousness. Furthermore, he would have us assume that consciousness itself, actually did nothing, but it is the neural substrate ( of consciousness) that does the work for consciousness. That is basically saying anger does not cause, or help in causing, me to hit someone. It was all the neuron's fault. In my opinion, Damsio's series of books does a lot better in every aspect of explaining consciousness including: 1. explaining the purpose of consciousness 2. why it evolved 3. future implications in the scientific study of consciousness 
 There were many times when I had to mentally and physically shake my head as Nye supports his thesis that America's dominance in this globalized system actually necessitates its interdependence with the rest of the world (read; France and Germany).     The underlying idealism of Nye points to a world where if only the United States of America would submit, just a little, to other states and respect (read; follow) their opinions then BY GOLLY our Air will be cleaner and North Korea and Iran will give up their nuke programs.  Also, Europe will magically create a more robust military transport capability and actively participate in counterterrorism and ethno-religious conflicts abroad which, will be on the decline.    My biggest gripe was Nye believing that self constraint will somehow lead to greater leadership opportunities above when these tools of self constraint are tools used by weaker countries to limit US power.  That's why, 'they' want to make US weaker.  Nye, in one sentence by my count, concedes this point but still argues that in the long term it'll be for the good.  However, Nye does not recognize the ulterior motives by countries such as Germany and a nostalgic France (Europe is given way too much credit and attention in his book as well).  Given the self interests of other states and the entrenched problems associated with failing states, failed states, and the Middle East it is a stretch to believe that countries will unite with the United States (who will still be the 100 ton gorilla in the room) and make the world a better place.    I don't buy it.  So...don't buy it.  
 This is a very famous and a very influential book. This was not the first time I checked the book out of the library but I now know much more about antidepressants and the related issues than I did when I first became familiar with Kramer's book. What I found on my quick survey of the book this time amazed me. This is not a book supported by research. It is a book of stories. The stories, one after the other, are about Kramer's patients (Kramer is a psychiatrist) and how taking Prozac dramatically transformed lives overnight. Consider these four examples. 1. Sam: "Sam not only recovered from his depression, he declared himself better than well. He felt unencumbered, more vitally alive, less pessimistic. Now he could complete projects in one draft, whereas before he sketched and sketched again. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. His memory was more reliable, his concentration keener. Every aspect of his work went more smoothly. He appeared more poised, more thoughtful, less distracted. He was able to speak at professional gatherings without notes.(Page x.) 2. Sally: After four months on Prozac, she looked brighter, calmer, self-assured, in control of herself. The most important effect of the medication, Sally felt was that it cleared her head...After ten months...she negotiated a small promotion and pay raise at a time when the bank was cutting back staff...More remarkable was the change to her private life. She started going to dances...(Page 147.) 3. William M: The patient's low self-esteem, which had been present since his earliest childhood, began to disappear...On medication William M. experienced a sense of self-worth superior to any he had felt before. (Page 203.) 4. Ms. B: For the first time in her memory she felt perfectly relaxed and happy sitting at home reading books or listening to music and felt less of the free-floating anxiety that was previously quelled by going out...Off Prozac, Ms. B. bar-hopped in search of men. Prozac moderated her sense of aloneness and allowed her to enjoy a variety of social settings. Dozens of other examples could be cited. The point is, this is essentially the book. It is a book which convinces the reader of the almost magic power of Prozac by sharing stories like these. What is disturbing is that I now know the truth. Research investigations have found that the power of antidepressants has increased dramatically. They are now more effective because our belief in the power of a pill to cure social shyness, anxiety, depression, and a bad temper has increased dramatically. We have come to believe, as Kramer puts it, "biology is destiny" (page xiv). No where does Kramer explain that the longest of the clinical trial used to get approval of Prozac to market was only 8 weeks long. No where does he share that a tranquilizer was given to study subjects and the other tricks used to make the effectiveness of the drug appear greater than it really is. The dangers of long-term use (diabetes, Parkinson's disease, permanent muscle jerking, etc.) are never discussed. (Of course, these problems were still unknown when Kramer wrote.) See Timothy Scott's wonderful, and unlike Kramer's book, carefully documented book America Fooled: The Truth About Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, and How We've Been Fooled to find the dangers as well as what does bring good mental health. Yes, this book has been influential. Thus, Kramer bears some of the responsibilty for the myth surrounding antidepressants. (They do not work as well as exercise even--numerous studies.) It's funny how, as our knowledge grows, a great book beomes a harmful book, but it is just that.    
 Somewhat dull and unsatisfying, like some other "literary" works I've read which don't hole my interest, don't resolve problems, swimming endlessly in the inner thoughts of a person with no action or only references to previous actions. I enjoyed his 'They Came Like Swallows' because it was very satisfying, but this is too "literary" for me in the sense that it appears to be more about the writer's writing ability than the actual story. 
 I was waiting for something to happen in this book but nothing did. There is no plot, the characters described very poorly and the writing is definitely unimpressive (I would not mind the writing so much if the plot was there). Throughout the whole book all the main character does is answers the phone and gets coffee ... how exciting is that?   
 This book is an excellent affirmation of Christian values that must be read by anyone who didn't realize that "The Da Vinci Code" was a work of fiction. Please reread that sentence; "The Da Vinci Code" is a work of fiction, like "Star Trek" or "Harry Potter". Unfortunately, the same people who fail to appreciate this fact are the same people who actually need to read "Cracking Da Vinci's Code," in order to restore balance to a worldview so easily upset by Dan Brown's clever yarn.   Unfortunately, this book is poor ammunition for anyone actually hopeing to defend the Christian faith from a popular fascination with the romanticized Cult of the Magdelene presented by Dan Brown. Doctors Garlow and Jones, both highly educated evangelists, have crafted a book that is more or less comfort food for their audience, not any scholarly attempt to address the factual underpinnings of Brown's novel. Somewhat pointedly, Garlow and Jones choose some of the weaker elements of Brown's novel to base their case on.  For instance, by way of dealing with non-Canon gospels (the Gnostic gospels, and the somewhat-less-offensive Apocryphal texts), Garlow and Jones give a selective history of the Council of Nicea which posits that they merely reaffirmed a version of the New Testament already in circulation. This is somewhat true, but ignores how the wording of the gospels were decided to specifically reaffirm the Nicean view of Christianity at the expense of other popular Churches of the time (including churches established by the very disciples of Jesus). They cast aspersions on non-Canon texts without actually addressing why they are or aren't considered reliable. Likewise, when it comes to a discussion of Paganism and its influence on Christian theology, the authors steadfastly refuse to acknowledge even the possiblity (much less the accepted fact) that rituals central to Christianity - such as baptism, the eucharist, and  chrism (annointing with oil or ashe) - were all employed by pagan cults for thousands of years prior to Christianity. Instead, Garlow and Jones rely on the emotional impact of the epithet "pagan" on their reader to cast aspersions and reinforcce doubt.   Most disappointing about this book is that the authors attack fiction with fiction. Where there exist stronger points in the scholarship that underpin Brown's fiction (and I can't emphasize enough that "The Da Vinci Code" is JUST an entertaining story), Garlow and Jones turn instead to a fictional couples experience attending a discussion group of Brown's book and it's central thesis, which naturally involve secularist ridicule of faithful Christians engaged in acts of ministry.   There are even a few instances where the authors manufacture assertions by inferral that were never made by Brown or any of his characters. Half way through this book, I got the distinct impression that neither Garlow or Jones (nor their editor) ever actually read Browns fictional works.  This is one of those rare books where I was relieved to finally have finished it. There is no vice in the spirited defense of ones faith through the presentation of facts in support of rational argument. Unfortunately, this book is very light on facts, and frequently resorts to emotional arguments. The Gospels tell us that Jesus himself debated with authority found in a thorough knowledge of the law, and was skilled in avoiding rhetorical traps. Garlow and Jones do the opposite: they count on the unfamiliarity and uncertainty of the general population, and frequently employ rhetorical traps. Anyone seeking to be Christ-like, and defend their faith, would do well to not rely on this book. 
 Should a book be rejected simply on basis of its foreword?  Absolutely.  John Piper's "For Single Men and Women (And the Rest of Us)" reinforces just about every myth associated with the term "The Gift of Singleness" FINALLY being exploded by new Christian writers dealing with the current epidemic of protracted singleness in the church.  These myths have gone unquestioned for so long because anyone who challenges them runs the risk of being admonished for discontentment, doubting or even disobeying God's sovereign will.  Individuals silently suffer, and the church continues to suffer as these misconceptions endure.   Despite his best intentions, Piper has contributed to the problem with obsolete works on singleness that endure on many websites (all but one of the references to this foreword are from the 70's and 80's), not to mention his heavyhanded "Don't Waste Your Life/Cancer" message that has inspired spinoffs ("Don't Waste Your Singleness") and edgy imitators, mostly married men who have the luxury of being oblivious to the current predicament of single women in the church facing a severe shortage of potential husbands.  See Barna Archives, CampuslifeCollegeGuide.com male/female ratios, and Christianity Today articles by columnist Camerin Courtney, who calls the Christian man shortage "the issue that rises to the top" for Christian singles today).  The only gender imbalance Piper bothers to mention is among those in Christian service, from whom he seems to be getting his information on singleness.  Failing to discuss the surplus of female singles in the larger church body seems like either a deliberate side-step of the issue or ignorance of the facts.  Either way, it's inexcusable for a document of this stature that makes such sweeping declarations about how people should live their lives.  Sensitivity aside, there are numerous problems with "the gift of singleness", starting with the fact that it's not in the Bible.  Ever since the 70's, when the Living Bible and other modern translations began the erroneous use of this phrase in 1 Corinthians 7:7, Christian leaders have assumed that IDIOS CHARISMA meant "own grace gift" from God of either marriage or singleness.  But "idios" is more correctly translated as "idiosyncratic", which suggests that Paul was referring to something much more unique than the either/or status of married or single. He accentuates his point about uniqueness using a Greek expression still common today: "hos men houto de hos houto", most closely translated in the NASB as "one in this manner, and another in that."  It's a figure of speech!  "This" and "that" are non-specific: "this" does not mean marriage and "that" does not mean "singleness".  As much as he recognized the advantages of singleness at that time of "present distress" v.26, we have no reason to believe that he saw it as a gift or calling.     Nor can we assume that Paul was making claim to some special gift of celibacy: whatever was his gift that allowed him to proceed on such a perilous mission alone, he probably didn't quite understand himself.  Certainly, there's no biblical evidence to suggest that God ameliorated his sexual desires, (but plenty that suggests he struggled with something of a fleshly nature), nor is there anything in the Bible claiming that "with the gift comes the grace to be chaste", as Piper dangerously suggests.  Is he aware that less than one third of single Christians remain virgins until marriage?     Coinciding with these late 20th century biblical revisions, rogue doctrines on singleness have proliferated throughout the Christian world.  The never-married, later disgraced Bill Gothard taught millions who attended his Basic Youth Conflicts seminars that singleness as a gift and a calling, using the terms interchangeably, with the underlying assumption of divine assignment or "rhema".  Into the 80's and 90's there may have been some softening attempts that stressed "gift" over "calling", but the two remain inextricably linked.  Obviously, this is damage control because there has been damage done.  Ellen Varughese in "The Freedom to Marry" wrote at length about Christian singles immobilized in their intent to pursue marriage without any clear "word from the Lord", having been taught to view their default singleness as "God's plan" for their lives, rather than as something that could be caused by individual or generational sin.  This is just another symptom of modern Christians becoming too quick to frame events in terms of God's personal plan for an individual's life, leading to excuse making, doubtfulness, magical thinking, and lack of compassion. In order to restore the ordinariness and universality of marriage enjoyed by previous generations of Christians, we must put the emphasis back on God's revealed will about marriage, which puts the onus on human volition (i.e. a man "finds a wife" in Proverbs 18:22, or "takes a wife" in 1 Corinthians 9:5, "some made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven" in Matthew 19; Note: God's instruction for Jeremiah to not marry was particular to time and place).    From its biblically specious roots to the careerism of Christian singles writers who keep passing it on, "the gift of singleness" does not have an honorable history.  It has become a thorn in the side of the a generation of surplus Christian women that dismisses their collective grief and allows leaders to hide behind sermons about sovereignty and contentment instead of addressing the sinful causes of this epidemic, such as the flight of men from our churches (as well as teachings that have sown seeds of doubt, ambivalence, and complacency towards pursuing marriage).  But a few of us have caught on to this insidious cycle, most notably Debbie Maken, who has written a book about "rethinking the gift of singleness".   We do not need to call singleness a gift to effectively encourage spiritual essentials such as gratitude and contentment, or to honor those who have devoted themselves to celibate service (and wouldn't need the flattery of calling it a gift, if indeed their service is sincere).  Even if you share Piper's extreme views on sovereignty (he wrote an article after September 11th titled "Why I Do Not Say, 'God Did Not Cause the Calamity, but He Can Use It for Good'"), there are plenty of things that God has given that are not considered gifts.  When was the last time you heard the Ten Commandments referred to as a gift?    Let's all send "the gift of singleness" to the Christian lexicon trashbin, and work together to persuade church leaders to do the same.  We can begin by appealing to the editors of The Message and other modern translations to restore translations of 1Corinthians 7:7 so that they once again conform more closely with the original Greek.  Most importantly, Christian singles need more than to be told "if you marry, you do not sin".  If we care about the future of the church, we should give them a wholehearted blessing to pursue marriage, with no reservations whatsoever about God's will.           
 I bought this flash hoping to improve my indoor pictures with my Rebel XT.  Amazingly, I find absolutely no difference between using the built in flash of the camera or this unit.  I find pictures taken at a very reasonable distance (8-10 feet) to be under-exposed unless I correct the exposure using the menu.  Would be curious if the more expensive units including the 430EX are better, but I cannot recommend this one 
 One word: garbage. This stuff reminds me of a spoof Will Ferrell did on Saturday Night Live a while back about some lame singer (Robert Goulet). Same voice here for this so-called singer except it apparently was not intended as a joke. I'd rather listen to the screeching sound of nails on a chalk board than this, thank you.. 
 I thought it would be really cool to be part of a society that wore red hats in public.  Being part of a club where one could identify another club member because they are wearing a certain item of clothes while in public, fascinates me.  But then I started reading the book.  I found the characters non-believable.  The rules of the club, do overs and make overs were just too restrictive.  Life is not about squashing dialogue with your friends because you are too uncomfortable or too polite to say what is on your mind.  The scene about catching Harold in the act truly stretched my imagination.  The amounts of money thrown around boggled my mind.  And the ending?  It reminded me of the last episode of Seventh Heaven 
 I'll tell you why.:  Little story, my husband surprised me with a GS puppy last year when I came back from a weeklong vacation. I did not want a puppy yet because I've never owned a dog before and I wanted to do some reading on the subject, especially with a GS. It's not the kind of breed that you can just buy and say "ok, we have a cute puppy" and that's it. Every dog deserves a well informed owner. But I ended up using my intuition and common sense to do the majority of training for my dog (who I now love dearly). This book taught me nothing that I hadn't already figured out on my own. And I must add that there is only about 10% of this book that is actually geared towards GS's. It's a very broad based book on how to train a dog, not just a GS. There are many other books out there that will tell you about the breed and what to expect about there intelligience, personality and the AKC standards for this breed. I learned more things browsing through GS magazines at PetSmart. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK !!!! There are MUCH better books about German Shepherds !!!!!! 
 I am doing research for an upcoming trip to Shangri-la region, and this is the first English book I read on the subject.  It did not offer much information on anything other than some very limited history of the exploration in the Tsangpo River Gorge region.  Since the names of places used in the book is different from those used in another Chinese book I read before, I had hard time cross-referencing and squeezing any useful information out of this book at all.  Book reads like a C+ to B- college term paper on the subject.  
 i must say, when i set out to read this book i was looking for a quick book of short stories. This book has two majorly poor qualities: the majority of it is not understandalbe and the other parts are boring 
 I bought this book to inspire me to do what I had already set my mind to do anyway. Would I have taken the leap without having read the book? Yes. In fact, I did in spite of the book's uninspiring examples, which instead of encouraging me, nearly discouraged me.  Perhaps a better  title would be DO WHAT YOU LOVE AND THE MONEY WON'T MATTER, maybe then I wouldn't have been so disappointed with the examples. I've found that by doing what I love, I don't NEED vacations, new clothes, entertaintment, etc., nor the money  necessary to buy those things to fill the emptiness of unfulfilled life.  Am I happier doing what I love, without the money? Yes, a million times happier. (And I've been doing this for 10 years.) But I agree with other reviewers before me, Joseph Campbell is more inspiring.  
 Maybe it's just the geek in me crying out for mercy, but I find a lot of the details of this book pretty far-fetched.  Plus, after we figured out whodunit and such, it just seemed to drag on forever.  I ended up skimming the last 30 pages or so just to get it over with.  I thought it was OK, but it definitely caters to a less technically savvy audience than I : 
 this album is and always will be an original gangsta album to the fullest with above its time production and hard real life lyrics.....no female artist comes close, NONE point blank..... to date that is.......they were the FIRST TO PUT DETROIT ON THE MA 
 Mr. Simmons's story is a cautionary tale of lies and deception.  He is delusional about the lack of recovery and involves those who love him in his "quicksand of lies and cruelty."   He claims to have loved those who care for him and yet he hurts them and worst, expose them to the risk HIV/AIDS with his reckless behavior.  I had hoped to read further his story redemption and atonement for those he had hurt that he claimed to love.   There is no such ending 
 I have located several misquotations and several mispellings of what little Greek she uses. Apart from it being gruesomely written, I suspect this woman does not know Antigone in Greek--she quotes widely from other sources but prefers to stay away from the original. I am tempted to at a later date say with Voltaire "I am sitting in the smallest room of the house. I have your book in front of me--soon it will be behind me&quot 
 First let me start by saying that Manji has very little knowledge of Islam for someone who claims to have gone to an Islamic school.  I will not say madrasa, because the word has been misused, purposely, to give darker skinned peoples an exotic barbarity. The word simply means school and is used, worldwide, to refer to schools both secular and religious, simply coming from the Arabic root "to study."    I do not understand why Manji rants and raves over and over about ijtihad  (reasoning independent of the past religious opinions), but one thing is for sure, and that is that she has no knowledge of Muslim movements of the 18th centuries onwards.  One of the most successful movements, founded by Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab, known as Wahhabism by those opposed to it or Salafism by its proponents, has as its founding principle the use of ijtihad, as it wished to break from what it considered was corruption of Islam by all Islamic groups and empires after the community of the Prophet.   However, ibn Abdul Wahhab's followers had to change his theories, as he only accepted the Qur'an and Sunna (the traditions of the prophet), but these traditions were not collected with any authority until the 9th century, meaning in order to claim the Sunna, the Wahhabi's would have to accept the consensus of the first 3 centuries of Islam (which includes the Golden Age).  The problem with the Wahhabi's is that they are a exceptionally right wing, and so their independent analysis (ijtihad) is inherently conservative.  Why doesn't Manji know this.  It is not a hidden fact.  She doesn't even need to learn Arabic to find this out, it is written plainly for anyone with knowledge of English.  You don't need a comprehensive study of Islam to know this, though you would think it should be a prerequisite for anyone claiming to have the ability to tell the world of the trouble with Islam 
 If looked as a parady of some other books it was some what  amusing. But very heavy handed 
 After 36 years my all metal corkscrew came apart in my hands.  This one is flimsy in comparison and there is no way that I think it will last even 20 years 
 I was very excited to see another Valentine horror movie coming out; the last one I remember was My Bloody Valentine about some Cole Minor named Harry Nabob or something like that, very bad film.  But Valentine looked like it would be good and it was actually until the ending.   The pretty boy being the killer again is just played out.  Scream was good everything else is just redundant.  Imagine if the geeky boy who was attacked by the bullies actually got burned or his face was horribly deformed in a fall or something like that.  He goes to the mental institution and years later he escapes or is released into society, but escaped is much better.  This masked figure then chases down the mean kids and kills them one by one, then the climax when we see his face it shows the reason he is so angry and deranged.   I give it 2 stars because it could have been so good and I can always pretend the ending was good 
 While this book may give some basic ideas that are useful to keep in mind while you are trying to understand your relationships with others, in the end it is just another attempt to give people answers they want even though such answers don't exist.  I'll admit that being a first or second born might have a general effect on your personality, but just how far can we take this kind of analysis?  The author of this book goes so far to offer that by knowing your own birth order and that of your same-sex parent, he can determine the birth order of your ideal match.  My father was 3rd and I was 2nd, thus I should pair with a 4th born.  Anyone who thinks about that for five seconds should realize that it is totally bogus pseudo-science.  There are too many factors involved to be able to make such predictions.  Not every Nth born is the same, and no relationship between Nth and Mth borns can be analysed this way.  As with astrology, the only thing this book can do is unnecessarily deter you from pursuing relationships with people just because they are the wrong "sign".  Who's to say I won't get along with a 2nd born?  Rather than relying on voodoo like this, we are better off just paying attention to how we actually get along with other individuals 
 I purchased this camera for my two grandchildren.  I was truly disappointed in the product, and I think the kids were too; as they showed no real interest in using it or playing with and that was immediate.  
 This novel relies too much on far fetched ideas and coincidences.  I thought it was boring 
 I found myself skimming through entire pages of this book trying to get at the meat of the matter. While the plot was interesting, I think it could have been better told as a short story. I found the novel to be unbelievable and the characters to be shallow. The writing style left a lot to be desired. I had four pages left to read in this book and had no problem putting it down for the night before finishing.  
 I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life 
 cannot find the satalite code for my direct tv, the other codes work for the tv,vcr and dvd. please solve this proble 
 Barely gave it two stars but this film is dull. Although it took a different approach, this film had nothing there for me.Wow, a killer taking hostages for a poker game. I'm really dumbfounded other than that. NEEDLESS TO SAY IT WAS BAD BUT NOT HORRIBLE. AND WHAT THE HELL IS WITH ALL THE DUBBED ACCENTS?  IF THE VIEWER WANTS TO SEE BLOOD AND CREATIVITY, DON'T PUT THIS IN YOUR DVD PLAYER! 
 THIS IS THE WORST SONG I LISTED TO IN MY LIFE  IT SOUND LIKE A BANRE 
 This is a terrible movie that I gave 1 star because I couldn't give any fewer. It features the usual idols given primarily to the black youth of today, hip hoppers playing gangstas who have no respect for anything or anyone other than money. It is another one of those blaxploitation specials in which there is literally no figure of any redeeming value. This explains the  almost endless series of beatings, shootings, and overall ignorance portrayed in sequence, and served up as some sort of story. It's only entertainment they say, but they are typecast without even knowing it, foolishly dying to portray a fantasy image...psychologically bound as tight as any slave was ever shackeled 
 ...to see just how bad it is. Unlike it's predecessor Heavy Metal 2k has one single 90 minute story arch talking place in the far future, using both hand drawn animation and very bad CGI, bad even for 2000. The basic plot is that a miner named Tyler (Michael Ironsides) stumbles across a green glowing crystal that is a literal key to the fountain of youth. The only draw back is that the moment he touches it Tyler goes completely bonkers and starts killing a lot of people.  The "Key" draws Tyler to a settlement called Eden, full of people who haves traces of the life giving compound in them, giving them a healthy good looking looks, Tyler probtly kills half of the population and kidnaps the rest, a lone survivor of the raid Julie (Julie Strian) begins a blind quest of revenge.  Everything that could be bad in any given movie is bad in HM2K, the dialog is terrible, both written and performed, the camera work is terrible, there's no back story to speak of, tere are loop holes that even a baby can see, not even a connection to the first firm with the Loc-Nar, which the key is suppose to be a shard from, except that it's green. Also there are not special features on this DVD!!!!!  I don't mind the violence or the nudity, in fact I want to see more of that in western animation, but this movie is just as forgettable as any other movie that Julie Strian stars in.  
 After having seen many Gene Wilder movies as a child and recalling they generally were funny I acquired a few of them recently for my collection. While "See no evil Hear no evil" generally disappointed it certainly had its moments - unfortunately the same cannot be said about this movie. It was poorly acted, slapstick, pie-throwing humour which anyone with more than 6 years in school would find utterly depressing.  There were not even 3 partly amusing scenes or jokes and the continued return to the movie director beating up his assistant while his management team sweet talked him was among the absolute low points. It is not clear to me who the target audience was for this movie when it was created - and an excuse could be if it was meant for 3-7 year olds... otherwise humour has certainly changed since these days...  If the scale made it possible to give negative number of stars this would have been a prime candidate. Dont see it .. even if someone offers you money to do so 
 This item is supposedly titled "UFOs: The First Encounters." It is, however, an episode about reincarnation. It is incorrectly labeled. DO NOT PURCHASE unless you are looking for an episode on reincarnation 
 This review has to start with a couple of admissions.  First, I happen to think Cyndi Lauper (especially in her later albums) is an underrated songwriter and performer.  Most people think of her as a pop-culture icon of the 80's and unfortunately dismiss what she's done since then.  Some of her later ballads are sung with great emotion and are among the best-written songs I've ever heard.  On the other hand, I really HATE remixes, especially when they're done solely to try to make "danceable" a song that was never intended to be dance music.  So I approached this album with a mix of excitement and fear... excitement that the "rarities" would be more of Cyndi's great songwriting and fear that the remixes would suck, as remixes tend to do.  The two rarities on the album are the songs "The World is Stone" and "You Have to Learn to Live Alone".  There are also extended versions of "Mother" and "What's Going On".  "The World is Stone" talks about how people are turning to stone, "cold to the touch and hard on the soul".  The instrumentals are acceptable but nothing special.  Cyndi's vocals convey the emotional message she's sending exceptionally well, and it's a well-written message about there being "no warmth anymore" and "no love anymore".  While it may be a "rarity" it is definitely one of her better and more powerful songs.  "You Have to Learn to Live Alone" has a kind of blues or jazz sound to it.  You could imagine it being sung in a smoky nightclub in Casablanca.  Cyndi pulls off the kind of vocals you expect with the music, delivering a powerful and emotional performance in the context of what's a fairly subdued, soft song.  The instrumentals on this song are much better than those for "The World is Stone".  The rest of the album consists of remixes, and as I said above, I generally hate remixes.  These are really no exception.  If I had to describe the remixes on this album in a single sentence, that sentence would be: "How to turn some decent Cyndi Lauper music into something unrecognizable and crappy."  If you're into the techno-sounding disco stuff, you might enjoy these, I don't know.  Personally, they ruin some decent songs to me.  The only good thing I can find to say about them is that at least they didn't mess with some of her better songs and stuck with the more mainstream stuff like "Hey Now (Girls Just Wanna Have Fun)"...    If the entire album was like "The World is Stone" and "You Have to Learn to Live Alone" I would probably give it something in the 8-10 (out of 10) range.  Those two songs are quite good and easily among her best work.  But the 6 remixes on the album pretty much ruin it for me, and I can't in good conscience give the entire album anything better than about a 4.  If it was an album of just the remixes, it would get maybe a 2, and would only rank that high because Cyndi's voice appears in them 
 This book got great reviews and was recommended to me by someone whose taste I trust, but I've got to say, I just don't understand its appeal.  It starts out as mildly intriguing, and some of the scenes with the unwed mothers in the first section are evocative, but the lovably twinkly and clairvoyant old nun is just too saccharine to bear, and the narrator of the middle section, salt-of-the-earth gardener Son, is not only too good to be true, he's also deathly boring--a dull-witted drone.  I've read Bel Canto and The Patron Saint of Liars only confirms my belief that Ann Patchett's novels are overrated.  
 Jesus Christ is Yahweh.  Yancey doesn't understand that.  God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.  God NEVER changes.  God is Holy Trinity.  God in the Old Testament is Holy Trinity.  God in the New Testament is Holy Trinity.  God now is Holy Trinity.  When Jesus Christ comes back, God will be Holy Trinity.  God will be Holy Trinity forever as He was before the Creation of the World.  Thus, Jesus Christ who is God the Son is Yahweh of the Old Testament.  Anyone who teaches otherwise is going to HELL because he doesn't know Christ personally 
 I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent.  This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading.  The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful.  I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed.  I ask you  how many women do you know that use a term like "skirt hound" for a man who chases women?  I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me!  It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue.  Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one 
 This book is so bad. The first two chapters are good,But each page gets worse and worse after that. The only reason i finished the book was because i was waiting for it to get better. I live in new york. This book has nothing to do with new york in any way. When i first saw the books cover i thought.. this should be a good book. Boy was i wrong. 
 Nothing can prepare you for this work. No one in the history of literature has written with more pretentiousness and self-indulgence. How Pessoa can present himself as both pathetic and heroic at the same time is a miracle of narcissism. In contemporary terms this is like an adolescent blog. He dismally attempts to disguise his platitudes as lyrical profundity 
 Time was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books' recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.  The very first "Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company's kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company's bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.    The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you'll never see their likes again.  The current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the "dump and stir" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.  Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.    It's obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.  The "Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.  It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker's had in some time.  Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks' Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen.  Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called "The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook."  The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.  It's a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there's even better stuff out there now.  Go for it! 
 I really liked the first book--A Skeleton in God's Closet--as kind of a DaVinci Code alternative.  I was really looking forward to this one, but just could not get into it.   Besides all the alcohol usage and the semi-suggestive love scenes, the main character hardly seems to be a spiritual person. (The same issues could be raised in the first book, but the plot really [...] in.)   While I agree with much of the author's eschatology, I dislike the way that he makes fun of and dismisses so many Christians who hold the popular dispensational view.  Not all dispensationalists are raving lunatics.  Many have very solid minsitries--men like John MacArthur, Chuck Swindoll, Erwin Lutzer, Joe Stowell, Woodrow Kroll, Warren Wiersbe and countless others.  It seems that the author thinks more highly of the pope than evangelcials who hold a different eschatology.  However, there is a little chart in the book that illustrates all the different millennial views.  I used it in my Sunday school class and it was very helpful.  Bottom line--just too much stuff I want to read for me to stick with this one.  Disappointed 
 Yes, there are flaws in Kinsey's statistics and sometimes his methods were unethical. These two problems still exist today. But I think this book goes too far. There are no references to back up the "facts". It was written by a journalist with no credentials except that she is on a lifetime crusade to repress people's sexuality. It is published by Ascension Press, a religious publisher. Of course it is going to denounce his work. This publisher represents people who live by the bible and Kinsey's research does not follow the bible. So why does that make it wrong? I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone with a brain. 
 I could have written this book.  It's full of cliches and doesn't really provide any guidance for how to go about changing bad habitats.  I was bored after the first chapter.  If you want to read a great book that actually accomplishes what this author couldn't, read Stephen Covey's 7 Habitats of Highly Successful People.  It'll blow you away! 
 I have waited until I finally received a working model to post my experience with Logitech.   First, let me begin by saying that now that I have a working Audio Station I really do love it.  The product deserves the excellent iLounge review it received.  The sound is great.  It has an audio in port and an S-Video out port on the back.  I cannot for the life of me understand why there are $300 units made by Apple and Bose that are nothing more than some speakers.  Additionally, the AM/FM tuner works well.  I really only use the FM tuner but have found it to be good - better than I expected but not perfect.  However, once again, most units at this price point do not have any sort of AM/FM tuner and that was a sacrifice I was not willing to make.  For all of these reasons I really do like the Audio Station.  However, if there was even another product on the market with these characteristics (AM/FM, S-Video out, audio in) I would have taken my business elsewhere in a second.  My experience with Logitech was TERRIBLE.  First, I brought home a unit from Best Buy in early February and found that it was one of a bad batch that went out to Best Buy stores (see other reviews on this page for more details on which units have the problem with buttons not responding).  After the buttons on the front of the unit didn't respond I got online and read the reviews posted here on Amazon as well as on Logitech's own website where they finally admitted that this was a flawed product.  I then contacted Logitech to see about having a product sent to me as part of the warranty.  The representative at Logitech told me I would be better off taking my unit back to Best Buy.  I realized that I knew more about the problem with the Audio Station than the customer service rep did after only about 20 minutes of poking around online.  I told him that apparantly a bad batch went out to Best Buy stores and the last thing I was going to do was to waste my time returning a product to Best Buy only to bring another faulty unit back home.  I also told him that I'd read that Audio Stations coming directly from the factory were reportedly working fine and I wanted one of those.  After some time on the phone we arranged for my unit to be picked up and then I would receive a new unit in 10 days.  10 days later I called.  This was the first time I found out that the unit was out of stock and my order was on backorder.  I was furious that I had to call to find out the item was on backorder.  Not only was this the first I heard of the problem but there was nothing they could do for me.  I was told the first week of March they would recieve some in the warehouse.  I waited.  About 8 days into March I called again.  The order hadn't made it to the warehouse.  A small order was due to arrive but it was not guaranteed that I would get one of them.  Again, I was very displeased but there was nothing I could do.    This was the first time that a customer representative seemed to know what he was talking about and actually served as an advocate for me.  To their credit, I did recieve a unit out of that first batch.  It arrived relatively quickly and works fine.  However, it was a terrible, terrible experience along the way.  If you buy one of these, I guarantee buying directly from the factory.  Logitech does not seem inclined to recall their bad units and appears to be content with letting customers deal with their problem.  If you do buy from Best Buy or from Amazon, be careful - you may receive one of the flawed units and who knows how long it will take a replacement to get to you.  It basically took Logitech 7 weeks to get me a new model.  I've never had so much trouble giving a company $300 of my money.  I plan to never shop with Logitech again 
 I am a huge fan of Ms Morrison. IMO she should have won a Pulitzer for "The Bluest Eye". But I find her increasingly difficult to understand. Beginning with "Beloved", Ms. Morrison novels have taken on a mystical quality that bewilder and confuse me. Often I have to go back and re-read pages to find out which character is speaking or remembering or dreaming or what. I gave up on this one somewhere in the middle. I am now plowing through "Love" in which she uses the same tactic and it's a guessing game. I really wish she would return to her earlier style as exhibited in "The Bluest Eye", "Sula" and "Song of Solomon".  
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 Thank God. I checked this book out at the library. It would have been a waste of money to buy it. I found it to be boring so I pressed on reading up to chapter 15 but it didn't get any better so the book went back unfinished. I think the controversy around this book was mainly for publicity to get people to buy it. It's so sad that most were disappointed 
 I have read Liar's Poker, and Bombardiers, you are no Liar's Poker. Not even close. The characters are poorly developed, the dialogue is uneven, the scenarios are utterly and completely unrealistic. All in all, an incredibly painful read. If you haven't read Liar's Poker and are considering reading this book, read Liar's Poker instead; if you have already read Liar's Poker and are considering reading this book, read Liar's Poker again. It's that bad 
 The first season of Six Feet Under featured astonishing acting/writing/directing, and was a truly and amazing new show. However, the show began to lag part way into the second season. It lost its witty death related humor, and began to lose the format of the original shows. The decline of the second season culminated in a cliché cliff hanger, typical of shows that don't know how to maintain interest. Season three starts with a confusing premier which includes a massive jump in time that ejects the viewer out of the show, and further illustrates the writers' budding ability NOT to deal with tough issues. By season four the show has fully declined into a rather lame and incongruent night time soap, with the standard love triangles, mystery deaths, and psychics. They have also managed to fully lose their format, that of the beginning death dictating the tone of the show. One of the episodes starts with a death based on an anti-LSD agenda, and after the first scene they completely ignore the issues and the kid who died. I'm pretty sure Fisher Sons and Diaz didn't even embalm the guy. At some point the massive amount of useless sex they have added to the show, and the extended kidnapping episodes become nothing more than unpredictable and uninteresting. If you enjoy the first season of Six Feet Under, quit while you are ahead. However, if you enjoy shows like Alias, Lost, and Days of Our Lives, with their cliff hangers, disjointed action, and love octagons, then i would advise you to PARTY ON!, and enjoy the last few seasons.  BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for good TV, the kind where pain, humor, and love dance in a similar fashion to life, watch the first season and don't waist time on the rest. If you just love characters no matter how strange they are written, continue by all means; the plot doesn't get worse, just the writing acting and directing.  PORN FACTOR: By season four people are just having random sex, and the story lines seem to be a little better then bottom of the barrel porn. So, i guess, good soft core porn for the win 
 The book reads very textbook-y, and already that's one strike against it. There were a few interesting things, like bundling beds and the fact that Pilgrims thought that women had to climax to conceive but other than that, nothing too insightful about sex 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 This book seemed like most Computer books I read.  Define the problem and then a procedural step by step list of how to "solve" the problem.  It just seems cold, calulating and impersonal.  This may work with computers, but not with something living. The book just lists the steps, and if your cat doesn't follow the steps listed, oh well.  The author also seems to be streaching to reach the 50 training tips mentioned in the title as most seemed to come natural to my cats or were common sense to me 
 Okay, now, for all of you who are expecting a book that teaches interesting morals and cool things in it, put this book away right now!!! Put it into a dusty corner and whenever you may catch a glimpse of it, laugh in a malicious tone because you haven't feasted your eyes on the most stupid book ever written!! This book ends with such a melancholy abruption that I thought I might be witnessing the severe chopping of a movie gone over far too many minutes. This book...is horrendous. -ANGRY READER 
 Datlow & Windling's backpatting of personal acquaintances is the basis of their editorial choices, and adherence to political doctrine. Their "years best"  collection for 2000 includes Ursula Le Guin twice,  and this authors writing is little more then fanciful icing to make her  de-hydrated cause (feminism in this case) more palatable 
 This is the only textbook we used for our OS class at university. My interests lie in systems programming and some low-level interfacing using high level languages but this book really didn't help me much. I was looking forward to this subject but disappointed because the lecturer basically took this book as the bible and made no references to other sources. If this book was to create a religion and my lecturer was the pope then I wouldn't be surprised if there were so many factions like in Christianity...because of the confusing presentation of the subject. Half of the time I was consulting Google because of the nearly useless examples in the book. At one point I was arguing about a vaguely explained topic with my lecturer. I was using other texts as my references but unfortunately my lecturer was pushing his own interpretation of the topic 
 I thought thet this movie was the WORST movie ever based on the talent that was involved.  I don't think that Yuen Wah could have been any worse.  Jet Li was pretty good, but how the hell do you screw that up.  Tsui Hark seemingly didn't rush through this movie, but it still turns out horribley.  I would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad, but I'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse 
  I dunno, I'm kind of skeptical about taking fatherly advice from a guy who thinks that incest is just a sign of a repressed society, and who's gone on record saying that date rape used to be just a good time. Hm, a good time for whom, one wonders?     Farrell likes to leave out certain facts. Like, for example, his complaints about how men die sooner and work more dangerous jobs. The former is proof of what, exactly?   The latter is disingenuous---men work more dangerous jobs from wihch women are excluded because these jobs tend to pay better. Then the danger is used as an excuse to keep women out of those jobs because the little ladies need protection, for which men of the Farrell type expect gratitude.  Farrell mentions at some point that almost no women died in the Viet Nam war. This is becuase women weren't allowed to FIGHT in the Viet Nam war at all.  And so forth and so on.      
 The worst book I've read (actually, I was listening to the audiobook).  The characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that I found myself YELLING at the tape player, "I KNOW, I KNOW ALREADY".  I couldn't stand the torture anymore, I didn't even finish it.  I have enjoyed some of DS's earlier work, but will not buy another 
 I am schooled in the age appropriateness of literature and film as an educator and now a mom. I know what my child can grasp cognitavely and emotionally, and this one just did not sit well with me at all. I hadn't read any reviews and when my 2+ year old daughter had started to collect care bears as I did at her age, I saw this movie and decided to buy it. This movie is the reason I now read reviews on movies before I buy them for my precious children! I think I had seen this movie as a child but I did not not recall just how scary this movie is for very young children.  My daughter watched it and told me she didn't like the "evil spirit" that is the actual name of the evil character in the movie. I would fast forward through those scenes- but the scary scenes actually make up most of the movie! I hid the movie from her after I saw what it was doing to her. My child had bad dreams and wouldn't sleep for weeks. I gave the movie to her older girl cousins who said they wanted it, but I feel bad because I know it is a horrible movie for any audience. It would have been best for preschoolers to have left the creepy villains out and kept only the care bears and cousins in a care free adventure. Not the case with this one folks! The real reason we bought the movie was to see the lovable care bears. If your kids love care bears do NOT buy this movie or they will soon become their least favorite toys- even scare bears.  Trust me, it is just that bad!!If you are looking for a cutesy care bear movie-a good new one is The Care Bears Big Wish movie- my daughter enjoys that one now 
 Although it could be more, this book is only an in depth historical study of the prophets from a Jewish perspective.  However, as Christians, we know that Jesus came to fulfill the law and the prophets. The prophets in this study were warning the Jewish people, but they were also foretelling the good news about Jesus Christ, the Messiah. Yet, Heschel ignores this essential purpose of God for the prophets. Yes, the prophets had a profound place in the history of the Jewish people, and, even though Heschel ignores the truth, and glosses over key verses like Isaiah 7:14, the prophets' message is not confined to that small time or that people in history, as Heschel would have us believe, but is still relevant to all of us today to point the way to Jesus Christ as the Savior and Deliverer of the whole world 
 Beware----The Cadbury from Netgrocer's is not the creamy UK Cadbury.  It the Hershey Cadbury from the US.  The difference between the two is like the difference between a Miller and a fresh Guiness 
 What a sad book! Read the book and you'll notice how she  preaches depression as the main theme of being a female.Her  answer wouldn't ya know is a psychiatrict drug,Prozaic.Bad idea! I've known many people who have been dupped into taking this  drug,both men and women,the results were heightened bipolar  disorder,paranoia and more depression.It's a sales pitch  for drugs. She wants women to be drug dependent,out of controll of their  lives,helpless.The book does not empower women,it is a depressing book,written to horrify women and get them obsessing  about their every thought and mood. The premise is,all women are more or less the same,she couldn't be further from the truth Be a weary consumer,both in advice and drugs

 I had this book for a college class and it is terrible. I found it to be very, very vague on it's topics and just barely skims the surface. The diagrams are drawings, and they are not very good for the representation. If you want to learn about equine science, this is not the book 
 This was the required text for a comparative studies course I took on Ancient China and if it wasn't for the help of my prof I would have been lost completely.  Even he said it was difficult to understand and he has been studying China for decades.  This book was simply a mess of facts.  The author should have worked more on the order of the content he was stuffing into this book.  I give it two stars because of the great images it provides.  But, at the end of the day, images will not teach you about China.  The author may have covered a variety of Chinese history and provided nice pictures, but it doesn't do any good if it is simply scattered over the pages.  I am a deans list student but not after this book.  A China lover would enjoy the overview but take some Tylenol with it.  
 Saw the previews of the first movie, but I wasn't expecting too much from that. I tried to finish both the first and the second, but that didn't work out too well...I felt these films didn't deserved to be watched all the way to the end. I don't know how some of y'all were able to sit through this poor excuse of a movie, and that includes the first. All I really have to say is you if you like this movie or maybe a better version of it...Y'all should really consider watching Cops and those insane police chases shown on TV. After all this is just another episode of Cops with guest actors in it 
 I'm not a big fan of short stories as it is, but I love the era of the 40's and 50's. Seeing as how that's the era these women are from, I figured I really enjoy this. Well, I was wrong. The book focuses more on the women when their older...much older.   But that wasn't why I didn't like this book. What I didn't like was the writing style. Not AT ALL. It was extremely choppy, and I found it to be difficult to follow in many places. And the women themselves...I just didn't care for them. They were a very weird bunch, and I thought they were a bit eccentric for no apparent reason.  Overall, not a book I recommend. But as I said, I'm also not a big short story reader. I picked this up thinking I was in for some easy, light reading...but that wasn't the case. Hope you have better luck with it 
 To compare this with the Smiths the Furs and the Cure..? is a sacrilege. It is far from those bands, not remotely in their league, and not even close to their sound..  Its lite bouncy uninspired pop. Which is fine, but please be honest with musical comparisons, perhaps listen to the refered bands before using them as a reference 
 I finally gave up reading this joke around page 200. Doss is an amateur writer who breaks all the conventions of good writing, not for effect but out of incompetence. He is melodramatic and has dialogue that is absolutely unnatural and unconvincing. Doss has accomplished one thing with his writing--he has made it possible to feel pain while reading. Who else can describe two men eating animal crackers as: "...when the animal cookies had been decimated by the pair of voracious carnivores"? Please 
 If you are looking for Government regulated information, then you will find it in this book. I was looking forward to reading this book and learning from it, yet I find myself more than disappointed. Her views on natural medicine, herbs, and the like are far from enlightened or open. She has a dim view of anything not viewed from "scientific research". This book reminds me of the government propaganda in the 50's and 60's. I honestly would like to rate this lower, but the scale doesn't allow it. I will be glad to rid myself of this book 
 What can I say about the truly inspired film "Havoc" that hasn't been said before?  Barbara Kopple, an Academy Award winning documentarian, taking a grittily realistic look at urban youth dabbling in gang culture--sounds like a recipe for success!  Add a talented cast of appealing up-and-coming actors given really meaty roles--awesome!  Not so much...  "Havoc" is, unfortuanately, an unmitigated disaster.  You won't believe your eyes.  The kids, the gangs, the streets of L.A.--everything just rings so false.  The last time I saw so many posers "playing" street toughs was at my Junior High auditions for "Grease".  And I think we could have taken these kids.  A lot has been made about the "shocking" sexual content of the film.  Anyone "shocked" by this movie probably doesn't see very many movies.  Anne Hathaway does appear naked, which seems to be a selling point, but she and everyone else deserves better.  I'd actually have rated the movie about a 4--because it's a campy mess!!!  If someone had realized that this was a B-level exploitation flick, and sold it as such--I'd have bought into it.  No, though.  This is a "serious movie" and "important" document of our time.  Sadly, on that scale, these kids need to go back to school because they failed 
 This is a very cheaply made reproduction of Malfoy's wand.  Whether you buy it or not probably depends on who it's for.  It would be great for a very small kid who will lose or break it, as it's cheap and made of plastic.  However for anyone else who craes about detail and feel, you might as well be waving around a wooden dowel 
 I almost always finish books, but I gave up here after 3/4. It's just a string of facts tied loosely together. If it was 1/2 as long and more tightly focused I would have recommended it 
 I found the book very difficult to use and almost never had what I was looking for.  The small dictionary in the back of my eyewitness travel guide was much more useful 
 William's-Sonoma has an excellent recipe book layout; their bright colorful pictures and easy-to-read text always make a nice impression on me. While selecting my first trial recipes I noticed that if a person wanted to, he or she could preplan menus with this book. Many of the soups call for similar base ingredients and stocks so different soups could be created on consecutive days.  I've tried two recipes out of this book, one was excellent and the other was a disaster. I thought that the vegetable stock recipe is incredible and know that I will use it again; it is incredibly full of flavor and healthy. I cannot say the same about the split pea soup recipe.  The pea soup recipe sounded like a nice idea but it was not creamy enough to my taste. In fact, it wasn't creamy at all. The soup turned out gritty and chewy with a poor texture. I think that the recipe has some good flavor possibilities but needs more work to incorporate a smoother texture with more liquid that will allow the dried peas to adequately cook.  Maybe I just picked the worst recipe out of the book to try first but a 50/50 likelihood of recipe failure makes me hesitant to try another recipe 
 Another reviewer called this CD "a shadow of what might have been". That is perfectly stated. Far from a die-hard Mannheim fan, I acknowledge Davis's frequent mastery of instrumentation. Perhaps it was my own expectations that led me to hope that there would be a better-than-average payoff between Davis & this genre. Despite a great deal of snobby classical music in my own background, I am not opposed to remakes when they add a new dimention or showcase a subtlty that has, heretofore, been overlooked. This effort doesn't even qualify for decent, party background music. Just when I thought, well, maybe I can play it at the teenage Halloween party for my niece (many selections have a reliable bass rhythm) out comes his version of The Sorcerer's Apprentice -- zero logic. Clearly this was just a cash cow attempt at capitalizing on the holiday 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 I have read all of Kiyosaki's books and there are several that are outstanding.  I like Trump's earlier books better.  However, this book was just terrible if you have read anything by either of the two.  It is really a disappointment for the the two of them to collaborate on this one.  It appears they took excerpts from their other books and used cliches all over the place.  It was poorly written, offered little new advice or foresight, and was a major disappointment.  They spent too much time just talking about how they decided to write the book...Save your money for retirement and buy an earlier book of either of the two 
 This book is about a Jewish girl named Hannah Green who flees from Spain in fear of the Spanish Inquisition after witnessing her mother being captured and burned alive at the stakes for being a Jew.  She comes to England with her father and lives as a Christian while following the Jewish religion in secrecy.  Through a chain of events she becomes a royal fool and a spy - for both Queen Mary and Elizabeth.   Throughout the book Hannah talks about how she misses her mother and can still smell her mother's burning flesh from the stakes and then also professes her love for Queen Mary and what a wonderful woman she is.  It is well documented in history as well as this book about Queen Mary's burning of hundreds of non-Catholics at the stakes.  A practice that earned her the name - Bloody Mary.  The book is very sympathetic towards Queen Mary and portrays her as a virtuous woman who believed that she was burning people for their own sake - "only doing what she believed to be right in her heart".    The fact that Hannah was living her life in fear of being discovered as a Jew and continued to deeply love Queen Mary was extremely unbelievable and ridiculous. I could not help but roll my eyes every time I read how much Hannah loved and admired Queen Mary.  
 The author is a sociologist and tells of testing the opinions of two groups as to OJ's guilt. [There was no test as to the extent of their actual knowledge!] You won't learn anything new from this book. It has a long list of books on the subject, but the author gave no ratings or summaries on them. Were they all equal in quality?   The OJ case received more publicity than the Oklahoma City bombing or the Clinton impeachment. The National Association of Editors and Publishers has never told of the reasons for its play in the news. Could it have been intended as a distraction from other news? In May 1994 the newspapers carried stories on how North Korea was ready to attack and start a war; this was repeated weekly. In 1999 I read that President Carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to North Korea (must have been a success, since the propaganda stopped).   Could the double murders in Brentwood have been well-publicized as a distraction? Isn't two murders a day the usual LA statistics? How many other waiters (just from Mezzaluna) were murdered each year? Are murders by organized crime often solved?  The book "Killing Time" noted that restaurants and health clubs (in LA and elsewhere) were often used a fronts for drug dealing and prostitution. If this explains the murders, you won't find much in this book. [My experience is that most white Americans made up their minds in June 1994 and never let the new facts interfere with their prejudgment.] 
 I am a person responsible for creating several orginal books, created out of nothing, adding to the public good, inspiring many, creating all kinds of jobs. I COULD NOT DISAGREE MORE with this Professor, another communist loosing himself and his ideas on our society. Why should my creation be at some point given away free to who, other publishers who can then publish it and make ALL the money. THERE is no such thing as FREE in this world, expect apparantly to overly idealistic Professors who do not live in the real world. Instead of only lengthening the term of Copyright for twenty years and then giving my creation away, they should let me and my family own it forever. Of course if this Prof actually created something that really connected with society and sold for decades I wonder who he would want to keep any earnings it might make. When is the BIG SCHOOL MONOPOLY with all their pie in the sky professors going to stop blaming BIG BUSINESS for all societies evils when in this case my copyright is all I have to support my family. I suppose the next book this nitwit will write will be about how all property owners and home owners should not own their homes and property but they should be open and useable and `owned' by all.   
 There are no new concepts put forth in this book, and worse, it's filled with painful stabs at humor, practically worthless information (most of which seemingly to get the reader from one picture to the next).  I just don't think many people realize that Meadows has rewritten existing ideas as little "revelations" he has had himself, and so, I advise any prospective shoppers to move on, look toward online journals or monthly magazines in this field (like Speculative Reviews of Narrative, etc).  There's nothing to see here 
 I just got through watching this Dmytryk film on TCM tonight, and all I can say is that if you are looking for the George Peppard who played Paul Varjak in Breakfast at Tiffany's, forget it.  In fact, he is so cold and so stiff (I realize he's trying to play a nasty Howard Hughes knockoff), that a cardboard figurine would have been just as convincing in his stead.  Outside of great costumes and sets, this movie is long and boring.  Where it's not boring it's a snicker inducing raunchfest.  Poor Alan Ladd in his final role, barely having to act as he plays a drunken hasbeen, and Elizabeth Ashley who is the only redeeming character in the entire plot and also resembles Audrey Hepburn to a scary degree in the last half of this debacle.  Carroll Baker may be sexy in her lingerie, but she's so over-the-top with her heavy breathing and her lingerie that you actually want to cheer when her car goes off the road.  I can think of better ways to pass my time for 2 and 1/2 hours than this...like watching the mating rituals of moth-eaten underwear.  Still, you just can't stop watching it through to its unrealistic ending.  If I'd have thought beating up one of my old flames after years of his acting like a total jag would have changed him overnight, I'd have done it long ago!  If you must see this lousy piece of 60's smut, make sure you rent it or come across it on TV before you go buying it.  I've seen corpses that are more convincing than Peppard was in this flick!         
 I bought this book 2 years ago - almost to the day...I have the receipt stuck in the book...I can only seem to force myself to get to page 50 and then I just can't stomach anymore and I put it down for 2 more years. Maybe this is a piece of art. Something to be treasured and something that should change your life. But pleasure reading shouldn't be this painful. I wish the store would take it back - but I think I've probably had it for too long 
 The author has a talent for making even interesting topics deadly dull. forget this one 
 I have read a lot of books on value investing.  This book is really thinly recycled gruel.   It presents the value basics, but in a way that would not be terribly useful to a person who has never heard of value investing.  For example, one technique he recommends is to calculate the price people might pay to buy a company in a leveraged buyout (LBO), and then buy at a discount to that.   Now, if you are person who can accurately make that calculation--no easy thing for the man on the street--do you need a book that tells you that market timing is bad and you should buy stocks when they are 'on sale' and 'here is what a P/E ratio is'?  On the other hand, in a way the book is not detailed enough.  Browne has for years put out a little booklet called "What Has Worked in Investing" or something like that ... and it's quite nice.  You can get it for free on his company's website.   It is full of all the evidence that value investing works--lots of numbers, lots of tables.   Well, he has a chapter in the book called "Don't Take My Word for It", where he recycles that pamphlet--only taking out all the numbers and tables.   So we're left with a lot of text that rattles on with "blah blah blah" where a simple little half page table would have told the story in a way anyone could understand (again, see his free booklet which is well laid out and easy to read).  Get the free booklet on his company's website but if you want to learn about how to become a value investor, this book will not carry you far.  And if you already are an old time value investor, it's a yawn 
 I like reading.  I am a literature snob.  I put down poorly written novels (even though I can't write well myself!).  But, I think I've met my match in this novel.  I recognize the style is something unique, but I just couldn't grasp the rhythm.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those who gave this book thumbs down.  I really want to be in the group that appreciates this Plitzer Prize novel, but I don't make the cut.        HOwever, I'd love to read more from reviewers on what they saw in this book because I just couldn't find much other than the rambling thoughts of a very whiny and boring 40-something man whom I would't enjoy spending a 3-day-weekend with at all.        I've persistantly struggled through 180 pages, but now will surrender!   
 I was forced to read this book over my holiday break for my AP US History class. Normally, we would have had a test on it upon return, but my teacher went soft and just let us read it without punishment. I was expecting it to be horrible, as are most books about history. However, it was slightly better than I expected.   The lives of the characters really pulls you in, unlike most other crappy history books. This was the only thing that kept me from dying to death of bordeom. There were very long and dull sections where the author went straight into "history mode" and started explaining all the historical details of the time. This was when it got hard to read, and I often found myself skipping entire paragaphs out of sheer boredom.  Another thing was that the book had no central plot. It was basically just the struggle of the Slovak immigrants in America. There was really no substance to the story. I suppose it was written that way because that was how it was in real life. A foreign immigrant's life really had no plot or meaning, so I guess that's why the book didn't. The real meaning of the book only picked up in the last 40 pages or so, with the whole union struggle.   The thing that really angered/confused me was how the author freely switched around character's names. One minute, they were being referred to by their first name, and the next, everyone is calling them by their last name. Not to mention, sometimes between themselves, the Slovaks called each other by their Slovak names. This got very confusing, and made you wonder for a second... "Wait, who is that?" before you finally realized it was the same person as before, only under a different name.   Also, the amount of characters in this book was ridiculous. IT could be compared to The Lord of The Rings character-wise. Random names are just thrown out at you, some of which you are expected to remember for later on in the story, and others which are essentially meaningless.   Overall, the book wasn't too bad. It was better than your average historical novel, but still not something I would read voluntarily.  
 I love David Sedaris. I like Strangers with Candy. But this is the worst book I've ever read. All of the characters are exactly the same, and the entire book is a repetition of one joke. Save yourself valuable time and money and stay far, far away from Wigfield 
 I was actually looking forward to be using this unit since my DVD collection grew to over 600 DVDs and figured keeping most of them (or all of them in 2 changers, thank god I bought just one to see how it works) will make it easier to have my collection organized and ready to be played at the touch of a button. Although I was concerned about the lack of a RS 232 interface (the pricier 777ES model has it) which would have allowed me control from my HTPC I figured I was going to use an IR repeater to do this. A definite advantage of this unit over the 777 ES is the HDMI output which helps eliminate some of the cable clutter in the back of my AV stand. Unfortunately, the implementation of the unit leaves a lot to be desired as the following things are agravately annoying:  1. HDMI output is limited to a TV only (or projector) which makes no sense for any respectable setup where an AV receiver is a must. It seems that Sony forgot to include HDCP repeaters on their list of supported devices;  2. The unit does not work as advertised since althouhgh it has a feature to disable auto-play, it will stubbornly resume playing the last disc you were playing before shutting it down; for a single player that's fine, for a 400 changer this is downright stupid;  3. There is no way to access a disc by number other than going through the Explorer interface which is slow and a very bad designed UI; scrolling through 400 titles to find the one you want to play is not fun;  4. Most of the DVDs will not be recognized and forget inputting the information yourself 'cause for no good reason that info will dissappear in the near future;  5. Startup times and changing discs seems like forever and loading and unloading discs produces a noticeable across the room sound;  6. SACD output is analog only;  7. The unit is massive, understandable somehow, still will not fit most AV stands out there, sticking out of an open AV stand.  I am returning mine, this is not an acceptable solution for a changer.  You have been warned 
 Never even opened this book, because when it arrived I found that it is a Christian book, which would be fine if I were in fact Christian...  But I'm not.  Just wanted to warn others of the many other faiths in the world that if you are not Christian this book is not for you.  Wish I had read Zelda's review because a book that espouses anti-gay and anti-woman beliefs would not help my depression at all, and would in fact make me even more depressed that that kind of bigotry gets backed by a publisher.  Also, hearing that being born a woman makes me less than somehow doesn't make me feel overjoyed.   Glad I bought this used and very cheap.  Had to give it away.  
 What a disappointment!  I requested this book for Christmas, but after about 125 pages I pitched it.  In addition to bad writing, it became clear the author had a political agenda in writing it.  Not that injecting personal points of view is inappropriate; T.H. White does it brilliantly in his Once and Future King and Book of Merlin. It's just that the worldview Jack Whyte advocates is adolescent, ignorant and simplistic.  I won't know how Whyte will treat the complex mythopoeic stories of Merlin and Arthur; I hope with a lot more depth and nuance than he began his series 
 I hope people don't start to think of this movie as Alien 5.  In my mind this is a whole new venture, one that is separate from any of the work that Sigourney Weaver did on the first four Alien films.  The first 4 films are pretty good and I really like the whole series.  It works rather well and I would love to see another Alien film with Sigourney in it.  I think they could pull off one more film.  Ripley's a great hero.  This movie was pretty bad.  The only reason I give it 2 stars is because of the special effects.  I felt like I was watching a Scooby Doo version of Alien.  Whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted to make money.  The plot was..well..stupid and the atmosphere of the movie was pretty much non-existent.  Each of the first four Alien movies were provocative in some sense no doubt because of Sigourney's involvement.  This one was as boring as a white wall and it was as cheesy as a funhouse at a state fair. 
 This book isn't witty, funny, amusing or enlightening. It's sick and sad. Don't buy it. 
 This book has some interesting stuff in it but the style is terrible. There are loads of unbelievably bad metaphors and plenty of trashy sensationalism. Still, if you want to find out about a bit more about one  of the greatest bands around then give it a try 
 I can't comment as to the author's accuracy with regard to the magical characteristics of animals, but I will say that Ms. Conway needs to go back to high school and take introductory biology.  Much of the information that she presents with regard to the biological and behavioral attributes of several animals is simply false.  How exactly is one to commune with animals when one is so astoundingly ignorant as to their nature?  Why is it that all of these fluffy-New-Age-white-light witches think that they're also zoologists 
 I bought this book hoping to get some helpful tips on how to crate-trained my chihuahua, but instead of "HOW TO", there're tons of common-sense type information like "why it's important to crate-train...."! In addition, I'm very disappointed with the printing quality.  It's acuatlly not a book, but booklet!! 
 So whose brilliant idea was it substitute Jean Reno's trademark french accent with a bloody yank's?  What a total let down, the entire appeal of this bloke is his gruff, natural french accent and to trade it off with a yankie accent is beyond comprehension. Idiots.  Ray Duncan Australia. 
 This book would be great to those marketing financial services.  Example after example is spent determining how to market securities and finding out about how to find them.  Unfortunately, if you are in any other line of business, there will be precious little for you to take away with this book.  It was a waste of my money, but again, if you are selling financial products go for it.  Mar 
 Never got to wear this Lingerie at all.  Mailed item back for exchange due to a wrong size recieved but no one got back. Sent several emails to check on item for exchange but in the end got a reply saying that they will credit the amount back to my credit card.  Sent another email to emphasise that I requested for an exchange instead of refund but no one got back...  Very Very bad servic 
 This is an interesting history.  But it has the same problem common to all books such as this.  Once a name (person) is introduced in the book the reader is expected to remember the name and the relationship of that person to the "hero."  There needs to be a chart or reference to which the reader could easily refer to refresh one's memory when finding the name again, but many pages away from the first encounter 
 Based on my back-of-the-envelope calculations, this has 37 more short films about Glenn Gould than I'm willing to watch 
 I am an American studying abroad in Buenos Aires and I wanted to advise anyone who is considering buying this book to save their money. I had been using the Time Out guide in the city, which is infinitely better, but I brought this guide on a trip to Colonia and Montevideo because it had much more information. As it turned out, nothing the guide recommended for Montevideo was true or even open. It listed two vegetarian restaurants, one with three locations throughout the city. I spent the better part of a day walking around the city only to find that not a single one of those four was still in existence. I then found a Lebanese restaurant in the guide and walked there, only to find that it wasn't open either. I thought maybe some shopping would improve my mood... but few of the places listed still exist. We couldn't find the reccomended Baar Fun Fun or the Cafe Brasilero. At this point, I tossed the guidebook in the nearest trashcan. At least for Buenos Aires and Uruguay, its much wiser to stick with time out 
 the offspring..a band who draws inspiration from some of the best music around(the damned, TSOL, agent orange, adolescents, and DI), have great record label that is responsible for new records/re-issues from TSOL, The Damned, and other great legendary punk artists, and a band who used to be really great punk revival have truly disappointed me with records like this.  i fell in love with the offspring when i bought smash..after that, i proceeded to collect ignition and ixnay.and still, i loved them..but i was iffy on this..i mean i knew of songs like pretty fly and why dont you get a job and how bad they were, but songs like kids arent alright made me a buyer...i must say, i was rather impressed with this and decided that i underrated it...that was 3 years ago.  now, i think this album is just okay..i mean its good enough to be able to warrant a stay on my windows media player on my laptop, but as for keeping the disc, it isnt.  i say get this..get it cheap..rip it to your comp and then sell off. it gets old fast 
 Does D.S. know any other law schools besides, Harvard and Yale for her characters to have attended. I am so tired of her books...this is it for me.  Its the usual suspects for her...rich and white....quite boring.  I used to love her and would read anything from her, but those days are over.....Maybe she should retire 
 Was this book written for elementary reading?  At least that's what i thought when i was reading.  Better luck next time 
 I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't.  The setting and the culture is very exotic but the story itself is very weak and uninteresting.  The characters are all one-dimensional and their motivations are not explored; it is hard to care about them or to feel that you are really a part of their world.  The plot moves very, very slowly and it is easy to get bogged down and bored in the endless narration.  The Arabic names are pretty but are hard to keep straight, especially when very few characters have any defining attributes that will help a reader remember them.  I can't recommend it 
 Hey folks, this is brilliant and all, like the articles say, but what they don't mention is that it's impossible to listen to. There are no verses, choruses, or even beats to speak of. There are no songs. It's just a sound collage or something, from start to finish. The booklet prints lyrics but I couldn't find 'em. This music is too brilliant for its own good. And you can forget about using it as party or background music. JDub's other offerings are much better 
 An abundance of full-color plates and numerous black-and-white photographs made this book worth the modest price.  The text is awkward. It sounds as if English is not the author's first language and certain elements of carelessness in the writing suggest that the author was more concerned with the manuscript deadline than scholarship. Picasso's own words, appearing as blocked quotes in the margins are not dated, nor sources given. The reader is not able to chronologically trace the change in philosophy reflected in his words. The text also suffers from an inordinate number of typographical errors. Walther's poorly disguised gut reaction of disgust in describing some of Picasso's work may reflect the reaction his early critics felt in viewing some of his paintings. Walther uses words such as "horror," "grotesque," "misshapen," and "ugly," at one point writing, "Picasso wanted to destroy absolutely everything.&quot 
 The debate over the importance of participatory democracy is interesting, but does it really need to be debated in a 200+ page book?   Sometimes Polletta provides some interesting history on various social movements tried to be collectivist, but most of her book is generalized, esoteric rambling. Somehow some sociologist with graduate degrees feel entitled to write long boring, theoretical pieces like this. This book offers no new insight and will be forgotten. Jo Freeman wrote a short article (about 20 pages) on the same subject and it was much better than this. 
 If I were editing the book I would have told the author I want it to look like this: 10 pages on the idea of the weather channel and how it got to cable, 5 page pictoral of hot weather channel chicks, 12 pages on big storms the network has covered, 2 pages on how much of a weeny Paul Goodloe is and 230 pages on Jim Cantore. Folks, Jim Cantore IS the weather channel. He is on the edge of your seat entertainment that dares weather to take him on. Whether he is chasing after ann F-5 tornado with a paddle to stop it, surfing the waves of a cat 5 hurricane or reporting from a blizzard in a speedo, Cantore takes the worst mother nature has to offer and laughs at it. Yes, there are some other strong anchors at TWC like Sharon Resultan, Dr. Paul Kocin and Dr. Steve Lyons, but they are cluttered up by goofs like Goodloe and Bob Stokes. Stephanie Abrams is pretty hot. Cantore needs to pull a Sting and just leave the weather channel. If there were a cable channel just called Cantore that featured Jim going to places with the most horrible weather in the world, I would watch 24/7. I do realize Cantore can't do 24 hours worth of shows, but he would have to give his approval for any show on the network. If it gets Cantore approval, it's must see TV. This book missed out on a chance to tell the legend's story, but it does mention him so it's a good read 
 I don't own this model (super taper II), but another one I bought from Sears.  The one I have is JUNK: (1)  very heavy (2)  super noisy and vibrate like hell (3)  jam very easily, have to clean all the time DURING hair cut  I stay away from this manufacturer !!!  
 The latch broke when I opened the box.  The dividers are cardboard and are not secure.  However, customer service was great 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.  It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.  The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
 terrible book, it was honeslty such a waste of time, this author is obviously too set on his way of seeing things, very narrow mindedly, i do not suggest you wasting your time on this unless you enjoy right-winging torture, but that's just my opinio 
 With a full charge it does not last more than 10min, could not take more than more 15 pics in my camera Canon Pro1. The original battery works well more than 250 pics on each charge. Initially I thought this problem was because it was new battery but after several cycles it does not work at all. I'll try to get a refund and check their customer service too 
 Okay ... it's late, and I'm crabby after wrestling with a wireless network for most of the day.  I bought this bad boy to strengthen the signal for my network. A few really insanity-making points...  FIRST, as several other reviewers have pointed out, apparently you can hook this thing up to your router. Not that the directions tell you that, though. The directions only show connecting to a free-standing PC. (How silly of me to think I could follow the directions.)  I popped over to my local MicroCenter and bought a Linksys PCI card and this HSB2. (I'll usually try and stay with the same brand but MicroCenter had neither a Linksys signal booster or a Hawking PCI Adapter ... if indeed either company makes such a beastie.)  I got home from the store, slapped the Linksys PCI Adapter in, fired up the computer and went to connect the HSB2. Things were going too smoothly. As soon as I unscrewed the antenna from the PCI Adapter the signal disappeared (which is to be expected). I then connected the HSB2 ... and still nothing. Rebooted. Still nothing.   Checked Hawking's website. No user forums ... no nothing.  Checked amazon, thinking that I might get some good tech advice. The reviews say you can put it on the router (what a concept!). I unscrew the antenna on the router (a Linksys WRT54GS) only to discover ... that the HSB2 connector doesn't fit. Argh.  I call the tech support # from the back of the manual. Wrong #. Search the web, find the right #. I call and after a fairly short wait (a pleasant surprise!) I get a guy from India (no surprise there). I can usually understand these guys, but the connection was horrific ... had to start phonetically spelling everything like a WWII fighter pilot ("Kilo ... Bravo ... Whiskey ... Foxtrot...").  Anyway, the tech support guy right away starts talking me through the ROUTER end of things. I told him that I was following the directions (I'm goofy that way) and trying to connect to a PCI card. After a short stint on hold, Mr. Tekkie informs me that the HSB2 is incompatible with the Linksys PCI Adapter (this despite the HSB2 package that says, "Also works with other certified wireless network adapters and devices with removable antennas.") Except that it doesn't.  So.....  Mr. Tekkie THEN suggests I try to hook up the HSB2 to the ROUTER end of things, at which point I inform him that the connectors are incompatible. Another short moment on hold, and he comes back and tells me that I need a HACST coupler to connect the HSB2 to the Linksys Router. "Will the HSB2 be compatible with the router even though it's not compatible with the PCI adapter?" I ask. Tekkie assures me that it will be.  Amazon lists a HACST coupler at about $9.00 USD....can't wait to see what my local MicroCenter hammers me for it. (For installing my network I at least had the wisdom to buy locally so I could return things easier. When I go and pick up the HACST, it'll be trip #4 for the network....)  I might return the HSB2 or I might pick up the HACST ... I'm too tired to decide right now.  Whichever I decide (and I'll update the saga as it unfolds), this HSB2 is getting one star ... for compatibility issues and inexcusable documentation and a user unfriendly website.  Stay tuned!   UPDATE: See my comment that follows this review for an update 
 Was expecting a book that really helps fairly new readers to the concepts of financial engineering. This book is not well written and throws the reader into a lot of topics without any real-world, practical examples. A much, much, much, better book is Investment Science by Luenberger. Get that book. It kicks Hull's ass 
 I really love the first Nightmare on Elm street movie. the rest of the series are just absurd and borderline ridiculous. I thought this movie would be better since Wes Craven was directing/writing it. In my opinion it's everything but scary.The concept of this evil entitity trapped in stories for eons is interesting, however not very well explored in my opinion.The scenes remind us of the first Nightmare on Elm Street, a bit cool when it comes to nostalgia but they completely have no surprise effect whatever. It was nice to see some people of the original movie, like John Saxon and Nick Corrie. Yet they have such small roles which undermines their presence in the movie.Corrie doesn't even have a line. The "scary" scenes are actually hilarious at some points. This movie could have been better in my opinion.. 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 Pipi Longstocking  Pippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren is an inspiring tale about a girl named Pipi. She has a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nelson. Next door are two very polite children named Tommy and Annika and they become friends. I like that I can relate to Annika in that she is always hesitant but after she gets started she doesn't want to stop Pipi's fother is a sea man and left her at the house with a	suitcase full of gold pieces. Pipi likes to go on adventures. One was when Pipi tricked two thieves into leaving her house with nothing This is just one example of the many heroic adventures in this exciting book. I like that it has a moral that is deep so you have fun reading it and you close the book with a smile 
 I didn't think this was that great.  I read this in one night and I was not impressed at all 
 This is a Vocal Selections book, not the Vocal Score (as is clear from the large photo of the cover) 
 Yet another album that suffers form the lack of understanding of the work  of Bach.  I have not heard any previous swiched on Bach, and if this is the  style of interpretation of the Music then I will certainly give them a  miss.  The mathematical precision of the work with the relationship between  tones is lost in many sections and the whole seems to have gained a  discordant note that is not appropriate to Bach and his craftings.  The  whole feeling of the music is the same as Walter/Wendy Carlos's previous  works 
 I think I would've liked the book better if the author had said that it was "based on actual events". It read too much like a novel. While I have no problem with an author using creative license at times, some of the dialogue was too far fetched. I also found it impossible that he would know what the characters (for lack of a better term) were thinking, especially the target. There were at least two inconsistencies that I found. Not good. Makes you doubt the veracity of this version of the story. As a novel this would've worked. 
 I have been a trainer for many years, and am currently working towards becoming a behaviorist - and I can tell you that Paul Owens offers nothing new to the world of dog training. This book is an average (at best) compilation of training techniques discovered and perfected by other (professional) dog trainers/behaviorists. I've read many, many books on dog training and behavior and this is one not worth purchasing. If you're looking for an interesting read to learn more about how dogs think and why they act the way they do - check out any of Stanley Coren's books (he has many). If you're looking for training techniques - take a class. Honestly, there is nothing better for a dog than to go to puppy classes (with a respectable and knowledgable trainer) where they can be properly socialized and trained. If your dog is having serious behavior issues - consult a professional animal behaviorist. Your veterinarian should be able to refer you to somebody. Good luck! 
 I was looking for a series of charts that would combine people and historical dates.  For example, in Daniel, how do the various prophets line up with the various rulers?  When do Daniel's dreams take place chronologically?  This book didn't come close.  This book has outlines of each of the books.  I can get that in almost any commentary.  This book gave cursory discriptions and discussion about each Bible book.  But, the authors did not provide enough detail to make the reading worthwhile.  That level of detail made reading a waste of time.  This book is supposed to be a "Complete Book of Bible Charts and Maps!"  It's NOT.  Even the drawings of things like to ark of the covenant are small, roughly drawn and basically unuseable.  I was VERY disappointed with this book 
 As a new user of this or ANY such program, I find that this book does not cover the basics.  It was used in courses that I took to learn desktop publishing because of job requirements.  It's pretty much monkey see, monkey do if you have no experience with this program.  You don't learn the reasons why you're following the steps or how to decide which procedures apply when you're working on your own vice working with the lessons provided.  I'm looking for a book that gives you a foundation for thinking things through, and this is definitely not it 
 This movie was a big dissapointment. Lame acting, lame script and 70's chicks with bad acting skills. Not a very good "Women In Prison" film....there are better one like "Reform School Girls"....the band Caged Heat is way better than the movie...pass it up and get a life 
 Unreal. Short term fasts are more realistic. Unless you're loaded with money and time to take 10+ days of vacation, you can't realistically do this, not in a job that deals with the public. Still, it's all talk, common sense -stop shoveling food in your face and get off your couch and exercise. There's no scientific data, no detailed info on how to fast effectively. The chapters are terribly repetitive and end in a promotion for juice machines. I am returning this book for a refund or exchange. I find nothing worth revisiting in this book 
  Do dogs understand language?  Do they have their own syntax and grammar?  Stanley Coren thinks so.  Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people's interest and sell more copies...  The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant.  Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs.  When the door closes I'll say, "What do we do on an elevator?" and they'll all sit.  This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, "Look!  They understand every word you say!"    Not really.  I trained the dogs to do this by first saying "What do we do on an elevator?-we sit."  Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from "What do we do on an elevator?" to "Sit" quite easily.  In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all.  So it isn't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it's my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.    Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him.  Why?  Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog "understands" his words.  Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language.  But looked at objectively it's far more likely that the dog's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process.   Coren would still disagree.  He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there's a kind of syntax or grammar at work.  I'm sorry, Stan, but real language doesn't operate on such a simplistic level.  And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.    Look, it's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren't (which isn't always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state.  In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can't be.  It's not grammar or syntax, it's emotion, pure and simple.    Even if Coren hadn't thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he'd know that a dog's brain has no Broca's area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible.  But as with other books he's written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn't seem to care much about the truth.    Still, I have to admit that it's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc.  As a result we're almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists.    I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question.  And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, "Do you love me?" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose.  Does he understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him?  Of course not.  But I know he understands the emotion.  It's a shame that Coren doesn't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language.    If I could I'd give this book no stars at all 
 Boritt's 'Gettysburg Gospel' is one of the very few Civil War books that I could not get into.  Stylistically, this book is way too haphazard and unorganized to be considered one of the best books in the Lincoln cannon.  Boritt falls into the trap that Garry Wills fell into in his "Lincoln at Gettysburg."  The two authors try to be over-elegant and verbose because their book itself is about one of the greatest triumphs of the English language rather then a singular event.  Boritt (and Wills for that matter) would be better to just write in a plain, inelegant fashion without the grossly excessive verbiage which permeates this book.  Wills, in all fairness, can get away with it, but the more academic Boritt has a difficult time indeed.  For example, Boritt writes early on in describing the dead on the battlefield: "Others even pulled bodies from shallow graves.  A weapon is worth a great deal.  Who cares who the dead man was?  Who was it?  Dead."  This kind of useless prose brings the momentum of this book down time and time again.  For Civil War enthusiasts themselves, many already knew that Everett went on for a very long time before Lincoln delivered his address.  One of the things that surprised me was the lack of analysis of the address itself.  That disappointed me because the book was subtitled as: `The Lincoln Speech Nobody Knows."    In order to get a fresh analysis that Wills does not offer in his book, the reader will have to turn to the appendix to get the several versions of the address.  Overall, more focus and less sentimentality would have made for a leaner, more coherent account of the making of the address and it's meaning through the last 140 years.   
 One of the reviewers below stated that admirers of Hurston "won't be disappointed" by this book. I beg to differ: I've read pretty much everything Hurston has written, and I think she is without a doubt one of the best American (and perhaps world) writers of the twentieth century. But "Seraph" was a great disappointment. Hurston simply overreached with this one. By the time I had finished reading it, I found myself wondering what the point of this book was. The story follows the marriage of a Florida couple over several decades. The husband is ambitious and forceful, yet also arrogant and sometimes violent, while the wife is timid and (overly) sensitive. Told from the wife's point of view, the problem with the story is that it essentially goes from a more or less realistic give-and-take between the two to an account of how she tries to prove herself worthy of her husband (there is little in the way of growth on his part by the way, e.g. he never expresses any regret for having acted like a brute during the early years of their marriage). Thus, "Seraph on the Suwanee" basically reads like a romance novel. It's true that anthropologist Hurston provides some interesting details into the lives of the "Florida crackers" (i.e. poor southern whites) in the early 20th century, but this is hardly enough to compensate for the novel's weaknesses. It's hard to believe that the literary genius who wrote "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (among other excellent books) could produce such a lackluster wor 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 I love Mollie Katzen's earliest cookbooks - Moosewood and Enchanted Broccoli Forest. Dishes I make from those are relatively easy and very tasty. I have tried a lot of recipes in this cookbook and I have been very disappointed. They just...don't taste as good. I have served some dishes from this cookbook which have remained uneaten on the table. On the other hand, when I use the other two, people usually enjoy the food, and ask me for the recipes. I have learned my lesson, and I don't use it anymore. If you actually want to buy a cookbook which is a useful source of recipes, I do not recommend this one 
 For me, this encyclopedia has a  misleading title in that most of the entries deal with vampires or vampire-like creatures. There is some material on werewolves & other shapeshifters and skinwalkers, but I found myself wondering where those 'Other Monsters' were. The author dedicated several pages to the 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' television series and the author Anne Rice while only giving a nod to classics such as 'Carmilla' and not even a mention of the 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' - and the only mention of Dr. Frankenstein or his monster is an entry for 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman'. There are also entries for Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley - people who may have been involved in the occult but who were hardly monsters. Noticeably absent, especially in the presence of vampire and monster -portraying actors, is Vincent Price. Overall, I can only recommend this book in good conscience if you're a vampire fan. Otherwise, it will only disappoint 
 INVOLVEMENT AFTER 11 NOVEMBER 1975 After independence, Cuban forces and an unlimited number of Russian armamaents streamed into Angola and completely took over the military function from MPLA. FOXBAT, strengthened by ZULU, had to contend with heavy 122mm fire on 13 November 1975, after which this battle group also requested artillery from the RSA. While the build-up of Cuban forces took place mainly in the Quibala area, the South African supported Unita and FNLA concentrated on the retention of their traditional areas of influence. Action in which these forces were concerned took place mainly in no-man's land between Quibala and Santa Comba. The need to hold the territory resulted in an escalation of South African involvement and the creation of additional battle groups to such an extent that the South African involvement just before withdrawal stood at just under 2000 men (logistics element included). As a counter- move to the Cuban build-up and especially to the 122mm rocket launchers, 140mm guns were brought into the struggle. This caused chaos among the Cuban ranks. The following events are exceptional:   Bridge 14 To deny the Cuban forces access to the anti-communist line of defence, the Battle of Bridge 14 took place on 9 December 1975 in the Catofe area. During this battle, the battle group FOXBAT dealt the Cubans a shattering blow. FOXBAT comprised 3 FNLA/Unita companies, a company of South African infantry and an armoured car squadron, supported by eight 140mm and four 38mm guns, a platoon of mortars and an engineer element, all South Africans. The Cuban/MPLA force consisted of a battalion of Cubans, an MPLA battalion and a mixed supporting battalion with 122mm rocket launchers, artillery and mortar support. The battle raged from 9 December 1975 to 12 December 1975 and yielded the following results:  i. 200 Cubans dead  ii. 200 MPLA dead  iii.10 x 76mm guns seized  iv. 22 x 122mm mortars seized  v. 4 x 122mm rocket launchers destroyed  vi. 1 x 122mm rocket launcher seized  vii. 4 South Africans dead    Occupation of the Salazar Bridge A newly appointed battle group, known as ORANGE, comprising a Unita battalion, an armoured car squadron, a company of South African infantry and artillery occupied the Salazar Bridge over the Cuanza River, north of Mussende, the northern border of the Unita area, on 12 December 1975.  Apparently the South Africans lost air superiority. Below are records of South African/Cuban air engagements. On 6 November 1981 then-Major Johan Rankin of the South African Air Force (SAAF) shot down a MiG-21MF (the SAAF identified it as a "MiG-21Bis"), flown by Teniente Danacio Valdes, over Angola with 30mm gunfire while flying a Mirage F-1CZ. It was the SAAF's first victory in air-to-air combat since Korea. Almost a year later on 5 October 1982, the second aerial combat of the war took place. The duo formed by Tenientes Raciel Marrero Rodriguez and Gilberto Ortiz Perez, clashed with a couple of Mirage F1s, again under the leadership of Johan Rankin; Marrero's MiG-21 was lightly damaged by the 30mm gunfire. The MiGs broke contact and returned to their base in Lubango, without encountering any further problems. The South Africans however, declared that Rankin had shot down one of the MiG-21s and that the other had crashed after being damaged, two supposed MiG loses that never took place. The only recorded aerial victory for the Cuban MiG-21s occurred on 3 April 1986 when a pair of MiG-21MFs intercepted two C-130s reportedly carrying cargo to UNITA. They shot down one and the other escaped seriously damaged. According to South Africa (and the International Air Transport Association) they actually shot down a civilian C-130 registered to the Angolan government airline.  The best-documented loss of a Cuban-flown MiG-21 over Angola was on 28 October 1987 when an armed two-seater MiG-21UM was downed by ground fire near Luvuei. The two crewmembers successfully ejected and were captured by UNITA 
 The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.   As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).   Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.   The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.   James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end. 
 I found this book to be more high tech than possible for the average reader to understand.  It was not helpful at all 
 I bow to my colleagues who have observed Manchester's acquired taste for the MacArthurian mystique and the apparent failures of historians (not just Willam M.) on getting it right regarding The General's ego and its fallout in combat. Yes this stuff is significant, but all this overlooks one outstanding reality, that Manchester includes but does give the proper emphasis: Doug MacArthur wanted to be president, very, very badly.  He truly saw himself as a caesar-like figure in history and positioned himself in returning to the Philipines, administering post-war Japan, and taking the baton in Korea (at the age of 70) for a return to the US in "triumph."  Instead he bowed out after being fired by Truman, who had nothing to lose by relieving him. This book is an enormous achievement, necessary for a student of modern history, but Manchester misses a golden opportunity to build a dramatic effect when giving the account of the final years of MacArthur's public life by passing over these events and not leaning on their true meaning 
 Many years ago - more than I'd care to remember, truth be told - I was spellbound by the first two books in this trilogy (Wideacre and The Favored Child, respectively). At the time, I searched high and low, but could not find, the concluding chapter of the series. I went on to read and fall in love with another book by the same author - The Wise Woman - but my search for Meridon proved elusive.  Until recently, that is.  With the reprinting of the trilogy, I anxiously rushed out and picked up Meridon, worried that I might have difficulty picking up the saga, as my memory is... well, not good, to say the least.   Without hesitation, I dove into Meridon... and quickly found myself mired in a story which had it's interesting moments, but spent far too long on the road with circus folks and not nearly enough time at the beloved estate around which the previous two books had centered.   Anyone wondering how this book would fare as a stand-alone read, were it to be picked up without having read Wideacre and The Favored Child, need not fear. I believe it works perfectly well on its own. I doubt, however, that anyone reading the conclusion of the saga would feel compelled to rush out and purchase the first two books. Which is sad, considering how excited I was to get to the third book based on what had come before.   None of this is to say that the book is not worth reading, especially for those looking for a sense of closure to the series. However, compared to the author's previous work in the series, this book can only be considered something of a let-down. 
 Wesley J. Smith presents palliative care as the be-all and end-all solution to terminal and chronic pain.  However, he doesn't address the facts and statistics.  Countries with legalized euthanasia, such as The Netherlands, have exemplary levels of palliative care that transcend what is offered in the United States.  The example of Oregon, the sole state where assisted suicide is allowed, has shown a marked increase in the level of pain relief for the sick and elderly.  Tragically, Smith's opposition to euthanasia leads to more pain and suffering for the terminally ill, which in turn leads to more support for euthanasia.  Palliative care is far from perfect today, and it is unlikely to alleviate all pain for all patients.  Most practice euthanasia 'under the radar', by calling it 'terminal sedation' by sedating the patient into a coma for weeks until they die.  Frequently, they'll awaken several times in excrutiating pain.  Not surprisingly, they'll do this without consulting the patient, so Smith's ideology removes more autonomy.  Thusly, the patient is either condemned to a death with insufficient pain relief, or a prolonged comatose state without any choices at all.  Then there's the case of Terri Schiavo.  Wesley J. Smith also opposes the removal of patients from life support.  This is nonsensical - Terri's wishes were well-known among her husband and many friends.  If we let doctors decide what treatment is 'best' for the patient, people will lose trust in the medical profession.  Surely the one on the receiving end of painful and often futile treatment should be allowed some say in whether they undergo and/or continue some treatment.  Indeed, I would say that their wishes should trump those of their doctors.  Surely we do not want cancer sufferers to ignore their symptoms and avoid doctors out of fear.  In addition to this, many resources and a great deal of manpower was wasted keeping Terri alive for years after no improvement was reached and Michael, her legal guardian, decided to remove her from life support.  Many lives could be saved and improved if nurses did not spend years taking care of a vegetable that could not respond, had no conscious mind and no hope of recovery, as the autopsy proved.  In the end, we all own our own lives.  Smith would like to choose to live for himself.  What he doesn't have the right to do is to make that choice for all of us and demand that we live on his terms 
 I'm in the military,  It hard for me to purchase items especially stationed overseas.  It's always been easy to order from Amazon as always, I never had any problems.  the earrings were beautiful but the post was very hard to remove from the earrings, when i pulled to remove the post while in my ear, the post broke off from the ball earring.  I only had them for two weeks 
 I read so much about her down to earth humor and wit that I picked her up. You have to be really right wing, and realy christian to truly enjoy her book. And if you are, you will enjoy her breezy depictions of her marriage, identify with her horror at discovering her son has succumbed to the `homosexual lifestyle' (as the blurb puts it.) and egg her on all the way, upbeat despite all her travails. If you are slightly more iiberal, you will question the very basis of this book, think her humor extremely offensive (he cannot be gay, he is a christian) and believe there are many people who have lead much more difficult lives than her, who do not try and make a book out of it. 
 That's basically my two cents. Shallow characters, bizarre story. I am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films, but I do like a good story and heard this was one. It was not. All of the characters were inverted - Ada and her daughter were utterly irritating, George was disgusting from start to finish, and Sam Neill's character (supposedly the heartless jerk) was actually the easiest to sympathize with. How frustrating!  On a positive note, Michael Nyman's score is unbelievable. I love it 
 FOREIGNER IS THE WORST OF THE WORST.THEY ARE EVEN MORE WORSE THAN GREEN DAY.EACH AND EVERY SONG AND ALBUM OF THEIR SUCKS.WAITING FOR A GIRL LIKE YOU IS THE MOST IDIOTIC SONG I HAVE EVER HEARD.DONT LISTEN TO THE REVIEWER BELOW ME WHO IS AN ALIAS OF WHIRLIGIG FROM BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA.BUY ANY CD FROM ICONS LIKE LED ZEPPELIN,PINK FLOYD,THE ROLLING STONES,QUEEN AND AC/DC INSTEAD. 
 I love the Backyardigans but this book is not worth purchasing.  The pull tab system they use is very difficult and hard for children to do themselves.  The pull tabs are supposed to be pulled to two seperate settings but they get jammed easily (especially when pushing them back in).  Needless to say, my book was broken the first day I received it 
 I'm a thirteen year old cutter, yeah i admit it whatever. anyway i've taken to drinking too but for a teacher to let you off the hook because your a good student? gimme a break! teachers get fired and wouldn't cover for a student even if they did like them. I' ve never taken drugs but why were they the only ones doing it? I mean there are more potheads than just two per school. What i didn't like was how stoehr went about the cutting in her story. At one point she says " i could stop anytime i wanted to i just don't" or something like that. But cutting is just as bad as being addicted to pot you can't give it up easily. That's whats so bad about it. I've tried to stop so many times and i don't want professional help but see i try but i never completely get rid of it. That point in the book was what threw me off, That's what i didn't like about it. The book didn't seem like she had researched about what she was writting. I just didn't like it 
 The authors theorize that because primitive life apparently (based on scientific evidence) began early in the earth's history that it is likely universal (and may have bounced around from Mars to earth). Once they accept this as a given the rest of the book is about how many factors are uniquely involved to accomodate complex life.   This approach glosses over two critical issues.   (1) All life on earth is based on the genetic code right down to 'simple' (structurally)  viruses (from this point of view it is 'universal'; i.e. all life as we know it). The DNA and RNA processes of the genome are far too complex to arise spontaneously, whether here or from Mars. Modern science suggests that there must be a prebiotic evolution with a DNA precursor. The authors mention a number of theories including the popular "RNA World" theory where the RNA performed all of the necessary functions. However no one has successfully modeled this so it is only a hypothesis bordering on pure speculation. RNA specialist Gerald Joyce has gone so far as to say "The most reasonable assumption is that life did not start with RNA...The transition to an RNA world, like the origins of life in general, is fraught with uncertainty and is plagued by a lack of experimental data." The authors' distinction between 'simple' and 'complex' life from a scientific viewpoint is misguided. The critical first step or 'prebiotic phase' is so far unexplainable and applies to all life. As the authors of a recent unpublished paper (available on the web like many articles) state "The information crisis in prebiotic or chemical evolution stems essentially from two observations: (i) the length of a replicating polymer (i.e. RNA-like template) is limited by the replication accuracy per nucleotide, and (ii) templates that differ significantly from each other cannot coexist in a purely competitive setup. Realistic estimates of the error rate of primitive replication mechanisms predict too scanty information content per template - less than 100 nucleotides - to permit the complete codification of the mechanism in just one template."   (2) The earth clearly evolved over time from an original molten mass so one might well expect that as it cooled and water formed that more structurally complex life evolved with it (even if the prebiotic phase is universal). For those interested in the evolution they would be better educated by a book on Evolutionary Dynamics that does not, by a bunch of 'hand waving', spend time speculating about the qualitative effects of the moon on tides and Jupitor on asteroids. There is lots of science on the evolution of complexity and how it can work as opposed to not work.  This is not to deny that life in the universe maybe very rare, but this is apparent from our telescopes and the very complexity of the much misunderstood first prebiotic steps. However the inference that these first steps can be taken for granted is not science 
 Not the book to buy if you have any degree of admiration for the exploits of Captain Cook.  A ready Australian chippiness pervades this anthropological work that seems to present Cook, Banks et al. as insensitive British blunderers impinging disastrously upon the noble savages they meet upon their voyages.  An impressive knowledge of the cultures encountered on the voyages is offset by a surprising degree of ignorance about naval procedures coupled with jarring first person interventions and social speculation more appropriate to a Mills & Boon novelette.  Throughout, judgements (of which there are many) are presented from the perspective of a 21st century anthropologist.  Poor Cook he really should have more of a "New Labour" man - inclusiveness, social diversity, racial awareness should have been his watchwords.  But then, endowed with such sensitivity, would he have ever have left Ushant on his port bow 
 Ok,  I bought their 4 bag combo special which feature all their flavors back when their site was taking orders direct.  This jerky is not very good.  In fact, I threw away about half of it because some of the pieces where very thick and hard.  Kind of like eating leather and plastic mixed in together.  Trust me when people say this : there is MUCH BETTER jerky out there.  I even e-mailed the company and told them that I was very unsasfied with thier jerky.  They offered me a refund and I should of taken it, but I decided not to 
 Halperin's book highlights the absurdity of social constructionism.  If homosexuals first appeared in the English speaking world when the word was first attested in 1892, then they must by that logic have appeared in the German speaking world in 1869, when Kertbeny coined the German equivalent.  We homos also must have not yet appeared among speakers of such languages that do not yet have the term - even if some of those speakers know English.  This exaggerated form of social constructionism ignores the habitual, exclusive sodomite known to medieval and early modern Europeans, as well as to the Greeks and Romans whose authors often satirized such queens in terms all too familiar today.  Halperin should give up on history and theory and go to work studying cowboys, now that he has relocated from the Hub to Australia and then to the mid-west - not far from the Wild West.  His expertise seems to extend from Gilgamesh and Enkidu to the Lone Ranger and Tonto! 	John Addington Symonds, who was as familiar or more familiar than anyone else with German scholarship about inversion, must have known about the German neologism in 1869 long before 1892.  In Halperin's twisted, tainted logic did he therefore become a homo avant le mot anglais?  The same must also apply to gay if indeed "gay" in that sense was another neologism, as many claim. 
 The 2 stars is the average I give to all the fable books written by Patrick.   The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: 5 stars  Obviously, it is the best one. (you can see it from the sales record in Amazon). It was the first Patrick's book I read. I have finished reading the whole book in one setting and couldn't wait and jump to look for his other books. The book has a reasonable length, setting up a bit simplified, but not over-simplified, and still reasonable fable-like setting to illustrate all important team dysfunctions and team building skills. The whole book is tight and coherent and an easy but enlightening read. Highly recommended!    Death by Meeting: A Leadership Fable 4 stars  It is a good one but not as great as the five team dysfunctions. A very good explanation of all kinds of meetings and how to use each of them. I recommend you buy one, read it and keep it as a reference. One drawback is the author tried to spicy up the book so one of the main characters will occassionally scream out some rude comments if he didn't take his pills. I never work with such an unusual person and I prefer less dramatic in a management fable. (not something like in "Desperate Housewife", the neighbor besides you was a serial killer and the housewife across the street did her gardener and used her Chinese maid to bear her baby.)   I should have stopped here and never rush to read his other books..    The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive: 2 stars  This is the one made me begin to feel betrayed. If the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within weeks. The fable setting needs more polishing works. Although the four obsessions have been presented with reasonable clariy, reading this book makes you feel that the author thinks you are an idiot. Scenarios like how the VP HR plots to damage the trust seem to be more suitable for a toddler fable rather than something for teenagers, not mentioning for managers. The rough plot affects the whole four points--though four very good points. I will recommend you to skim the whole book in less than 20 minutes by standing in a bookstore.    Five temptations of CEO 1 star?  It is the one makes me begin to feel angry. Again, if the five dysfunctions have been crafted for months, this one seems to be done within hours. The major story (95% of the book) happened in a dark train, where a poor CEO was taught about these five temptations by some ghost-like old men, who turned out later to be the previous CEOs in the SAME company! Again the five temptations are all great and worthwhile points. It is the plot that made me sick. If you have a chance, skim the whole book in less than FIVE minutes.   Silos, Politics and Turf Wars NEGATIVE 1 star  The worst one. Negative 1 star is because it wasted my time. I thought the five temptation one was the worst until I read this one. Patrick spends most of the book to illustrate the silo problems rather than provide any solution. And he even spends many pages about the main character's struggle in balancing his work and his wife's pregnancy, which I believe, should belong to another fable about personal life balance, given how many pages the author devoted to this. From other fables, more or less, you can at least learn something. But not from this one. Forget it!  
 the author don't know how to express in simple and understandable language, although he know very well in this major. I have already read some other books of this major, it is still confusing me a lot to understand some sentences in this book 
 I HATE THE ROLLING STONES. THEY WERE ONE OF THE WORST BANDS IN HISTORY!! THIS IN MY OPINION IS THEIR ONLY GOOD ALBUM. THIS HAS SOME OF THE GREATEST SONGS FEATURING SHATTERED. GET THIS WITH ALBUMS FROM DIRE STRAITS, GNR, FOREIGNER, AND METALLICA BUT STAY FAR AWAY FROM THE A BIGGER BANG, BEGGARS BANQUET, STICKY FINGERS, AND EXILE ON MAIN STREET ALBUMS WHICH SUCK BIG PERIOD 
  Like the last guy said, Nothing Sacred is such a bad@$$ hard rock song it makes you wonder what these guys were thinking when they threw the rest of the album together. There's a few hard rock/metal attempts but they all suck and none of them are effective in the least, with the exception of Nothing Sacred..definitely one-hit wonder status for these guys 
 I wanted to like Jane Alison's "Love Artist".  I really wanted to see if she could bring new life into the story of Ovid.  Well, she didn't, and I was left feeling confused and a bit hallow.  In this tale, Ovid meets an unusual "sorceress" named Xenia, and they fall in love, and he brings her back from the Black Sea coast to his Rome, where "Metamorphosis" has just came out.  There, Ovid gains the patroonship of Augustus's only granddaughter, who dispises her grandfather so much she aborts a pregnancy, thus robbing him of heirs.  Anyway, parts of the book are quite erotic, but I don't quite understand how it ended badly for them.  Alison is too vague mostly, and this detracts from the story 
 I was pretty disappointed with the material that covered DNS.  This is major section of the exam, and this is what made me fail twice.  I barely failed both times, but the DNS questions were much more complex than what was covered in the book.    Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of experience with DNS because our org doesn't use Windows DNS, so I think that hurt me, too.  Someone with a couple of years experience with DNS might do fine, but try to get another source if you don't 
 Do what we did: buy this toy, watch as you and your child try to play with it (key word and first tip being "try") and only then visit Amazon and read the reviews.  Next time out, both you and your child will be smarter about taking the time to read the reviews FIRST.  Don't buy this 
 This is the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen. Firstly, this book is putatively "written" by a snotnose who some neo-con writer probably thought would serve as a great marketing schtick. I mean, are we expected to believe that this kid has anything insightful or informative to say about the American media?? C'mon, people, go read McLuhan or something.    Secondly, WHAT LIBERAL MEDIA? As far as I can tell, even the liberals in the media are afraid to "rock the boat." They're ineffectual nothings who haven't practiced truly investigative reporting in decades (except for Seymour Hersch... much props). They operate as a collective unit of nebbishes, but at least they are the conservative media. By the way, Fox News is the number one news channel on cable television, so don't tell me that liberals control the media. There're plenty of people who watch the conservative crap proposing to be news. Wow, the American populace is dumb. THINK, FOLKS, THINK!! (NB: Yes, I'm an angry, but mostly objective, liberal 
 We had a rude awaking today, our Delonghi toaster was on fire. I will never again buy any Delonghi product. The defective design is in the toast switch. It is mechanical. When it finishes toasting, it sometimes continues to the "Always On" position thus leaving the toaster oven on toast: very, very hot. We literally had a house full of smoke & a toaster full of flames. You were warned.  Funny thing is, Delonghi makes an attractive product. Sad thing is, they can cost you your house or worse 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 I bought and examined this book thoroughly. There are so many old concepts I wonder whether the author has ever re-read its current second edition. It is supposed to have been written for C++ programmers but of what generation? I understand that the current 2nd edition was written after the release of MS Visual C++ 4. So, the source code still assumes that C++ doesn't have the true and false Boolean constants since the author #defines them, which causes an error in both Visual C++ 6 and later. In fact, the use of #include <iostream.h> and void main()indicate that the book is not ANSI compliant. The web site that supports the book provides source code, for MSVC 4 (only after I bought the book, which is extremely expensive, did I find out on the 4th page that it was released in 1996; but the current C++ Standard is from 1998). I tried compiling them in MSVC6 and MSVC.NET. None of the programs compiled (none at all). Even after re-creating the programs by adding files manually, I received many many errors. I tried to fix them and also tried compiling from the Command Prompt, to no avail. It is true that we don't have that many books on compiler development but just as these books are rare, this particular one will be to no help. It is (very) old and its programs don't work. The only things you might get are the authors comments that may help you with some suggestions or guidance, which will be little 
 At first the show had some merit, because the character of Valerie was sympathetic. As things progressed, she became less likeable, and the show's writers seemed to get desperate. It was like a bad accident: hard to stop watching, but left a bad feeling 
 people need to get the message and realize that commercial rap is not benificial to hiphop culture. these songs are weak, don't purchase it unless you're buying for someone you hate.. 
 The Songlines is unfortunately two books in one and they do not really gel.  Each separately would of received more stars.  It starts quite well as a narrative of his time in Alice Springs and the aboriginal culture he explored.  This is very readable and quite educational (and would of scored 4 -5 stars).  Unfortunely at about halfway through books he starts putting in little quotes in sequence often for 20 - 30 pages which interupts the story line of the other 'book'.  He really should of pulled the quotes out and built them into a second novel.   In the end though the book became a struggle to read because it no longer flowe 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 This book is a pathetic attempt to copy Edith Wharton's beautiful novel "Ethan Frome." It does not have the power of Wharton's classic and does not hold the reader's interest. I thought that this book just  rambled on without a purpose until its conclusion. It should have never  been given the Pulitzer Prize 
 My titles sums it up. I expected a books that provides me with new insights - nothing like that. It's appeared to me as an analysis of what PR is (or better should), how the job chances, how working day looks like, and  so on. For everybody who looks for a practical approach - forget it. But I  can recommend the book because of its ton of references 
 I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?  I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.  Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.  2 Stars. 
 I tried to install the driver on my computer.   The computer went into a loop, just booting, shutting down, and rebooting. I was able to get the computer into safe mode and use system restore to revert to an earlier point.  I'm scared to try it again.  Any body want it? I'll sell it cheap. For that matter, just pay the postage and it's yours 
 Bob the Builder used to be this innocent kids show where our Bob Villa-esque hero fixed roofs and built barns for his neighbors, but in this new series Bob looks like he's been hanging out with Captain Planet a little too much.  The familiar "Yes we can!" motto takes a back seat to Bob's new warcry of "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," which is repeated no less than 50 times in the first episode.  The first episode, which includes a scene of a barefoot, tie-dye wearing Bob, centers around Bob killing a tax revenue-producing vacation development in favor of community (because "city" is a dirty word) built on reverence to the environment.  Bob and his crew of presumably low-emission construction machines are charged with building the community, and are joined by new character apparently inspired by Homer Simpsons' ill-fated "Poochy" personality (Hey kids... Recycle to the extreme!!)  And most of the familiar characters are voiced by different people: Bob, Lofty, Spud, and Mr. Bentley have all new voices.  All I can say is the pre-school set is a little young to be pushing a political agenda, and all this is a little much for someone older than the target audience to take. The one star is mostly for technical advances over previous Bob releases, and for keeping the kickin' Bob theme song.  Of course, my 3 year old loved it, and we'll probably get the next Project: Build It video when it's released in November 
 may god have mercy upon this poor excuse for a mans sou 
 One mindblowing, boring saturday night I decided to watch I Know What You Did Last Summer. Oh what a choice. So I sat there and watched and watched. The first maybe 25 minutes seemed quite entertaining. But as the plot began to unravel, it seemed more clear to me that it was just like any other Scary teen movie. Yes, some parts of it were suspensful. But the movie was very pointless. Some guy chasing after some rich ass teens after they killed a guy that wasn't even related to him? And what was up with the whole costume? It was very stupid and predictable. Bassicaly this movie is good if you have nothing else to do, than waste one hour and a half of your life. 
 I have come to the conclusion that Ken Burns  cannot make a documentary over 2 hours long.   He is repetitious and on a soap box throughout this documentary.  There are some wonderful moments, but the east coast bias and the social commentary get old very quick.  How many times, I groaned at the screen, "not again"...I get it Ken, I get it...show me some baseball already.  It is very apparent that this documentary was made to be watched over the course of 2 1/2 months...it is unwatchable back to back.  Pick any one disk and it is very enjoyable, but then put it away for a while before you watch another one.  dissapointing 
 I enjoy food but most of the recipes in this book are things I wouldn't eat in the first place 
 [Wince.] Noticing that Reilly had been an international bestseller, I bought these audio CDs for a road trip and subsequently found myself embarrassed as I listened to a book that seemed to borrow all its plotlines from G.I. Joe cartoons. Listening to the audio version, I was amazed at Reilly's nerve in magically saving his hero time and again. Reilly even pummels the reader with the same language in the sentences preceding the countless near misses. The hero is about to be squashed, when just at the last second -- his friend uses a magnet to suck him back out of the way. The hero disappears off the cliff, when just before he hits the ground -- he manages to activate a parachute. The hero is about to be decapitated, when just at the last moment -- his friend comes back from the dead to shoot the brains out of his foe.     While Reilly no doubt did research to write this book, the flatness of his characters uncovers him as a grownup child still obsessed with battle action cartoons, good vs. evil comic books, action figures, and wham! pow! action scenes, but who never learned to relate emotionally on an adult level. The author himself writes in a book interview that it devastated him to have to cut off the life of his hero's girlfriend, an undeveloped character that's about as flat as my niece's stick figure drawings. As I listened to him talk about it, I felt sorry -- not for his character but for myself. After all, if he had wanted the reader to care, even a little, he could have taken the time to create just one conversation between the hero and his girlfriend 
 why should anyone else???  Her own daughter says it is filled with inacurracies and indeed, the author makes it a point in every page to make himself the ONLY friend Lucy ever had.  As Lucie Arnaz herself said, "skip this one".  
 Not a book for beginners, since it is extremely confusing and poorly organized. You have to deeply study the book in order to get any benefit as opposed to reading it. The presentation and the drawings are all jumbled up and hard to follow. NOT WORTH I 
 I'm a fan of the line, I love the chocolate, but this vanilla was too fake tasting and too strong tasting.  Vanilla should be subtle, this was more like taking a shot of extract. 
 I haven't read this book, but I have read the reviews.  This is not the M. Scott Peck of the The Road Less Travelled.  I just finished reading M. Scott Peck's "Glimpses of the Devil" in which he made reference to his first wife, Lily, as if they were still married so I am assuming that he is still married.  If you enjoyed the Road Less Travelled and found it to be a challenging and helpful book, this is NOT the same author and you will very likely be disappointed 
    I have nothing really against Jordan Rubin and this book. What it offers is common sense natural medicine. Nothing in this book is really a revelation or surprising. Most or if not all of the information can be found in other publications as is really nothing more than a compilation of other resources. The big issue here is Mr. Rubin's claims and other peoples claims of being "cured" or "healed" by chronic diseases. This is simply wrong, incorrect, inaccurate, and ignorant to say. Sure Mr. Rubin wants you to use his Garden Of Life products. They aren't cheap either. But to say that you will be "healed" or "cured"? These "products" just suppress the symptoms, which is great! But that should not make you stray away from seeing a medical doctor. Just because you used to have a diesase say like Diabetes does not mean it was cured. Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn Disease are the same way. They are always there. If people actually think that these diseases can be cured by Garden Of Life products they are gullible, sad, lost people. Using this system in conjunction with a doctor is the best way. I know some people despise doctors and are willing to shell out a lot of money for Garden Of Life products INSTEAD of seeing a doctor and that is just plain stupid. Wake up people. 
 I have yet to receive anything to indicate that i have purchased a 4year service plan. I am still awaiting this information. I should have been sent w/my product or before my product has arrived.  I am not Satisfied because i have not received anything at all about my service plan. When you send me something i will be happy  Ms. Budho 
 I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life.  I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined. 
 I wrote a negative review of this book.  A 1-star review.  It was removed.  It was my opinion that this book is not so great.  Whenever the author couldn't explain something he easily dismissed it.  Basically, religion is made by man for man.  Religion is believing in what someone else is telling you to believe.  When someone in the modern world claims to speak with God, everyone thinks he/she is crazy, yet millions are so willing and gullible to believe it really happened in the distant past when man was more primitive and easily confused natural events for those of the supernatural.  I finished this book with a very empty feeling.    
 I haven't received it yet and have been trying to email Amazon with no luck, It was sent on 3rd Dec to Australia They promised to deliver by the 22 Dec if I bought before 4th Dec so I don't think I will ever buy a book from Amazon again. No book no revie 
 Even though this book is inexpensive, I was very disappointed.  Most of the moves are not true submissions.  The neck cranks and chokes that are shown don't seem like they would work even on the untrained.  The straight and bent armlock are covered, but nothing you haven't seen before.  Bottom line: this book is cheap, but it will just take up space and collect dust in your apartment 
 Is Edell anything more or less than a 19th century huckster peddling the latest fads cloaked in the jargon of medical science?  A resounding NO!  Only this time around he is not making the rounds in a horse and buggy but on America's airwaves.  His "bag" consists of criticizing  others' opinions that do not fit into his laissez faire worldview:  sex is good, eat drink and be merry is good, and your doctor is not as good as I am - bunk.  Dangerous stuff.. 
 I picked up this book since it was in the 25 best american novels ever written according to the New-York Times.  Initially, I was interested since the story unfolds in Africa and I knew little about that continent, however, Norman Rush's prose feels really heavy, and, in the end, it wears you out.  I don't recommend this book, instead, pick up A fine balance by Rohinton Mistry. Much better story unfolding in another country 
 Although it appears to be a great product for the first couple of months... when it's done.. it's done!  It simply STOPPED working after 2 months.  If you purchase this item, be certain you purchase the small appliance replacement warranty from Amazon.. because the manufacturer certainly will not replace it!  
 This book is a poor application of the KM subject. It has non-sensical terms like "knowledge management server" that would only make sense to a Boeing engineer.. 
 The Incredibles is a totally stupid animated film.  The story is stupid, the voiceover stupid, the whole thing stupid 
 Mary Baxter should be thrown in prison for her major defamation of God's character and of Jesus Christ. I got so pissed off at her version God and Jesus by reading her garbage. I personally know that this is not the person God really is because I tend to be more of a universalists, but I have the greatest contempt and scorn for narrow minded hell driven bigots like Mary Baxter.  And it further ticks me off to see that people actually had their Christian faith strengthened by reading this book. How can they rejoice when they think that 75% of this failed god foresaken is going to be tormented forever in hell. Tell me how in the HELL that strengthens their faith and makes them "happy"? Praise Satan for evil people who call themselves Christians and actually enjoy this book. May they suffer in the afterlife! 
 The book reads very textbook-y, and already that's one strike against it. There were a few interesting things, like bundling beds and the fact that Pilgrims thought that women had to climax to conceive but other than that, nothing too insightful about sex 
 This book was wonderful, until the last chapter. WHAT HAPPENED!? Lieberman, I was with you until then. Hush is after Riddler, Riddler hires Joker, Joker lays the smack down on Hush, Hush hires Prometheus (I actually said aloud "Oh, Damn" when I saw that). Then the whole story is thrown out the window and it becomes a tie-in to the at-once pretty cool now seeming a little over-killed Infinite Crisis. Huh!? What!? I understand having to tie the "big crossover" in to Batman, but COME ON!! It was going so very, very well until then. I want the last hour of my life back 
 Micah was a pale contender to previous Anita books- There was very little action...outside of the bedroom anyway.. I like a little heat..but the plots from the first few books are what I became obsessed with. I couldn't put the books down...the Micah installment, I felt, was rushed..with little to no plot, or action. No evil to overcome. Just disappointing.  I was weary of even reading the books after some of the reviews I have read. And although I have started liking Micah, and accepted that Anita and Richard won't work out..this book was a letdown 
 This book is lacking for sensible sturcture. Seems to put a reader into a maze and leaves them wondering where there at. There are enough topics but their too full of proofs to really understand what the book is trying to explain. This book would even be diffucult for a graduate student that's using it for review. The author seems to be proving his mathematical talent instead of trying to explain the topics in a manor that's understandable to the average reader 
 After two weeks of very cool performance this thing went nuts! It used to change colors ever 15 or so seconds. Now it changes colors every 2 seconds. Looks like a strope light. It WILL drive you nuts! Plus, it completly soaks anything around it. You need to change "towels" under it twice a day! will ruin anything it's sitting on (moisture damage). Great idea but poor product. Not worth 51 bucks! Amazon says they will give money back. After buying hundreds of Amazon goodies this is the first thing I've got that is pretty much junk. DO NOT BY!!! Just read other reviews. Hope this helps 
 Like the title says, I'm being mad generous by giving this movie two stars...it really deserves none. Subspecies is an excellent, 4-part series written and directed by Full Moon Studio's Ted Nicholau (Actually, the first three Subspecies are allright, but the fourth movie sucks in my opinion). However, Vampire Journals is nothing more than a feeble attempt to portray a different side of the Subspecies archetype.   The characters, scenes, and acting in Subspecies Part 1-3 were superb. Yet this movie has an insipid plot and the actors are novice at best. The vampire teeth/fangs look horrid on most of the actors, and I was bored for the last 1/3 of the film.   Essentially, the plot...if you can even call it that pertains to a vampire named Zachary, who wants revenge for unwillingly being turned into what he is. So Zachary (Whoever thought to name a supposedly wise and powerful vampire Zachary anyway?) sets out to destroy an ancient and extremely lame vampire cult headed by Ashe, a fledgling of the main antagonist (Radu)of all the Subspecies films.  In addition to this, Zachary tries to rescue a female pianist named Sophia, who has been kidnapped by Ashe. Because she is a gifted musician...or something, Sophia is being forced by Ashe, a  fervid music lover, into becoming a vampire as well. Really there's not much else to go into, except that you should definitely not waste your time or your money on this film. So unless you're a die-hard Subspecies fan, or you basically just want to get drunk and have something to make fun of with your friends, try watching Subspecies 1-3 because they're the best you're gonna get from director Ted Nicholau 
 I was thinking this book was written from a Christian perspective.  WOW, was I wrong.  If your desire is to raise a WORLDLY, EGOTISTICAL, SELFISH and IMMORAL daughter then this is the book for you. I gave this book 1 star because zero and below was not an option 
 Luckily this book is only 160 pages, so I didn't waste too much time. It merely says Islamic countries used to be world-leaders, and now they're pretty backward. Very few examples of why and how this happened.  I thought it was going to be a history of Islam, but it's more a history of Islamic nations. It's sketchy, it's theoretical, and there's little filled in the middle of the ideas.   It'll say things like, "Modernity came from Christendom during the 18th and 19th centuries and changed the very way life was lived in Islamic countries." Then it gives no examples of what it means by that.  I applaud people who want to learn about Islam, but I recommend they buy a different book than this one 
 I wonder how long it will be before Frost's literary stock is devalued as much as it deserves to be. These are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. Frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader. What he has to say is obvious and unoriginal. How he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no better than a limerick. Posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his celebrity image as the New England farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed. How earlier generations could find genius in such obvious observations is astounding. Bad poetry from a twisted man 
 This is an inspiring story about one of the TRUE heroes of the United States, honored (much too late) both at home and abroad.  That being said, Bantam Books should be ASHAMED of the absolutely SHODDY, INFERIOR quality of this paperback edition!  When I opened my NEW copy, the first page in the photograph section fell out, which led me to look more closely at that section.  The pictures are so poorly reproduced that many, if not most, of them are barely recognizable as photographs!  Bantam Books has given this Great American Hero, Mr. Vernon J. Baker, the same disgraceful treatment that the U.S. Army gave him for so many years.  Reprehensible and unconscionable 
 My daughter received this as a present and while we were excited about all the activities that the book is capable of, it doesn't help if the book never works.  I don't know if it was the cartridge or the pencil, but the book does not recognize anything the pencil does and keeps repeating the initial book greeting over and over.  After reading the other comments on this book, I've decided not to replace it.  We'll wait until Leap Frog "fixes" the product line first 
 It's very good book in Probability and Statistics, a must-have for any researcher.  Book's Condition is bad. There're 2 pages severely scratched 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 I have studied,  practiced and taught managerial accounting for more than 17 years at work, using excellent supporting text and case books from recognized US authors. But to be honest Dr. Kaplan is making easy concepts to appear complicated and cumbersome. His case readings as well as the text materials are very length and hard to "digest" since it does not capture the attention of the reader.I would not recommend the book neither for and undergraduate or graduate degree, despite the well known and worldwide recognition of Dr. Kaplan. His book is far from being pedagogical in nature 
 Bought this one for Evolution class. It is a horrible excuse for a textbook. Do not buy this book unless it is for a middle school student. If the authors think this book has been written for an advanced audience, then I would suggest that anyone interested in learning evolution not attend University of Washington 
 I read other reviews in search of the best song of the movie but not on the soundtrack and I did some searching and found the CD but it's not on Amazon anymore although the page is still up, the name of the CD is "Peines De Maures / Arc-En-Ciel Pour Daltoniens [IMPORT]"by La Caution. You can probably buy it on ebay  or your local underground music store. 
 This product is JUNK! It is reccomended for ages 36 months to 4 yrs-----my son will be 4 in just 2 months----just right, right?---WRONG!!!!! The voice function to sound like yourself crapped out in less than 24 hours, and the microphone stopped functioning all together on the third day!!!!!! 
 I don't like this stupid book! It only teaches kids that "strangers" are bad people that wanna hurt you for fun, and the only "nice" people are the people you know. A kid in my brother's kindergarten class was too afaid to leave his house because of this book. They should of changed the title to "The Berenstain Bears Learn About Demented Killing Strangers. 
 Before I bought this watch, I did a lot of research on the offerings from Suunto, Polar and Nike, and finally ended up choosing the Lance 4 watch for my cycling-specific activities.  And I have to say, my disappointment began within 2 minutes of opening the shipping box.  Here are the three major ways this watch (and Nike itself) have failed me:  1) This is a complicated, multi-function instrument.  But if you're expecting a detailed instruction manual, forget it.  What you get is an elaborate pictograph that illustrates which buttons to push.  It skims over the setup procedure and many of the most important functions, and omits many features entirely.  2) Relative to the above complaint, I contacted Nike customer service about the setup.  Since I'm a cyclist, I was particularly interested in the altimeter function, and dismayed by how thin the "manual" is.  The instructions say you can select a 60-, 10- or 2-second sampling rate of the barometric pressure in order to determine altitude.  What it fails to mention is what the ramifications are for choosing one over the other?  Is one more accurate?  Does one use more battery power?  We'll apparently never know, because Nike's customer service failed to answer the question.  While they admitted that they had received several complaints about the manual -- and were considering writing a new one -- they simply sidestepped my question about the altimeter function in their email reply.  3)  And then there's the performance of the watch itself.  In most cases it's impressive -- that is, in every case except the one for which I purchased it:  the altimeter.  On my group rides, there are always at least three other people with altimeters.  A post-ride comparison of altimeter results always puts their readings within 3 percent of each other.  The results from the Nike are at least 20 percent off.  That means the altimeter results are not to be trusted.  While the watch is attractive (that's why it earned 2 stars instead of just one) and has an excellent band, it simply doesn't give me the accurate altimeter results I need.  And since the altimeter results are so far off, I can only assume that its built-in weather sensor (also based on barometric pressure) is hugely flawed, too.  With the manual being as light on information as it is, with Nike's customer service either unwilling or unable to shed any light on the watch's usage and with the flawed performance of the altimeter function, I can only say that this watch represents a major disappointment.  It may meet Nike's standards for fashion, but it fails my standards for performance 
 I can't believe after buying Rosle tools for years that the whisk I just got yeasterday is not made in Germany but China. On the label on the whisk it says China and yet in the review it says twice "Made in Germany".  Is anything by Rosle made in Germany anymore 
 I like Evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs, and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli relationship, sustained through 12 books so far, being a case in point. But Full Scoop was actually a trial to get through. I could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted Evanovich's comedic rhythm. The whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what I have come to expect from Evanovich. The silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent, leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened? The least forgivable of the sins committed in Full Scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between Maggie and Zack. None at all. So it's hard to label the book: a sort of but not really romance, an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger.... maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller 
 i'm a little confused as to the book description. it says "This condition is world wide due to exposure of chemicals and toxins." does the author try to prove trans people are like teenage mutant ninja turtles 
 First, let me state that I have read hundreds of books and have never written a bad review. This book is an exception.   I purchased this book hoping to read facts regarding women on plantations. I was disppointed as this book is based mainly on the writer's view versus historical facts. The book covers the period of 1780-1835. However, the author on multiple occasions refers to the Civil War period. Too much "bouncing" around throughout the years.   Yes, she does quote portions of historical letters but I felt these were used most likely out of context in order to support the writer's point of view without actual facts cited.  The writer's negativity toward other books written on plantation mistresses and their authors, which she refers to frequently in the book, are deplorable. Why mention them at all. It only makes one want to read the books that she things so little of.  Harsh...yes perhaps this review is harsh. Bottom line, I read the book and would not recommend it as good factual reading.  
 I have not read this book. However I have recieved multiple unwanted and unsolicited email messages touting it. If this book is really so good why do they resort to using SPAM email messages to market it 
 Why would you like this book? If you already knew a ton about history and were looking for new comparative methods of evaluating the modern world. There's certainly an interesting argument set forth by Bayly, but I remain unconvinced that his methods of documentation (reliance on secondary sources and a self-avowed lack of references) and his choice of material (severe neglect of certain portions of the world) should permit this book to be the academic blockbuster it has been claimed.  Why would you hate this book? If you were anyone else, especially a layperson, trying to get a good sense of why things are the way they are today. It's dense, scattered persepctive will ultimately leave you more confused than enlightened. 
 Anyone choosing this book on the basis of the title will be disappointed, since it has nothing to do with architecture and nothing to do with transportation. Instead, this book consists of 22 collections of photographs, all of which take unorthodox approaches to photography in urban settings. We have such things as photos of the pattern of pipes on the ceilings of Paris subway stations, an artificial mountain in the Netherlands made of garbage, snapshots someone found laying in the street, fictitious typed letters between a photographer and some imaginary character, street markings that have been spray-painted by municipal workers, and so on. Despite the editor's introductory essay, I'm mystified as to why this book exists 
 I thought this book started very strong; it set up everything very well, and i could start to see the themes emerging from the work. But then the author decides to have these long-winded conversations with herself that are very hard to follow. She uses hyphens instead of quoation marks to represent dialogue. The major problem with this is she combines more hyphens when she breaks away from conversation to describe how the person is talking or to depict a scene taking place. Sometimes she doesn't even bother to start another paragraph when the dialogue starts back up again. So this results in a very confusing read as it's hard to tell if someone is talking, or if it's a scene, or could it be how they are talking, or is it an aside, or is it just a thought, or maybe this is a convo, and who is talking again, oh, maybe she is describing the surrondings....?   It drove me Crazy 
 While I'm sure Lucinda has found a niche with this book and helped others, I would warn those in a deep depression or those struggling with severe anxiety to pass this by.  The book, to me, did not bring the results I had hoped for - it actually made me more aware of the difference between mild and serious anxiety/depression.  If you have been treated for, or feel you have, severe depression there is a chance you may become more discouraged.  Lucinda dealt with anxiety about getting on a plane and speaking in front of people, among other things.  I agree with some posters above that the emphasis is on her experience which held little more than her TV commercials contain.  The skills she suggest, basically positive thinking techniques, were nothing new.   They can be found in other books and magazines.  There were no insights.  Lucinda does not have a PhD and admits to only sharing her experience.  With so much hype about her books, a seriously depressed or person with a serious social anxiety disorder might just compare their pain with Lucinda and find they have have nothing in common and end up sinking lower 
 The lowest rating is one star, but I would give it a zero star. This book is 125 pages with one side blank to make it look bigger - if both sides of a page were written on, there'd be 63 pages - so you see what we're dealing with here.  The "key techniques" are comprised of bending your forward arm at 90 degrees on the backswing and placing the ball in the same position ("at the level of the inside forward foot") with every club. Eleven pages are devoted to vitamins & minerals. Folks, we're dealing here with little substance and much fluff. The author may be a great golfer but he is unable to convey to his audience how he does it in sufficient detail. Spend your money on a book by Jack Nicklaus called "Golf My Way" - a top golf book. Jack provides rationale and detail galore - I'd rate his book at 10 stars.            
 The people who have reviewed this book with 5 stars are simply  ignorant or they are pro-Nazi sympathizers. By their logic, the US of A was on the wrong side during WW II. We should've helped the freedom-loving Hitler beat the freedom-hating Stalin.  This book contains nothing but distortions, misinformation, and circumstatial evidence which doesn't "demonstrate" or "prove" anything, except that the author hates communists.   In one of the most ironic things I've ever seen posted on the internet, one reviewer - Darren Boggs who's serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom - mentioned that Hoffman's book debunks the "myth of German aggression". He sees the book as a rationale for "pre-emptive war".  Thus an American soldier, who's actually taking part in a "pre-emptive war" reads a pro-nazi history book and comes to the conclusion that Hitler and George W Bush were both right.  Is this book on US Army reading lists or something? Did the Pentagon send copies out to the troops so they could feel a bit better about their pre emptive war? Good. God. By the way, I strongly reccomend you read something more accurate by David Glantz or Volkogonov, the recent crop of books on 1941 
 So, you find yourself almost 400 pages into a book you are writing and you run short of ideas. What do you do?  A.	add some horrible time travel paradoxical ending or  B.      have the main character hit by a semi as he crosses the street 
 the on-the-rock marriage scenes are pathetic, making this already lukewarm and loose thriller become even worse. from the very beginning, this female washington reporter knew what mitch rapp did for a living, yet she continuously whined, intervened, demanded, complained, pried into her husband jobs and duties. what is this? trying to make rapp look more humanly realistic, making him look more like the stereotyped american husband? making us enable to enter rapp's bedroom, wathching 'war of the roses'? come on, this is a thriller, not jackie collins or danielle steele's 'honey, no sex tonight'. get rid of the nagging wife pronto! also, this novel is not up to the standard of a good thriller. a story falling apart in many ways 
 This system is very expensive, but Bose didn't even bother to put an optical input so that you can get the optimal sound from your dvd player.  I strongly think that Bose likes to rip off consumers.  I say so because if they had placed an optical input, then there would be very little difference between this system, and their 3-2-1 system. A system that Bose retails for twice as much money  
 Setting aside Gardner's overt racism and fanciful unfounded theories... this book just doesn't come close to a true explanation of Tolkien's work.  It heaps incorrect assumptions atop falsified 'facts' to twist Tolkien's work around to support Gardner's delusions.  The sources and nature of Tolkien's work are readily available in the 'History of Middle-earth' series edited by his son Christopher and 'The Letters of JRR Tolkien' edited by Humphrey Carpenter.  Copies of the original draft materials Tolkien wrote are given as well as his own statements about his meanings and the historical connections to his work.  Gardner gets almost EVERYTHING wrong... to the point that one must assume he didn't actually review any of this extensive material from Tolkien himself.  Instead, Gardner simply took the finished book and started inventing a history and basis for it which would conform with Gardner's own theories of racial superiority.  Which Tolkien called "the wholly pernicious race doctrine" espoused by that "ruddy little ignoramous" Adolf Hitler.  His reaction to Gardner would undoubtedly have been similar.  If you want to learn more about Tolkien and his stories this book has nothing to offer you.  It is all about co-opting Tolkien's name to further an agenda he despised. 
 Don't waste your time an money on this diatribe against the United States and our President. George Soros is at best a weak Socialist, and most probably is a true Communist - except that he has what he wants (money) and now he going to tell the rest of us how terrible our country is, and how we should live. I am sorry I contributed to his tainted wealth by buying this book 
 After slightly over a year, the liner developed a couple of chips and, upon closer examination, two cracks along the height of the liner. These developed the last time I used it--in one use and for no apparent reason. Though I love the way the cooker looks, I've never used it for anything other than slow cooking so its versatility is useless to me. Even if a replacement liner was available, I would worry this would happen again (with food inside?) so I'm going back to the stoneware style--which lasts many, many years 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 This book is one of the worst cases of feminist propaganda and male bashing that I have ever had the chance to review.  This book is loaded with problems that are present in society and the author seems to make sure that it is blamed on sports and men who participate in sports.  If you where looking for a well balanced text on sports look else where because you will find no other opinion but the authors and the feminist in this book.  The major reason that I do not like this book is because it blames men for everything that is wrong and makes sports out to be just this real evil event we participate in.  Much of the information in this book is dated as well with much of the case studies done primarily in the 50s, 60s, and 70s, which makes much of the information irrelevant.  It ignores any other point of view and is completely biased and is a dishonest book that passes its information off as absolutes but rarely backs up any of its claims.  This is a Feminist propaganda book plain and simple and should not be considered anything else 
 This reminded me of a Nancy Drew story in which Nancy gets laid, more than once.  If this seems vulgar, then prepare yourself for a big surprise if you read this book.  Contrived "in the nick of time" encounters hobble the already weak suspense, and stereotypes abound. You'll be happier with some James Lee Burke 
 Trying to mix the positive thinking of Robert Schuller, and the faith movement theology of Paul Yonggi Cho and Kenneth Copeland, Osteen has taken the stadium seminar circuit to a new level. Augmented now by his book, "Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential" he pushes the find the god/champion within yourself.  Here, we see he has a study guide to help point out what is not difficult to understand with his book. To his credit, there are a few more Scriptures laced into this guide. However, the main book is not making any points that a study guide will enhance, and only the lowliest of sheep will need the extra help.  People who are down on their luck, or discouraged with life will find Osteen a good read. It is a feel-good book, reducing the image of Christianity to be about us and not about God. Bigger than life is Osteen's picture on the cover, knowing that if you saw him on TV, you might want his book.  "Getting your mind off of yourself," with the goal of self-fulfillment should appeal also to readers of Wayne W. Dyer and other authors looking to reach those who feel disenfranchised.   Osteen's rambling, choppy speaking style comes through, written like he's campaigning for office. Reading like a seminar set to print, it sums as quickly as reading through its self-determinist table of contents:   1. Enlarge your vision  2. Develop a healthy self-image  3. Discover the power of your thoughts and words  4. Let go of the past  5. Find strength through adversity  6. Live to give  7. Choose to be happy   The steps sound innocuous, and, outside of their religious context, are. Within their religious context, evangelicals and charismatics will likely find offense at Osteen's assertions about controlling your own destiny as opposed to letting God control it.   Aim a little higher, and check out Charles Colson's "The Good Life." The title sounds similar, but Colson defines what makes for a good life far differently than Osteen. Save your money, and if you have Osteen's book, read it without the guide.  Anthony Trendl  editor, HungarianBookstore.co 
 I have never read dialogue so contrived in my entire life. The tension between Adam and Becca had not point of origin. The tension between Adam and Tyler was stereotypical, to say the least. The way the author ridded the characters and reader of any residual guilt/frustration/regret in regards to Tyler was totally unrealistic and disgustingly half-hearted. Such a cop out! The entire "love" story was based on notions of "Gee, you're hot! I wanna have sex with you! We must be in love!" When, at a rather crucial moment Adam said "Even my molecules are horny" I stood up, threw the book across the room, and laughed for ten mintues straight. I didn't keep it or sell it; I threw it in the bin where it belongs. It was utter trash 
 I bought this book after reading The Third Secret, thinking I'd get another good read. I was so wrong. The Romanov Prophecy is predictable from page 1. About halfway through, it turns into one long chase scene. There are no plot twists or turns, you know exactly what's going to happen from the beginning. I started to quit about 2/3 of the way in, but felt I had too much time invested to just drop it. There are much better thrillers out there. Try The Historian. Fantastic book 
 The author offers critiques, but rarely offers a better idea or redesign. It's the same with his other book about home page usability. This is a severe shortcoming.  A related problem is that some of his criticisms are just unfounded or - in my humble opinion - just plain wrong. And I'm coming to the conclusion that that's why he doesn't offer solutions - a web site is a tradeoff between competing goals. It's actually not that difficult to find "problems" with sites; it's much more difficult to fix those problems and find that sweet spot 
 This is a relatively straightforward propaganda melodrama, with nothing particularly compelling to recommend it, but for one notable exception.  Bertold Brecht's villains and miscreants are all so full of gusto. They share kinship with the ones in Threepenny Opera and Mahagonny after all. It seems Brecht could not create a scoundrel he couldn't admire on a certain, mischievous level. The ones in this film are no exception, and lift it out of the "ordinary" into the realm of the "oddity" 
 All in all, a good read. Could have been better, but then again I've never written - drawn - plotted so much as a grocery list, let alone a comic series. SPOILER - The origin of Ms. Wagner 
 Despite all the good reviews, this game is pathetic. Here are the reasons:  Horrible Stereotypes: If you're a Brujah character, you'll be like every other Brujah in existence. It's just that simple, if you want Celerity and Potence you play Brujah, if you want Presence you play Ventrue (those who've read the book understand the last sentence). The only good way to get a nice mix is to make a Clanless (Munchkin Alert!) or make up your own Clan (which Vamp players hate, because it forces them to think)  LARPs: I've chased LARP groups out of the graveyard near my house more than once. I hate them only because they don't respect the dead (or those that work during the day and SLEEP at night). You all don't have to LARP to play the game, I read the book. Sit around a table and eat pretzels like all other RPGers. Don't be afraid, it might develop your character and imagination to not run around at midnight and annoy all your neighbors and people who think you're in a dark section of the SCA.  Too expensive: For a book with no color whatsoever (and barely a system), it's as much as all the other RPGs on the market. Did I miss something? No color is stylish? That costs Extra?   Munchkin Factor 3: You'll have at least 3 munchkins in your group if you play with 4-6 characters. These munchkins usually have goth tendencies. No offense to goths, but y'all force normal people to hate you.   Game Mechanics are weak like a wet paper towel: the Soak die rules leave much to be desired, as two combatants could pound on eachother forever (I believe I had combat with 2 combatants last 3 hours once). The skills system is dumb, making a weak character able to do great things if he has enough of the skill.  Uncompatibility: All the WOD games CANNOT be played with one another. Mages are more powerful than Werewolves are more powerful than Vampires are more powerful than Hunters. Have fun you amalgamers!  We're Roleplayers!: The pompusness of Vamp players is quite annoying, since the system roleplays for them. Anyone could game Vampire. It's the same reason d20 has no respect with the game community elders (at least in my mind).  Finally, Suggestions: Don't play Vampire the Masquerade. If you really want a vampire game, upgrade to Vampire: the Requiem.  It's done much better than this tras 
 I read this book in college, not as part of a course, but out of curiousity because it was the favorite whipping boy of many of my peers and professors.  After reading it, I understood why.  The effect of this book, intended or not, is to preserve the reverence for the outdated "Western canon".  Ultimately, I found the book self-serving in the extreme, as it secures Hirsh's place in academia, if it is believed.  I admit that reading the list of items Hirsch thinks we should know and trying to place them is an amusing parlor game.  However, one should not draw conclusions about one's self worth from success or failure at this game.  The list itself is deeply flawed for more than one reason.  First, it is heavily weighted towards the knowledge of old college professors, not young college professors, and certainly not college students.  Second, it is heavily weighted by Hirsch's Anglophilia.  Third, although it does not purport to be exhastive, the danger of any list, and this one is no exception, is that it will be taken as exhaustive by the lazy reader.  Finally, Hirsch's argument that his concept of cultural literacy is finally pragmatic and not philosophical in that it lays the groundwork of "common experience" for students and teachers is particularly narrow.  Hirsch must have been wearing cultural blinders when he wrote this not to see that much of the common experience that people draw on today is formed not by the Academy, but by popular culture.  Hirsch's argument breaks down here because he tries to force the popular culture of a different age upon the public so that they will have a common experience with him, instead of exposing himself current pop culture simply because it doesn't meet his narrow aesthetic criteria.  If you read this book, read it as a cautionary tale about trying to quantify any concept so nebulous as "cultural literacy."  Interrogate the precepts of this book by trying to have a converstaion about Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its relationship to religion among American teenagers with any of your "old guard" religion or philosophy professors.  Now who's culturally illiterate 
 I found this book to contain many recipes that contain ingredients that I can't have (I'm in the early stages of treatment so fruits, nuts, some grains, etc. are out for now) and many ingredients that Dr Crook suggests avoiding for a while in newer books. I'm sure the recipes will be more usefull after I've completed treatment and I'm working on maintenance, but that's not what I needed right now. Some tips on how to cook beans and veggies were somewhat helpfull but I think there are better books out there for the early staged of treatment. Consider getting it from your library before buying it 
 i would only play on friday this is no good for m 
 first complaint- the arbitrary exclusion af artists they may not personally like- George Harrison, Emerson Lake and Palmer, etc. Second complaint- inconsistent reviews. Third complaint- the R rated languagein mnay reviews/ The guide dismisses anything remotely to do with progressive rock as garbage, they laud unpopular rubbish and overall a big disappointment. For the money, they could have done a lot better. The All Music Guides do a lot better 
 My 10-month old babies have no interest in this book, and they love board books 
 This movie definitely had the potential to be gteat, the action scenes are pretty good.  But the love story in this movie seems like even the actors were dozing off during there own scenes.    The final fight did't work for me either, and the very last scene I thought was pretty unnecessary.  Did anyone really remember Joey Wong was in this movie by the time that the end came.    The commentary on the DVD was one of the better ones that I have heard from ric meyers 
 i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
 I have had this system for 9 monthis now, and I am sure this is the worst piece of AV equipment I have ever owned.  Sony is usually known for quality products, but it this case I am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market.  The worst part is that I have had numerous problems with it.  Occasionaly it fails to recognize CD/DVD inserted after you turn it off and back on.  On other occasions it completely locks up.  The first time it happened I had to call Sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it. Now, after about 9 months of use, it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message "PROTECT UNPLUG".   The only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes.  There is nothing wrong with my electric wiring -- I have checked, and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge protector/power conditioner.  I am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it -- at this point it's just not worth it because of all the other things I despise about this system.    First off, CDs and DVDs take forever to load.  To insert a disk one has to press an "Eject" button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk.  If you missed your chance -- tough luck, start all over.  Second, it is a royal pain to use -- any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be.  On screen menus, a standard on most systems, now do not exist, and the manual is a joke. Third, the FM radio is awful.  I went out and spent money on an expensive FM antenna -- still, my cheap clock radio gets better reception.  Fourth, there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review.    Finally, I don't share people's opinion that the sound is all that great.  It's average.  Out-of-the-box it is way too heavy on bass.  The wireless feature is nice -- I admit, and that was the reason I bought it.  But I would not buy it again (or probably another piece of Sony equipment) in a million years now.  I could live with wires running around my room, or even just a two-speaker system rather than deal with this piece of junk. Shame on Sony for slapping their name on this lemon.    
 My gripe is about KQ6.  One customer said that there were no differences between the cd and disk versions. This information is false. At the time of its origional release, I was fortunate to have a high end computer (for its time) that was able to run the Windows CD version of KQ6 which had much better graphics and Character Illustrations. I was beyond upset when I found out that this was nothing but the DOS version. I bought this to play the windows version that to my knowlage does not work in any way on any OS past win95 (maybe 98). Those who have played and have been waiting to play the Windows CD version will be very upset 
 I just wonder if this would have been published without the author's being married to an author;  I find his stuff repetitively boring as well.  This is a simplistic story of an orphan wife who acts as though she can't stand her husband and seems to glory in anything she can do to upset him  Her friend in these endeavors is an obviously manic / depressive (sorry, term has been replace by bi-polar victim ) whose wealth seems to make her the star.  Their enemy is the EVIL (can't use that word either) Eagle Forum which is trying to close down the local store where the kids get their drug paraphanalia.  It seems that both ladies have problems (oops, not allowed any more by the political correctness police, I mean 'issues') with their male counterparts.  They act like they hate their husbands.  I'd recommend this to anyone who hates Religious people and loves to see kids getting in trouble with drugs.  A dog . .  
 Just finished this read and I am still wondering why.  It started out well enough; the story idea was original and interesting, but I should have figured it out when the "Indiana Jones stuff" started. The writing FOR THESE EXCITING PARTS WERE BIT OVERDONE!!!!  And then we are back to normal again, NO WAIT!  SOMETHING EVEN MORE EXCITING AND LESS PROBABLE IS HAPPENING NOW!!!!  Anyhow, I felt my 8th grader could have probably written this book.  So I had nothing more to read and I continued.  I should have stopped, because as you know if you have read the other reviews... the Davinci Code junk started.  What a load!  Jesus is now gay?  Couldn't come up with a variation of those gnostic views huh?  So lets make some stuff up and cause a controversy so we can sell books.  I really hate to tell you Mr. Reilly but thats not a new idea either. Very low quality read, in other words don't waste the time reading this when you can watch paint dry, water boil, or even watch a cake bake.  And if you are a late night reader as I am you would be better off going to sleep 
 I would like to thank everyone for listing the song Send me on my way.  I was specifically looking for this song and did expect it to be on the CD.  So thank you all for looking out for the other people interested 
 To rehash about 2,000 other reviews: this book is tripe.  Worthless.  Offensive to anyone who felt any connection to this series' world and characters.  I think I may have a pretty good idea of what happened, though, and I hope it gives some hope for the future.  It's the Michael Crichton syndrome.  Remember long ago, when Michael Crichton wrote extremely entertaining novels based wholly on his strengths?  He is obviously very bright, and has a real talent for turning ideas about hard-science into fun dramas, like The Andromeda Strain.  Then he became so popular, and so lauded, that he started to believe his own hype.  He read so many reviews of his own books citing him as the greatest writer ever, and as the man whose every word was golden, that he started to believe it.  And so he started to write books filled with what he thought was subtle intrigue, pithy character interaction, and literary depth.  Unfortunately, he wasn't that kind of writer.  He wasn't Delillo, or Dickens, or Wolfe, and he shouldn't have tried to be.  So those books ended up being further towards the 'crappy' end of the spectrum.  Then something happened - I don't know if his editors pulled in the reigns, or if his family sat him down to have a talk, or maybe he started to pay attention to the fans that he was disappointing (I hope).  Whatever it was, it got him to accept a bit of humility, and to go back to his strengths.  The results being Timeline, and then Prey - fun books about hard-science extrapolated into entertaining dramas.  So therein lies my hope for Robert Jordan.  His strengths are in describing an interesting world, in creating things that are mysterious and engaging, and in writing very cool action sequences.  Recently he seems to think he's the next F. Scott Fitzgerald; and failing spectacularly.  He obviously, for example, thinks that he has something deeply important to say about the sexes and about the clash of cultures, and maybe he does, but he sucks at saying it.  More importantly, IT'S NOT WHY WE READ THE WHEEL OF TIME.  If we want to read about the subtleties of culture and its affect on the interactions we have, there's plenty of Dostoevsky available.  Mr. Jordan obviously possesses a stubbornness akin to that he ascribed to the people of the home village of his protagonists (whoever they are anymore).  I just hope that eventually someone will smack him hard enough to wake him up, and we'll find ourselves with another "Eye of the World" or "The Great Hunt" 
 I have read some bad books before, but never have had to talk myself into finishing one hoping it would get better.  It didn't. Don't waste your time or money 
 We were forced to read this book in philosophy class some years back and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men and  inability of see the beauty and wonder of intercourse.Her view of women isn't much better in that they are supposedly the poor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such a  distasteful act as intercourse.The male in her book is the  aggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willing  victim to only get children and love in return.If she can't see the pleasure of the sex act then it's no one's fault but hers. Every page of the book was hard to read.I don't know why some people bother to read such books because it's a waste of  trees,paper and time! Another problem is she makes it sound as though women who  like intercourse aren't up to her intellectual level,as though she has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse. She tries to make very subjective material sound like it's  supposed to be the objective norm for every woman.Not!!! Very dangerous book 
 Looking for insight into the "future" of advertising, I decided to read this book. Makes sense given the title. Much of the book, ironically, is dedicated to the history of advertising. It gives little indication where things are headed other than they are changing. If you're not in marketing or advertising, maybe it's fresh and interesting. For those in this business, 95% of this book is "yeah, now tell me something I don't know. 
 they are very shiney and but not very comfortable at all and the arch is funn 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 The timing in this story is achingly slow, compared to many of today's novels...the language is not particularly metaphorical or even colorful, although the sentences are short.  But lacking dialogue it remains dull, dull and I am unable to visualize the characters - more description is needed, and frankly, if it wasn't for previous success he may not have been published.  I feel you have to be an anglophile to appreciate this book 
 In the begginning i was impressed by the title but disappointed by the quality of its material besides the font is very bad and hard to read , very small sketches hard to see , and the ideas exploration is not accomplished ,so never start with this book for this subject ... 
 I'd be okay with a story that had 1 or 2 last-second escapes, but this book has at least 10, if not more!  I think the author spent too much time watching action films and incorporated every single escape trick into one book.  Even a Bond film would not go this far out on a limb.  They only other Reilly book I've read is The Contest, which I suppose was just as far fetched, but I give that one more latitude since it was science fiction and this one is not.  Another complaint is that a 16th century manuscript is woven into the story - which is not a bad idea - but there was no effort at all to change the language to the appropriate era.  The book does have a lot of action though... so if you like wild adventure and can completely suspend reality, you'd probably enjoy.  Appropriateness:  I would like to have recommended this as a fun action book for teens, but be aware that it contains a lot of language and a lot of violence.  There are many gruesome deaths of all varieties.  There is no sexual content or discussion of it 
 This was my first Bertrice Small book and I have to say I was not impressed.  I did not care for the character at all.  She was spoiled, and self rightous to everyone, including her family.  I also thought the book was extremely boring.  There was to much descrpition on small mundane things and not enough plot and action.  It took me forever to get through this book and I am a very fast reader.  This book made me not want to read any of her other books because I am afraid that they will be just as bad.  I hope this was a one time oops for Ms. Small because this book was not good at all 
 I am a huge fan of "Savin Hill" and I've been waiting patiently for "Back To The World" [...] Anyways, it is out now on Brass Tacks/DRT Entertainment (I actually got a promo copy a few weeks ago).  Anyways, I'm not as impressed with "Back To The World" as I was with their previous effort. It isn't as tough, it's more "Punk Lite" (less filling).  Some general remarks about "Back to The World" -Mike's vocals are at the forefront of the mix. Sometimes good but it really hinders the album when the lyrics are weak. -None of the songs totally suck. They each contain some really good elements; but there are only a handful of songs where all of the elements (music, lyrics, melodies) come together. -Musically, the album is lacking variation. The guitar and bass work sounds the same in about 80 percent of the songs.  This would have been okay for a few songs, but it makes the album sound like a collection of b-sides and gets taxing torwards the end. For those of you with "Savin Hill" think nine songs that sound just like "Declaration". Yeah it is a good song but not for a whole 30 minutes. -Very polished, adds to the lack of variation. -The drumming is fantastic.  Song by song play for "Back To The World".  Strike A Blow - The guitar in the beginning is cool but the lyrics are severely lacking.  I'm really disappointed with this for an opening track, it is very mediocre.  Maybe I hold the Street Dogs to a higher level but I was expecting that they would be above a song concerning "how the radio doesn't want to play us".  You Alone - For the loners out there, this song is for you.    In Defense of Dorchester - Good music and group vocals (I'm a sucker for songs with good sing-a-longs) on this one.  Hokey lyrics and I don't like how Mike sings "Dooooooor-Cheeee-s-der", when he hits the "der" it almost hurts (The McColgan mafia will probably be after me for this comment).  Back To The World - Upbeat tune, good music and good group vocals in the last minute of the song?but after hearing the power/passion that Mike put into "Far Away Coast", the lyrics in this song just sound so cheesy especially for such a significant issue.  Tale of Mass Deception - Great lyrics. When I first downloaded this from their website back in September, I loved the lyrics but not so much the music. The accordion didn't do it for me, I would have preferred a straight acoustic guitar number. I have to say that the accordion has really grown on me. Best song on the album after-Drink Tonight.  Drink Tonight - Yeah baby. How do you make a huge old-tyme hardcore tune... Throw in some guest vocals from Blood for Blood, that's what you do. Best song on the album and the little kid at the end cracks me up.  Stagger - Starts of with a high polished electric reggae beat (think Clash "Sandinista/Combat Rock" sound) but then kicks in.  Adds some well needed sound variation (if only in the intro). Lyrics are a wee like bree but the melody of the chorus more than makes up for it.  White Collar Fraud - One of the stronger "Declaration" sounding songs. It's got a good beat and I can sing-a-long to it.  Patrick - It seems that during this song my brain turns the volume down because it is all beginning to sound the same. Eyes are also glazing over.  Pull The Pin - This song has a great chorus that turns my brain volume back-up (ever so slightly though).  But after hearing 7 previous songs that sound the same, it is still tiring.  Hands Down - Meaningful lyrics.  Too bad the music is boring by this point.   Union and The Law - "Savin Hill" ended with an acoustic song about labor and it worked really well there, so we'll just do the same with this album. Unfortunately, it just adds to the "b-side" psychosis of "Back To The World".   In conclusion, if they cut 5 songs, the Street Dogs could have had a good EP.  But since they didn't I did. Suggested song order if you make your own: In Defense of Dorchester, You Alone, Tale of Mass Deception, Drink Tonight, Stagger, White Collar Fraud, and Pull The Pin. 
 This was a mess. This movie gave me the feeling that I was was watching a really bad made for tv film. I was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was. Everyone just seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles. Viggo Mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan. All in all, this film was predictable, formulaic and a bore. Please save your money for something worthwhile 
 I love the idea behind this game and it's pretty impressively exectuted. I had three gripes though: 1) It's so fast paced that I found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure. 2)I couldn't get the magnify and reduce (with quick little circles) to work.  This caused me great frustration. 3)There's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times. I quit playing it pretty quickly 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 what a rip off 150$ for this stupid book. the writers should be arreste 
 Don't get me wrong i'm a big fan of Snoop but what is it with this album. I just can't believe that people could think that this is even close to Doggystyle, let alone better!!! This has got to be his furthest album from Doggystyle. Well I do like 7 tracks which are Bang Out, Ups & Downs, The Bidness, Snoop D.O. Double G, Perfect, Promise I and Oh No. But the rest of the album is totally wack!!! I mean how could someone who used to be a hardcore gangsta rapper end up making this crap. I just hope he'll do better for his upcoming album "The Blue Carpet Treatment". By the way here are my ratings for the songs 1. I Love To Give You Light (Intro) N/A 2. Bang Out 10/10 Great track, good start to the album 3. Drop It Like It's Hot 5.5/10 Very overrated song. What the hell is Pharell doing on a track with Snoop. 4. Can I Get A Flicc Witchu 6/10 Don't like this either. Boring song with a joke of a beat. 5. Ups & Downs 10/10 Got to be my favourite song on the album. Deserved to become a single. 6. The Bidness 10/10 A good gangsta track. 7. Snoop D.O. Double G 10/10 Another great gangsta track. 8. Let's Get Blown 4.5/10 Another weak as overrated track. 9. Step Yo Game Up 0/10 Horrific Song. What the f*** is that Lil Jon idiot doing on here. Hate this song. 10. Perfect 8.5/10 It's not gangsta but I still enjoy this song. 11. WBALLZ N/A 12. Fresh Pair Of Panties On 0/10 Horrific song!!! The lyrics and topic are absolutely wack. 13. Promise I 9/10 Pretty gangsta, a fantastic chorus. 14. Oh No 10/10 Another gangsta as track. Along with 50 Cent (A good guest appearance) 15. Can U Control Yo H** 0/10 Horrific song!!! Again with an absolutely wack topic and lyrics. 16. Signs 0/10 Horrific song!!! What the f***** hell is Justin Timberlake doing on here? 17. I'm Threw Witchu 0/10 Horrific song!!! A beat is awful and its extremely repeatative. 18. Pass It Pass It 5/10 Another plain boring song. 19. Girl Like U 0/10 Horrific song!!! Nelly, what the hell!!! 20. No Thang On Me 0/10 Horrific song!!! Another extremely repeatative song. Probably my least favourite on the whole album.    
 The original was a very effective, cautionary horror tale.  The remake can't seem to make up its mind what it wants to be -- it definitely isn't scary -- and it doesn't include what I thought to be one of the more important bits from the original, the exchange between Katherine Ross' character and the psychiatrist before she gets taken back home and roboticized. I will say the revised ending does add some important food for thought.  
 The NATURE'S FIRE VOLCANO also used to be sold at the Discovery Channel Stores. My kid loved it while it worked. Lasted about a month. All of the reviews stated the same on their site. Lasts from 1 to 3 months. Wish I had checked it before we bought it. Save your money 
 THe book tries to say back injuries are stress. I dont think herniated discs or annular tears heal in a couple of weeks. A Social Security Doctor just recommended me to read this. Even though my injures were hernaitons with annual tears. So even though he was aware of my injuries he still must think its stress related . WHAT A JOKE. BOOK STINK 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  One thing that I hate about the book is that it has ads in the back.  The ads are for seven other books.  I expect to see ads in magazines, but when I pay for a book I don't want advertising.  More importantly, the writing is awkward and hard to understand.  For example, here's how she describes relational databases:  "A relational database is a collection of 'data items' that are organized as a set of linked tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without need to reorganize the database tables (a table is referred to as a 'relation')."  Huh?!  That description is confusing and much of it is wrong.  How can data be "reassembled"?  What does she mean by "without need to reorganize the database tables"?  Database tables can have foreign keys or referential integrity, but they are not "linked".  Each table is its own independent entity.   She continues, "The columns in all of the tables must depend upon a single key column with values that don't repeat."  That's not true either.  It's very common to have a table with multiple keys or no keys whatsoever.  The author explains that "SQL is a declarative language, which means that the user specifies what he or she wants and then the RDBMS query planner figures out how to get it."  But that's not what "declarative language" means at all.  I tried to work my way through the poor writing and typos, but after a while I lost confidence that the information in the book was accurate and I put it down 
 I don't know what the other reviewers got out of this book, as it contains nothing but a hodgepodge of scales, notes, & chords with no real explaination of what is going on or why.    I can read music but if you are a guitar player used to tabs, you won't like this.  You'd be better off buying something geared towards guitar, such as REH Jazz Solos for Guitar.    You'll gain a "jazz vocabulary" by playing, by imitating, and then creating something from that, but not by anything in this book.  There is no approach, no method, nor any useful information in this book.       
 I'm not sure who wrote the positive reviews here, but I can tell you as a student using this book that it is among the worst I've ever been stuck with and most of my classmates seem to agree.  The concepts are made much more difficult than they should be by poor writing.  The authors jump around constantly, use new terminology at times before introducing it, and provide examples that are inadequate in helping to solve the problems at the end of the chapter.  Stylistically, the writing is very bland and sure to put you to sleep.  The first sentence of the book is "This is a book about signals and systems."  Sure, this book may cover all of the core concepts involved in signal processing, but trying to make sense of it when you don't already have a background in the subject is quite a challenge.  After reading the chapters, we were unable to solve most of the problems in the book until given the answers were given to us.  I've dealt with bad textbooks before, but this one tops them all.  Needless to say, it was very frustrating experience and I can't say I recommend this book 
 I couldn't watch this till the end. Bad production values, gimmicky, desperate to make a point about violence and voyeurism and evil and wanting to make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide from the énnui.   If you wanna go all deep thoughts on violence and still get shaken - both intelectually and viscerally - try something like Miike's "Ichi the Killer". Makes this movie look so, so needless.  The leading man looked geeky and occasionally cute. 2 stars for the eye candy 
 I was deceived.  This is not a dating book on meeting women.  It is a book for those who want to learn how to become a "John" and buy sex.  Tips on finding hookers, protecting yourself from disease that you might get from hookers, what to do to make sure the hooker is not a cop, what to do if the hooker is a cop - if that sort of thing is your bag.  
 This book reads like a graduate thesis. It manages to bury interesting ideas with overly drawn out explanations and arguments. Each chapter should be pared down to a third of its length, but I recommend not finding out for yourself; spend your money elsewhere 
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 I am very disappointed with this book.  I wanted a book to help me keep track of my daily intake of calories. Not pages and pages full of the author's opinions and tips on weight loss. A lot of the items listed are commercial food that by law have to carry nutrition info anyway. I am prefectly capable of reading a nutrition lable for calories, I don't need the added step of finding it in this book, which doesn't have a very good order of listing items in my opinion. Instead I recommend "The Doctors Pocket Calorie, Fat & Carbohydrate Counter: 2002 Edition, Plus 101 Fast Food Chains and Restaurants" and "The Complete and Up-to-Date Fat Book: A Guide to the Fat, Calories and Fat Percentages in Your Food" - both of which are available from amazon 
 Boring, repetitious, snarky, unfocused, poorly edited, mistake-ridden, and next to unreadable.  The book is subtitled "The Black Death & the World it Made."  The (very) few points it made about the plague's effects on history and society--the reason I chose this book--were so deeply buried they almost slipped by me.   To say this book is poorly edited is to assume that an editor looked at it at all.  I wish I had the text electronically, though, so I could count how many times the author used the word "biomedical" (sometimes several times on one page.)  He also thinks microorganisms are "toxic" and that noisome means noisy.  The text is often internally inconsistant.  For example, in one place he explains that a plague sufferer can have internal abdominal buboes, and in another place says that the lack of external buboes means that another disease was responsible for some cases attributed to the Black Death. He refers to plague both by its scientific name Y. pestis, and by the outdated term pasteurelle (sic) pestis--in the same paragraph. In the bibliography section, he conflates (or confuses) biological weapons, banned by the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in the 70s, with those banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention, which didn't enter into force until 1997.  He also takes a gratuitous swipe at the US government, implying the US only "claimed" to stop producing biological agents.   And plague caused by "cosmic dust" !!!?  Finally, the last chapter, Aftermath, does not sum up the book.  Unsurprisingly, it rambles.  There is quite a bit about Richard II, and the last two pages are inexplicably devoted exclusively to Chaucer.  I wish I had back the money I paid for this book.  I wish more that I had back the several hours I spent reading it 
 robin trower has really lost a lot of his playing ability, same sound but no blazing licks and just a lot of trickery. two stars for the music and his new vocalist is quite good 
 We are currently using this book in my digital logic class and it is confusing.  All my class mates agree that this book is terrible and we get little out of it.  His explainations leave you saying ???What??? and there are no solutions to the odd numbered problems, a basic requirement for a text.  We are learning soley from the lectures and other students who have some experience with boolean algebra and truth tables.  The other reviewers that like his book must be friends of the author. If your college has chosen this text... Pray you have a good instructor!!! 
     What can you say about a book that introdouces three characters in one chapter? Or has a character thats entire vocabulary seems to consist of "Hotcha, Gotcha" and says that nearly 10 times a chapter. I would honestly not care if all the people upped and died. This book has no surprises but one, a "plot twist" that was obvious 6 chapters away. Did I mention I hate the annoying, underdeveloped, characters. Oh yes. I usually like Bruce Coville, but with this book, he has bought himself to a level of unreadability that is only outclassed by the sequel 
 As most writers grow older, their skills diminish.  So with Enter the  Milkman.  A lot of the book is padding - each character repeating the same  thing over and over again.  MacLeod's books are humorous mysteries and the  humor is there but the mystery is not that taxing.  Her earlier books are  masterpieces, so get this one to fill out the set 
 One of the worst MOS album I have ever purchased. Picked it up at the Virgin store by mistake, thought it was the Aussy import version (same cover design as last year but no gold color) but turns out, it was the US version. The tracks are less, the selection is poor, and the mixing was mediocre. My initial investment went straight down to the drain. It seems every MOS album that are targeted towards the U.S. market is always worse than the UK ones. If the 3 disc set UK version of The Annual 2004 is as bad as some reviewers said, then this one is a total trash worthy, in other words, worst of the worst. I am going to put it on eBay and hope I'll get some money back. I am not even going to make a MP3 copy of it, it's that bad. If you take your hard earned money seriously, don't spend it on this album. Or buy it at your own risk 
 Not much new here. You would be hardpressed to get any benefit from this book. It doesn't grab the atttention of the reader.   
 UGH! This book was awful - even for a summer beach read. I would not waste my time again on this book. Cute concept, cute characters, but zero plot. BORING! 
 I can't believe I went to the trouble! It's a half-ok novel if you see it by itself but as a sequel to Michel's story it's a no no. After all Michel gave closure withe her ending, nobody but her could and did bring this great story to an end 
 This book is filled with a lot of good information, but the problem I have is after carefully showing how messianic Judaism is really the brainchild and outgrowth of evangelical Christian attempts to convert Jews he throws up his hands and says that we should accept it as if it were a natural development of Judaism. It is not surprising that his views are soundly repudiated from all the branches in Judaism, including the Reform which he claims to be a member of 
 Although there are good poems in here, and good authors, Astley is intent on dumbing down poetry - this book aims for the lowest common denominator possible, and then  digs deeper. Astley's commentary and rants are opinionated and condescending. Poetry is far more alive and interesting than than this anthology suggests 
 This book, though very informative, is taken from so many other already available sources that it reads more like some student's book report. The  most inaccurate passage being that Jeff in "The Killer" wears  white gloves like Jeff in "Le Samourai". I own "The  Killer" and do not remember seeing him wearing gloves. Also,  Christopher Heard claims that some scenes from "The Killer" match  "Le Samourai" shot for shot. That is completely untrue. Obviously  Mr. Heard has not done his homework and thoroughly researched his subject  matter. All in all, it is an interesting read if you are unfamiliar from  where some of the material is plagerized 
 This is the first 3rd edition D&D supplement for the forgotten realms that isn't any good... the quality of the other products just didn't make it into this one and that is very disappointing.  This book is almost 200 pages but you wouldn't know it by paging through it, it just doesn't seem to have any real content.  Yeah, there's feats and magic items but oddly enough it lacks info on the Underdark itself, it's almost like the book tried to be too many things to too many people.  I tried hard to like this book but just couldn't do it.  I'm sorry to have to say I don't recommend anyone buying it 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 I have had trouble with both mini plug and RCA plugs. They are too large to use with my MP3 player and my receiver. They plug in part way and the connections are not tight enough to use. I think it is due to the large cable size 
 This is the story of Sheriff Bell, an insufferable dullard who won't shut up about how criminals these days are really evil (as opposed to all the lovely ones he knew of when growing up?).   He's also a world-class boaster, never going more than a few pages without telling us how fantastic is wife Loretta is. The same Loretta who spends most of her time baking for or writing to evil criminals -- which tells me all I need to know about that marriage.  The yakkity-yakking doesn't stop there. An even bigger gas-bag is Chigurh, the motor-mouthed murderer. In fact, he kills people twice. Before he shoots 'em, he bores 'em to death. His weapon of choice: Lectures about coins. (His final kill took so long, I had to restrain myself from flingling the book across the train carriage.)  On the technical front, McCarthy does not structure the drama in the Classical way. He chose the Boring way. The majority of scenes end exactly as you expect and only one character (Moss) has a believable goal. McCarthy also omits the obligatory final scene, between Chigurh and his prey Moss, which was the only reason I kept reading the book. No doubt this is to defy the expectations of the reader. Expectations that this might turn out to be a decent story, in my case.   What's more, Sheriff Bell has no scenes with either Chigurh or Moss, making him a narrator with zero personal stake in the action. Because McCarthy writes good, visual dialogue, he gets away with an inconsequntial narrator for the first half of the story. But when the man on the run (Moss) exits the story, there is no other character to invest in, so the plot grinds to a halt. McCarthy cannot resusitate it because there is no connection whatever between the two remaining main players.  So, does McCarthy put us out of our misery? No. Sheriff Bell waffles on for pages and pages about Vietnam, not unlike John Goodman's character Walter in the Big Lebowski. And that's it.  My verdict: I hope Loretta runs away with a criminal. Preferably one of them new evil ones 
 This was one of those I just wanted to finish.  Good thing because the author had a great story going then, all of a sudden, everything wrapped up nice and tidy in a paragraph. I never felt like I got to know the characters.  I was disappointed as I enjoy Christ-based authors and their characters.  This was not an interesting book 
 I liked the first album and I won't pretend to be an aficionado of this genre, but some things I have learned:  1) Don't rap with a touch of laryngitis 2) Maybe sing/rap with the beat and not just near it 3) Drop the "my life sucks" and "everyone hates me" tracks - whoops that is the entire album 4) I don't think the world can stand more than one rapped sad piano ballad 5) If every background singer has a better voice, perhaps your are done  Anyone want to buy a used CD 
 All I knew about MFK Fisher before reading this book was that she was a food writer.   This collection of essays portrays a self-absorbed, self-obsessed and self-indulgent silly woman of questionable character.  Since she is long-winded  and reveals sexual values likely considered loose during her time, it is only natural that she has been elevated to the faux status of fine American writer.   (I'm sure feminists love the fact that she walked out on her first husband, near as I can tell to avoid serving marshmallow salads to faculty wives, whom she apparently despised as beneath her intellectual superiority.)   I finished the book only because my contempt for the author kept me plodding through her essays.   This vain barfly thought she possessed divine insight, but I think it more likely that her insobriety prompted an abnormal amount of self-examination and reflection.   Her sentimental gushings reveal an egotistical, pompous, pretentious, shallow, and frivolous woman.   What astonished me is that she yammered on about suppers in France endlessly, but made only a passing reference to her second husband losing a leg and then his other three limbs prior to his death.   One would think this amount of tragedy and human suffering should command more discussion than a very good bowl of soup.  After reading the book, I read some bios of MFK Fisher's life, one of which mentioned her psychotherapist.  My insight into her personality proved accurate.   I'll think of her when I nuke TV dinners.  Celebrating life is not the same as celebrating oneself.   
 This book is outdated, outmoded, and nearly useless.  It contains tons of information on how to manipulate fabrics that aren't even in use anymore. Hardly anything on dealing with knit fabrics, which look better and are easier to manipulate. Ask anyone under 50 if they have ever seen any darts in their clothes? And all this slashing and turning and manipulating??? not only is it sloppy, its useless, Useless, USELESS! Lots of money spent for vague instructions on basic blocks, and only clothes made in the 80's. Save eyour money, just because this book is expensive, doesn't make it useful 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 I read this book after coming across it on a "most important books ever" list. I found it very hard to get through. Approximately half-way through the book I found myself counting down the pages until I finished it. This is not a book to read if you're looking to be entertained, however if you're looking for a good bit of culture/history I would think this would be a decent pick. Some of the passages involving the main character and his love interest are very well written and beautiful to read. In fact, I re-read some of the passages again just for the majestic quality of the author's writing. As a college junior with little knowledge of or interest in African culture I did not enjoy reading this book, however I may try again in the future to see if I can get more out of what others have deemed a very important and worthy novel 
 I read The New Money Masters after the Market Wizards and the New Market Wizards. When I saw "winning investment strategies of: Soros, Lynch, Rogers, etc etc on the front cover, I immediately bought it. Like any trader who jumps into the market without a plan or thorough study, I lost this trade. Train tried to portrait what's in those masters' minds but he failed. Even worse, his writing skill had been too bad for me to finish reading the whole book. Well, how am I supposed to expect something great from a 379 page book that carries 147 pages of appendix 
 Hard as it is to do, this film manages to make Jet Li look very, very bad. I kept having Karate Kid flashbacks! The story is the same old, same old, American martial arts move cliches, fighting for honor and all...in a place that is obviously NOT Los Angeles. The real disappointment is that the martial artists( in come cases obviously just local students for God sake!) are sub par and the choreography suffers for it. The action sequences are slow and awkward. Pass on this one guys 
 After reading 100+ pages, my knowledge of MBA programs and MBA practices has not increased at all.  This is a random collection of essays with little practical use.  This is not a "How-To" book or a "Cookbook" by any means.  This book is very light on practical advice, and I doubt that it would help anyone learn about MBAs.  Although it was written by people who have MBAs, their writing has almost nothing to do with getting an MBA yourself.  I was pretty disappointed with the quality of writing.  There are better MBA books out there 
 More Left Wing Liberal News media hate fest rhetoric based on rearrangement of the facts to suit the conclusion. Yes Bush led the country to war and yes Iraq is troublesome and problematic on many levels. But we are in fact at war with a determined enemy out to destroy our culture and make us all worship and worse yet act a certain way. And even worse yet writers like Mr. Rich are helping that come true. I definitley did agree with the authors conclusions and accusations. 
 If you are getting this for a child,think about it. Kids will probably watch it 1-5 times. Save your money and buy someone Monty Python,Quest for the Holy Grail. It is a show that you can watch 100 times. It will get  there minds off of Pokemon. You have probably all ready spent a lot money  on pokemon stuff. And they barely play with it 
 If you want to learn all about the two "offical" rocket organizations - the NAR and Tripoli, then this is definitely the book for you. A full 20% (at least) of the book is taken up in references, forms, rules, events,etc. of these two organizations.  Not only that, but it seemed like every second paragraph contains another reference to them.  This is not to take away the importance of these two fine organizations. They do a lot of good for the hobby of rockets and are involved in litigation to perserve our right to continue the sport.  Its just that one paragraph would have been sufficient to alert the reader that these organizations exist, and perhaps a reference to their web pages.  This is supposed to be a construction manual, not a propaganda vehicle for these organizations.   If you want to learn how to build a high powered rocket (without the motor), this book will at least give you a reasonable start.  If you are interested in designing your own rocket motor also (as I was) you will find nothing whatsoever in this book. No design, no formulii for fuel compositions, no nothing 
 If Mr. Alterman just watched a nightly news cast of CNN, which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality, then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web, tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality. Uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like McDonalds fast food, however those who know better, avoid it because it can be damaging to one's mental health, but then again Mr. Alterman just wrote this book for the money, even if he makes a fool of himself doing it 
 I have read all of the Artimis Fowl Books and loved them until now  I was disapointed with this one, and not found Artmis unusaly irritating, but felt the whole book was the lacking the charm and wit that had made the other three so good.   Truth be told I was younger when I read the first three, but still I can reread them and enjoy them (as I did after reading the fourth and being very disillusioned with the whole seris) so if you want my advice then I suggst you don't buy this book and let the magic of the first three live in peace 
 First, I loved the idea of this book--a compendum of the more significant mathematical breakthroughs in all their detail, as written by their creators. The text is refreshing in that it is not a watered down version of someone's results. I have a math background and all the details are appreciated. There's something about reading the original text, straight from the minds of these great men.  This book could be useful, for example, for someone who likes math and wants a 'sampler' of different areas of study. It could also be useful for someone reading up on the history of mathematics who wants to dig deeper into certain areas and see the original works.  All that said, I have to agree with another reviewer about the editing. It's awful (yes, awful) that such typographical errors could exist in a math book. The first section I looked at in this book, Riemann's original paper on the zeta function, had four typos ON THE SAME PAGE. This is disasterous to someone trying to learn the material for the first time, or someone trying to follow a tight line of argument. If this was a college text book, I'd probably burn it, because learning math is difficult enough, without having to contend with typos. To the editors of this book: COME ON GUYS, YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THIS. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED (YES, ASHAMED) OF YOURSELVES (you're just COPYING something someone else wrote--and yet you managed to mess that up)! At least put an errata page somewhere online 
 Dow Jones is still going through its major corrections after the roaring 80s and then the 90s. We are experiencing the same cylical phase that happened in the 70s - when war, energy crises, international market expansions, and demographic changes were gradually driving the economy to a malaise.  The main difference is that the country was in little debt 30 years ago. We are now owing other countries trillions of dollars, and the trade deficit will continue to soar. The economy may sink as a result, but it has nothing to do with bubble bursting. That was already done in the stock market years ago. Should the economy finally collapse, it will have to do with our structural economic problems.   Most probably prefer a soft-landing rather than a hard collapse. It will take some sacrifice and some political leadership to achieve a peaceful and endurable transition. It will be about our committment to paying down the debt, ending our oil dependence, and educating the workforce to take on the jobs of the new century that are not to be "outsourced" to other places.   As this review is being written, the alleged "greater bubble" has yet to be materialized. However, stocks will NOT emerge into a greater bubble unless the American people can become optimistic about the economy again. Dent has been wrong in his past predictions, so please do not take this book too seriously either 
 I did not like this book.  Lao is a VERY simple language, but this book uses a very complex approach 
 I came to this book wanting to believe, and leaning towards belief, but with plenty of skepticism. This book reinforced my skepticism. It is not intended as a defense of the visions, per se, but friendly non-skeptical interviews with the visionairies, and report of Marian messages to the Parish at Medjugorge, and a smattering of anecdotes of seemingly miraculous events. The interviews with the visionairies were most unsatisfying. The questions were leading and shallow, nothing like the kind of questions I wish I could ask. Even worse, the answers were stereotyped, vague, and even evasive. Was this a language barrier problem? An artifact of the interviews being condensed and edited? An effort to avoid arguments? Perhaps. But I kept comparing in my mind these transcripts with scriptural accounts of conversations with Jesus. Jesus, despite all language barriers and editing, was always very direct, clear, and substantive, and never shied away from stirring up controversy. Jesus also taught us to be on guard against the many false prophets who would surely come. I remain on guard 
 I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli 
    The entire book could have been distilled down to one or two useful pages.   A typical example of the author's predilection to stating the obvious in expert-speak:  "Generally children will send discernible non-verbal signals when they are ready to end a conversation with an adult. They often begin to stare off into space or become silly. It is time to end the exchange."      And then there are the self-promoting anecdotes such as, "It is encouraging to meet alumni from the 90's who had been exposed to intense social skill instruction during their high school years. Their conversational entrees are far more appropriate and effective: 'How are Mrs. Lavoie, Christian, Danny and Meggi?' 'How long will you be in the area?' 'How are things on Cape Cod?'"      If you can bring yourself to wade through the superfluous chit chat and you've never read anything on this subject before, it may be worth buying used 
 Wow, what a bore. The old stock footage is uneven and doesn't show enough of the truck. Other footage was taken on the fly when someone happened to have a camera on the street. The song is OK, but once that's over my son walks away. Why would a child who LOVES trucks walk away? Because some guy's voice (which sounds like it's in an echo chamber) comes on talking about a bunch of stuff he can't SEE on the screen. What's on the screen? More garbage stock footage. This looks and sounds like it was slapped together in someone's basement 
 You know the feeling...that feeling of "Oh my gosh, how did I ever spend money on this movie and when is it ever going to end?"  Well, that's what unfortunately accompanies this dull and somber film.   Unfortunately, because of its all-star cast, although this wouldn't be the first time in movie history where an all-star cast is wasted.  Aside from an interesting peek into the world of Yale's secret Skull and Bones society, a delightful cameo by Joe Pesci and a few too cute-by-half zingers, this movie has little or nothing to offer.  It doesn't keep one's attention and by the time you try to care enough about what is going on, you realize that you don't even care about the characters.  Matt Damon's skulking and scowling leading role lacks rhythm and chemistry, especially with the beautiful Angelina Jolie, and he is laughably miscast as a father.  In fairness however, with the script he's been given, it's hard to see how Damon could have done much better.  The pacing of the film is extradinarily slow and one can just imagine people walking out of the theater before it ends.  A huge disappoinment especially since director DeNiro is such a talented actor.  Skip it 
 I ordered this DVD not realizing it was not the Disney feature.  Since I had already opened the packaging I figured I'd check it out.  I found this to be a very basic, boring and not a very entertaining version of the timeless tale. The animation is dull and appears washed out.  The story lacks the adventure and excitement I felt necessary to entertain my young kids (even my six-year-old fell asleep).  If you're in the market for the Disney version of this movie be aware that this version is NOT DISNEY 
 Having been fascinated by this subject since my first visit to Dachau in the 60's I thought this book would be a compilation of the "best and the brightest" but I was very wrong. There are a couple decent sections written by some fairly good academics, but some of them, especially the chapter written by Barbara Green, are just plain ridiculous in their analysis and conclusions. Her conclusion that Stalin's murder of millions of Ukrainians was not "genocide" is just silly. Not only that, her reading list is very incomplete in that it did not include eye witness accounts of how systematic the death sentence of starvation was actually carried out. The chapter by Stannard which compares the settlement of the USA over several centuries in an era long gone with Hitler's attempted extermination of the Jews and Gypsies is ludicrous. While he may make some interesting arguments, he ignores the reality of the cultures existing in the "New World" where human sacrifice was rampant, slavery and war-making were the norm, long before the Europeans showed up. Not a word about that in his analysis. He also equates the massive deaths of Indians by infectious diseases brought to the new world with the deaths in the Nazi concentration camps, which would mean that the AIDS epidemic which started in Africa makes all Africans the biggest perpetrators of genocidal death in the history of mankind according to his logic.  While this book is one of hundreds on the topic, it is not one that is worth the investment of time or money if you are interested in the subject. 
 Buyer beware: this is no longer the same product. Maxell has recently changed their audio CDRs.  Formally, they were manufactured in Japan; now they are made in Taiwan. All the older Maxell discs would play in EVERYTHING. However, a large percentage of discs in this new CDR media are defective. The new discs will no longer play in my Panasonic boom box or in my Honda car stereo.  Worse, some of these CDs will fail to play in anything after a few days. 
 A dashing swashbuckler, Captain Alatriste, champions the cause of a young woman who has been forced into sexual slavery in a priest's home in the days of the Spanish Inquisition. At the heart of her trial is the issue of her heritage; she is of Hebrew descent. In the course of his struggle with the prejuidices holding not only an innocent girl captive, but a nation, the captain relives his own memories of the time he was a subject of the horrors and how afraid he was.   ** Though historically illuminating and shocking, the seesawing back and forth between memory and present narrative hampers the flow of the novel. However, if you have an interest in that period of history, this may not prove annoying to you. **   Amanda Killgor 
 Ummmm... I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the people who are killing other humans and eating their flesh, genius.  Depending on your point of view, the above line either makes or breaks this film.  Were the filmmakers really trying to use this most heinous, exploitative, misogynistic, nauseating piece of cinema trash as a morality tale or were they intentionally being ironic?  Or perhaps they were pointing the finger at the kind of people who who enjoy this revolting piece of supposed entertainment.  "Cannibal Holocaust" is the kind of film that is cheered by folks who have spent hours of their lives on the internet looking for snuff films and videos of rapes.  What this film gives you is the most realistic over the top, uncalled-for phony snuff film ever made. The film is so graphic and realistically shot that the filmmakers were charged with murder and had to produce the film's actors in a court of law to exhonerate themselves of the charges.  This is a powerful, incredibly well made and original film that certainly inspired the "Blair Witch Project", but while "Blair Witch" managed to terrify by not showing you anything and letting the storytelling do it's job, "Holocaust" has a silly story and shows you EVERYTHING: genital mutilation, gang rape, forced abortions, more internal organs than you'd think could fit inside the human body and, of course, cannibalism.  And let us not forget the very real animal torture the viewer is forced to endure.  One furry jungle creature (incorrectly dubbed a "muskrat" by one character) is held up to the camera and carved up, writhing and screaming in pain, with a knife.  In another instance which almost caused me to vomit, a very large turtle is dragged out of the river and hacked apart with a hatchet, internal organs jiggling like so much gelatin and limbs still kicking.  There's also a shot of a monkey getting his face chopped off with a machette.  The real kicker there is that they messed up the first take and had to get another monkey to redo the shot.  I should also add that none of these sequences advance the plot in any way, they are there just to be ghoulish.  That's where the irony comes in; you see the theme of the film is about the impossibly unethical and downright disgusting ends the film's documentarians go to to get sensational shots for their film.  One could easily make the same claim about the folks behind "Cannibal Holocaust" regarding these authentic animal mutilations that we are forced to sit through as we view this movie.  So again I wonder if, by deliberately attempting to make this film a morality tale about how humans dehumanize each other, they were being ironic and putting one over on the idiots who would take that line about who the real cannibals are as some deep philosophical commentary on our society.   If so, bravo.  But I doubt that's the truth; I'm of the opinion that it was a lame attempt by the purveyors of this garbage to justify a film that only exists to be so utterly disturbing and vile that only those looking for the most hardcore gore they could find would ever even attempt to watch it.  I love gore and horror as much as anybody (hence my viewing of the film), but this film is waaaay over the line for me and unless watching a newborn pulled from its mother's womb and thrown into a hole and buried as the mother's head is smashed in with rocks or a woman being violated with a disturbingly large piece of wood and then killed is your idea of must-see TV, I can't recommend you ever come near this film.         
 I can't stand this game after 5 minutes. The game is so unresponsive its not funny.  The first board I wanted to throw my remote. My friend watching asked me what the hell was going on. I seriosly didn't move the remote at all and my guy starts spinning around. At first I thought maybe the control calibration is wrong but then I was playing trauma center before and after Red steel and not once did i have a problem with the controls. Seriously the worst game i ever played 
 To quote from an extensive review in the Denver Jounal:  "This book must be used with caution because it pretends to describe what we now really know about archaeology and how it contradicts various biblical claims; however, it does so in a biased and non-objective manner. Contrary opinions in interpreting the new evidence are not discussed, much less given a fair hearing. The book is ideologically driven and should be treated that way by any one who reads it."  
 We own JD for kids vol 1 & 2 and love to watch them with our 3 YO son so this Christmas we gave him vol 3 & 4 and were very disappointed with both but especially vol 4. There is a large picture of a combine plus a cotton stripper on the front cover. Unfortunatly, neither appear in this video!! There is probably less than 5% of the DVD that is modern farm equipment. It is primarily about a two cylinder expo and a JD train/miniature farm scene. Neither of which I dislike but was just very disappointed that there was such a miniscule amount of modern farm equipment. The cover picture is misleading 
 The book covers the process of smoking well. Good information on brining, sausage making, and processing smoked foods is provided. It lacks fundamental data such as internal temperatures of smoke cook meats. A few  recipes are presented, but this is not a cookbook 
 I do not understand why certain critics who are acquaintances of Mr. Lambert's have described this as an affectionate book about actress Natalie Wood. It is not a sympathetic portrait of Miss Wood' in fact, Mr. Lambert blames her for the tragic events in her life when she's not alive to defend herself. He also goes out of his way to attack her mother and her sister in what seems to be a personal vendetta while at the same time falsely glorifying rv actor Robert Wagner, who he admits is a long time friend of his. There would be no need to remember Miss Wood in a book at this time had she not drowned under suspicious circumstances that Mr. Wagner obviously wishes to conceal. It is clear that Mr. Lambert's true loyalty is to Robert Wagner, not to Natalie Wood 
 Starts off with a good murder scene and then drifts off into erudite intellectual fluff and nonsense which causes the murder mystery plot to disappear like dew in Dante's inferno. Very disappointing 
 This album is seriously a joke.  It has to be a joke, because Beck's voice has no soul.  Yeah, it supposed to be funky, but adding ________ noises to a beat that already sounds ambysal is like mixing matches with gasoline.  It's not funky, it dosent have soul, and the album is a turd.  I haven't figured out if I like Beck instead. This album has no rythem and is a slapped together lego set that looks liek a piece of _____.  If you want real cool music, try Trout Mask Replica instead.  Guero was better.  I haven't tried anything else, although Paper Tigers didn't sound very promsiing.  Avoid this train wreck.  The song Broken Train represents everything this flaming turd is 
 The Summary (short version)  The characters...  Go to restaurants and drink.  Go to bars and drink.  Go home and drink.  Go to bullfights and drink.  Insult each other and drink.  P!ss and drink.  Go to sleep, wake up and drink.  Take baths and drink.  Have sex and drink.  I became an alcoholic just by reading The Sun Also Rises.  Summary (the long version) Several expatriates lick their emotional wounds and cavort around spending money left by their rich parents. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a reporter left impotent by a war wound. He and Uncle Toby from Tristram Shandy could have had a ball together (if you've read Tristram Shandy by Laurence Sterne, you'll get the joke). He's in love with the beautiful Brett Ashley, but his impotence makes it impossible for their relationship to have much substance. She falls in and out of love with other men while he stands around watching and feeling jealous. A little bullfighting and violence and drinking later, they're right back where they started: in limbo.  I've never cared for Ernest Hemingway's writing style. It's like he made sure you knew you were reading a story from a REAL man: very macho in tone and style.  And this coupled with the boringness of the story makes The Sun Also Rises a dreadful read 
 All I could think was, "Damn, if I had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge, I'd never be depressed." I don't know quite how to explain it, but I felt no empathy for him. I only ended up feeling more depressed. As a history of depression, the level of research was quite impressive.   If you read Prozac Nation and wanted to punch her out, steer clear of this one as well 
 Bill O'Reilly ought to stick to what he does best, i.e. making harrassing phone calls and bloviating like an argumentative loudmouth in a saloon 
 I had never read anything by Terry Brooks, so I thought I would try listening to Armageddon's Children because I thought the premise sounded interesting. I guess the story is interesting, but I found it extremely slow and boring. The narrator has a dreary boring voice that drove me crazy. I couldn't even finish listening to the whole thing because it became torture 
 Like many conspiracy books, the impact of Garrison's tome depends on the reader having little independent knowledge of the facts of the case.  In this case:  1. Garrison conceals problems with witness testimony.   2. Garrison recounts the testimony of witnesses who were discredited before the Shaw case came to trial, and who were never called to testify precisely because they lacked credibility. He apparently assumes (correctly, in many cases) that readers will not know that these witnesses were discredited.   3. Garrison takes witnesses who appeared rather late in the investigation and has them appear earlier so as to imply a sound basis for his suspicions about David Ferrie, arrest of Clay Shaw, etc.   4. Garrison makes excuses for the failure of his case, claiming sabotage by nefarious Federal authorities, journalists, and governors of states who supposedly refused to extradite witnesses he wanted. He would have had a case, he implies, if sinister forces had not impeded his prosecution.   5. Garrison inflates his own (and his staff's) investigative prowess. Ideas that were the result of crackpot inferences (Shaw as "Bertrand"), or dropped into Garrison's lap by buffs trying to help become the product of painstaking investigation.   6. Garrison conceals his own volatile character, painting himself as a model of self control.   7. Garrison paints a vivid picture of himself in the courtroom during the testimony of Clay Shaw and Charles Spiesel, and when the verdict was read, in spite of the fact that he was absent. Had he told the truth, readers would wonder why he was absent from the most important case he had ever brought.   People who want to believe Garrison doubtless will, but people who are at least a bit skeptical should check the following web page:  http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/jimlie.ht 
 I'd give it one star if it wasn't for the fact that I like JPI and value whatever real info I might have found here.  Unfortunately, you can't tell what is real and what isn't.  This is apparently a self-published rant that is poorly researched, horribly written, and excruciatingly edited.  And I am a faithful, liberal daughter of the church.  I would like nothing more than a great scholarly biography of JPI.  I read Yallop's "In God's Name" and wanted to learn more about JPI's life, teachings and his suspicious death.  You certainly can find good info in Gregoire's book, but you can't trust it, which is too bad.  This is no better than a lot of those tantrum websites you can find all day long for free, only without the animated graphics.    NOTE: It's important to note that I read the "black cover" edition, and have not read the newly revised 2006 edition (white cover).  I intend to do so 
 The unflattering picture of JFK on the cover of the original paperback edition of this book gives away the author's perspective.  The author tends to select anything he can find that is negative in order to demonize  Kennedy as a moral ingrate and ineffective leader. He also confuses a  sexual appetite with leadership abilities and qualities. One could place  judgement on Kennedy for these excesses, but then one would need to do the  same for a whole array of leaders who had trysts during their lives. If  there is any truth, it is perhaps that in the current climate of reporting,  Kennedy would have been exposed to the world. It is a question of how he  might have behaved knowing that the risks were immense. The writer truly  fails to give balance in this assassination- of-character biography. The  early biographies of Kennedy by his followers were homages to the fallen  leader but Reeves' biography does not have the balance or the intellectual  soundness of a comprehensive biography. We'll have to wait for a more  definitive biography by a respected historian who can give balance to the  talents, hubris and human frailties of John F. Kennedy.  This book is an  example of how NOT to write a biography. It deserves space on shelves with  Kitty Kelly's books and the horrible biography of John Lennon. It has the  same sort of National Enquirer approach even if with a long bibliography.  Reminds me of Calvin of Calvin and Hobbes showing his school report and  highlighting the nice plastic binder as a measure of value when the report  itself is far from brilliant 
 I loved the opening of the first chapter, and the metaphor about what we call ourselves being nothing more than a whirlpool in the river of life.  Great metaphor.  Love it.  The rest of the book seemed to me to be teaching (and Zen specifically has no teaching and is the destroyer of teachings) and emotions.  Beck's slant on Zen seems to me to be getting people to meditated for years (according to her it takes years) and work work work at it.  But Zen is not about that, it is about "nothing to attain and no one to attain it" period.  All this working at it that she recommends fosters a subtle sense of egoism, a belief that there is some goal to reach, something to gain.    Perhaps Beck is working with people whose lives are disasters and she is having to keep them busy in the hope that they will someday finally get it?? 
 This book proved to be disappointing. The author adores Kay Francis (perhaps too much), but he has no grasp of film history or the times in which she lived. The book is only about the actress and provides no details on what else was happening in Hollywood or the world. The illustrations are poor quality and also disappointing. It seems a rush job with little perspective or care for the final product 
 How can I put this in a nice way?  I've both written and read fan fiction that was better than this book. Now I'm not as passionate about Trek as some, and I don't have a favorite author(s).  However I've read enough paperbacks to discern a good book and not a good box.  And this isn't a good book and should have sunk with the ship that Diane Carey was supposedly on.    Spoilers from here on out for those whom don't want to know...  Star Trek: The Next Generation, Ship of the Line reads like a reunion movie of your favoriate television show.  One where ever cast member and guest star to ever have appeared is brought back and given some screen time.  And to add insult to injury it's just about as bad as those reunion movies are.  The book is supposed to tell the after episode adventure of Morgan Bateson, introduced to Next Gen in the episode "Cause and Effect" who's since then become something of a cult icon as captian of the USS Bozeman.    Now you'd expect being a Next Gen Trek book that captain Picard and company would factor in.  However, so many cast members are in this book that only Lt. Uhura and Lt. Checkov are absent - literally.  The characters appearing in this book vary badly in the way that they are written.  From Cheif Enginneer LaForge,  who appears as if he was a giddy and naive cadet, taking a back seat to Montgomery Scott.  To Counselor Troi and Dr. Crusher whom appear initially as if they were giddy school girls and ultimately as outraged gawkers if there were such a thing.    Captain Picard appears sullen and moody about the desctruction of the Enterprise D (granted), but sullen and moody to an extreme which is beyond norm.  Its as if he's facing a life altering moment all the while wanting to scream to him that a ship is a ship is a ship.  And what happened to the Enterprise D (if you've ever seen the Trek movie Generations) isn't even his fault!  It's like your favoriate first car.  Yeah it was your baby and it was totalled in an accident.  You're definetlly going to miss it.  But it's a car, a machine.  You can obtain a new one just as Captain Picard can be assigned a new ship.  Commander Riker isn't portrayed much better, but does appear to be genuienlly worried about his friend and captain.  Data, you'd wish would just turn off his damn emotion chip the way it makes him come across.  Captain Morgan Bateson is portrayed as ... I can only describe it as with a casual swagger unbecoming of a Star Fleet Captain.  Someone whom runs a very loose ship until he has to tighten up ranks for appearences.  Totally contray to the way in which he was portrayed in his breif cameo at the end of the episode "Cause and Effect."  Told by Picard and Riker, that he and his crew are in the future with no avenue of possible return and he all but collapses figuratively speaking.  But yet is portrayed as a captain as legendary as Kirk.  A true Starfleet captain wouldn't have to be told he had just passed through a temporal loop, he should already know before even steps foot on the Enterprise D.  The only characters to at all be anything like themselves throughout this book are Captain Kirk and Captain Spock.   We swing from as far back as the original series and all the way to the latest Next Gen movie at the time "First Contact."   Minus Captain Bateson's swagger in the way he runs his ship, we start this story with the USS Bozeman in deep space on the Federation frontier with the Klingon Empire near Starbase 12 at the height of tension between the two powers.  Good enough for the most part.  The Bozeman is described in error as a "cutter" but anyone whom knows Trek starship design can see that the Bozeman is based on the same hull as the Miranda/Avenger class frigate(s) and has a sizeable presence.  It definetly is not a cutter which are normally very small and minimunally crewed if Diane Carey the author knew her nautical terms.    After having rendevoued with Enterprise NCC 1701A, which immediately after transfering two crew members, departs for the staging area in advance of a Klingon task force moving towards the border.  The Bozeman is left in typical Trek fashion to luck into being the only ship that stands between Starbase 12 and the real threat, a Klingon vessel commanded by what we're told is Captain Bateson's longtime rival Klingon Commander Koraza.  Combat ensues as one would imagine before the Bozeman is cast adrift in the nebula/temporal loop that will bring it to the time of Next Gen.  The Enterprise 1701A ultimately doubles back and intercepts Koraza.  Nice appearence by the Enterprise A, and equally nice that Kirk and Spock make breif cameos as well.  But what should pick up in Next Gen times and continue as the rivally of Captain Bateson and Commander Koraza soon is swamped by countless appearences, bad writting, wasted pages of dialog and a lack of basic proofing by the author and/or the publisher.  As a previous reviewer touched on, the Bozeman is refered to as a museum piece having finally returned to Starbase 12 after being found by the Enterprise D.  A new Bozeman is refered to late in the book.  Unlike that reviewer, whom I respect, I can believe that a newly commissioned vessel could in fact be named in honor of the original ship,rather than the original ship almost a century old by Next Gen time refitted and put back into service.  But unlike the author Diane Carey I cannot believe that Star Fleet would just rename a vessel, which is frowned upon in nautical circles.  Pages are wasted with endless arguements between Bateson and Riker, negative group discussions between Picard and company over how he won't be taking command of the Enterprise E.  Captain Bateson, and whether or not he's qualified because of a quirk of senority that takes into account traveling from the past to the future and how many years you traveled.  Pages that could been spent on the larger story are wasted with a holographic Captain Kirk, from the original series now, with Captain Picard along for the ride on several historic missions in some kind of touch stone life altering decision type of moment for Captain Picard.  These pages should have been spent detailing and furthering the story of rivalry between Bateson and Koraza.  And basic lack of proofing in how the son of Klingon Commander Koraza is also refered to as the son of his second in command.  There are basic sentence structure errors, an occasional spelling mistake or two, and I kid you not, the name of a starship that Enterprise E under the command of Captain Bateson is supposed to rendevous with for war games changes from the Nora Andrews one page to the Nora Nicholas just a few pages later (and remains so through the rest of the book).  Like I've just written, Star Trek: The Next Generation - Ship of the Line should have been about the continuing rivaly between Bateson and Koraza.  This story could have been similiar to the Next Gen episode "The Wounded" with the USS Phoenix, which tells of the story about another starship captain and the Cardassians.  Switching things around, what could have been a real read of a story about a stoic and somewhat famous Starfleet captain and his rival a Klingon Commander unintenionally bringing both powers to the brink of war as they work against each other.  Having to be quickly and delicately interceeded upon by Captain Picard and the untested Enterprise E.    However what we get is overall several pages at the beginning of this story, a few in the middle and a few at the end.   Inter-mingled with pages of our previously mentioned holographic Captain Kirk.  Ironically the only character with which anytime is spent, however briefly, is Koraza whom were led to believe believes that he beat Captain Bateson, not knowing what had really happened, but whose plans for the destruction of Starbase 12 were ultimately quashed by Captain Kirk. Has since been living a life of dishonor with his crew on a survey ship.  Lastly to add insult to injury, as if just to give Captain Picard something to do it seems, that a Cardassian POW camp is thrown in. But the author fails to even hint at the Federation/Klingon/Romulan war against the Dominion.  And has the gall to write that Picard can travel to Cardassia at the height of war, and insist upon the return of prisioners.  To which Picards Cardassian torturer (see yet another Next Gen episode) calmly agrees to as if it were nothing.  This would be akin to General Norman Schwartzkophf(sp), simply going to to Baghdad during the first Gulf War in 1991, asking for the Iraqis to return their colation prisoners, and with little fan fare the Iraqis agreeing.  And lastly Koraza, a traidiontal Klingon, ultimately rolling over because he, figuratively speaking, see's the errors of his ways.    Ship of the Line Degnerates into a real mess of a novel.  Ramptant with so many things going on that nothing gets done. Seriously poor character portrayals and writing that a freshman in high school would be ashamed of.  Don't bother reading this book, because you'll be dissappointed like I was.  If you've recently purchased this book, then take it back and use your money for something else.  If you're just bent on reading this book, check it out from your local library like I did.  Then that way you won't feel bad when you see just how bad this story is, because you won't have actually paid for this book then.  KB 
 This book went great until page 18, when it switched into high-gear, Christian bible-thumping mode.  It goes as far as to say "...it's only when we go after those ideals from the foundation of Christian faith that our efforts will yield anything worth holding on to."  I have no problem with books geared towards Christians.  I DO, however, have a problem with devious marketing.  There are no idicators anywhere on the cover that this is anything but a guide to choosing a career.  Instead, it is just another tool designed to shove Christianity down unsuspecting throats.   
 This book is uniformly praised by ignorant people who want to believe the Warren Commission. Posner saw an opportunity to take their money, and he took it. Good for him. I'm sure if there was a sizable market of people wanting to believe OJ was innocent, he'd write that book too, with all sorts of convincing "scientific" evidence. Take a look at Weisberg's Case Open, if you can find it , for documentation of some of Posner's more amusing misrepresentations.   
 The SD slot stopped working last night - very frustrating. The compact flash card slot still works, though. I noticed a reviewer mentioned that it didn't work with their 4GB SD card. It did work with my Transcend 150x 4GB SD card. 
 Never recommend this book to anyone. Once again, it is only opinions of one couple. They have no bibliography, no other sources for their information. It is only a map of their experiences they have had. Tools are very basic and fundamental. "pop Psychology" Dont buy it 
 Maybe something got lost in translation but I think the wording and the sentences uttered by Ka and others seemed as if they were written by 5th graders.  I couldn't imagine people talking like this.  I forced myself to finish the book but the wording just "hurt my ears".  I read it based on the New York Times basically saying it was a great book.  This was not a great book, but maybe the translation was just bad??  Also, I am not sure if the author meant it or not but I got the impression from the writing and story that Turkish people aren't that bright.  It seemed to me he was putting down the muslim religion.  Anyway, that was minor, the writing was just bad, bad, bad. If you want to read stories that flow and wording that is like music to your ears (even though translated) read works by Naguib Mahfouz, especially The Cairo Trilogy. Now that is good stuff! 
 This doll is cute to look at... until you use it and it begins to grow mold on the material. I took extreme care with this doll and it still grew black spots on the material. My daughter loved having a baby doll in the bath, however, the shower part never stayed together and was just a frustration.   I have to replace this doll have only having her for a few months because of the black spots (mold). Maybe I'll try the water baby that got good reviews.  Very disappointed in the quality! 
 My wife got this book when homeschooling and my daughter picked out the motor experiment. We followed the directions but could not get the motor to work. After looking at the design I realized the armature winding was incorrect. The winding must go around the cork in parallel with the axis, not around the axis. Needless to say a child trying to build this would be extremely frustrated. I have a feeling the author did not build all the experiments. The lack of explanation of how the motor works is also a drawback 
 Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELL and THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MAN STANDING did little for me . . . add SPLIT SECOND, which I just heard, to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller about two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together to solve two campaign-trail crimes . . . I cared little about any of the characters, and there were far too many subplots floating around for my taste . . . the ending also didn't do much for me, as it brought too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly, I did not particularly "buy" the man behind the crimes; he just wasn't  all that believable. 
 The feature that originally sold me on the DSM-320 was its support for the XviD and DivX formats.  These, however, are the two formats that are supported the least, and a slow, jerky, framerate should be expected.  I at first thought it was a bandwidth issue, and proceeded to hard wire it to my computer using a crossover cable, the framerate improved, but not enough, in my opinion, for this device to even claim support for these file types.  If support for these two formats are the selling feature for you, be warned, you should look elsewhere 
 I really liked Death Cab until I bought this-yuck! If you enjoy a whole DVD of a band complaining about how hard it is to be on the road and singing the same songs every night-then go for it! They seem like a bunch of pretentious jerks-this did not help their image. I know its so tough touring the world playing the  music you love, but don't make a whole dvd devoted to your whining...yuck again 
 Please be aware that chain dialing is not supported in this phone. If you use a calling card for long distance calls, you will have to input the numbers MANUALLY.  There is no way to access them from the phones memory while making the call.  I had to return the phone.. 
 This monitor interferes with our cordless phones on all channels - a shrill noise emits when the phone rings or when you talk on it. ALso, it beeps out of range even when at distances much less than the stated 800 feet (- from our daughter's bedroom to the kitchen). I would definitely not recommend this product, and had I not lost the receipt, I would have returned it 
 Does the unit work??,...Well yes to a degree. It takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances. The display is poor and though they say "up to 40 objects per hole" there is normally 2-4 objects per hole. All this depends upon the Skycaddie course recorder. The user (you) can not modify the course or add any objects that the  course recorder didn't think was important. Now the bad part. The unit attaches via button and belt clip (like a cell phone). My button (part that attaches to main unit) has died twice in the first 30 days. When it breaks again,...which it will often,..the unit will probally hit the dirt. This isn't good. But fear not. It will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with Skygolf. And another week to get a replacement button (which has been modified even weaker than the original one). Now my replacement broke on the first time I clipped it to the belt. Now back to Skycaddie to get another. After being on hold for another hour, they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts. This will take another hour. You then get a message to leave a message. Normally within a week someone will call you back. By normally I mean about 35% of the time you leave messages they return them. Would I buy another,... duh,.... NO 
 I ordered two sets of BraBABY Bra Washing Holders.  When they arrived, there was no statement/invoice/receipt inside the box.  I used them today to wash three bras.  It was tricky to get the straps in the ball.  When the washing machine was on, I can hear the balls bouncing around in it.  When the wash was finished, and the bra straps were sticking out of the balls.  My bras have some satin on the edge.  The satin were all scratched up, probably from all that bouncing around.  I am very disappointed 
 With Perverse, Mike Edwards set out to prove that Jesus Jones was more than a `sunny, breezy pop band', what he ended up proving was that if they weren't no one was interested. Sad to say, but pop hooks were what people expected from JJ, and actually there are some here, but they are smothered by industrial/techno gook. Stick with DOUBT, that's where JJ peaked, even if some claimed they had `sold out'. Here they are pushing the boundaries, but that doesn't always make for a great listening experience 
 I've read five of the nine "Temperance Brennan" mysteries that Kathy Reichs has published, but this is my least favorite. I lost interest about two-thirds through. I felt the villains were not fleshed-out, the murder mystery too complicated and unlikely, the ending too neatly contrived, and the personal/romantic side story too awkward. This one was also too long, by about 50 pages. Reading it felt like eating a stew in which there were a multitude of ingredients, yet they did not blend into a successful flavor. The other four of her novels were fine. I love the TV series as well, although "Bones" allegedly shows Dr. Brennan much earlier in her career, with the supporting cast and the job duties and locations totally different than what is found in the books. In the TV series, "Dr. Brennan" has a steady cast of supporting characters who grabbed my mind and heart very quickly. In the books, her lesser characters all seem...lesser, indeed. Better luck next time out, Dr. Reichs 
 This product was a bad choice for me. It was a poorly done product. It was washed out, the quality, both audio and video was terrible. It was not enjoyable to watch. The packaging was cheap quality. I should have known better. Pay more and get a nice set, and a better product. Don't try and save a few dollars if you want something to enjoy. Paper sleeves make for a cheap copy. 
 I loved this movie, if only for Tommy Lee Jones and Tom Wood (don't know who that is? Don't worry, I'm the only one) and because it was a sequal to my most favourite of movies. But if you're not considering this movie because of your fantatical devotion to a single actor or series, then take your time deciding. The director was a first-timer, the plot is almost completely identical to the Fugitive (except...Tommy Lee Jones and Wesley Snipes aren't as cool together as Tommy and Harrison) and there are a fair number of awkwardly done 'funny bits'. I would rate it as an average cop drama, and a fairly underwhelming sequel. However, I loved it, but I suspect that my motives are a little different than most peoples'. 
 I read this book beacuse I wanted to learn about body language, to develop body-language awareness and to get across more convincingly. I have not learnt any of those aspects from this book. The author superficially describes different topics and does not provide any insight or meaningful discussion. Save time and money, try something else 
 I went to see this play at the Royal Court Theatre in London after having heard how good it was.  When I got out of the theatre, I felt like I had been called a horrible name by someone who didn't know me at all.  This play really seems to insinuate that men are all in some big club together and are all out to get women.  It is cheap and easy to put sexist dialogue in a man's mouth.  Lifetime does it all the time.  This is another silly play that portrays all women as courageous victims and all men as conflicted and brutal.  Gilman needs to put down the brush with which she paints such wide strokes and take a long look at something a little harder than racism or sexism.  Get real 
 Horrid. Just Horrid 
 There will always be the question of importance between sports and money.  Which is more important?  Do today's players participate because they love the game, or is it because they are thrown millions of dollars to play?  It is a question that will continue to be a part of our culture as long as million dollar contracts are signed.  I couldn't help but think of this concept as I watched this film.  In 1919 the players of a winning Chicago baseball team decided to throw in their chances of a World Series title just to earn some extra cash for their pockets.  The results of this game lead to interrogations, an appointment of a baseball commissioner, and a decree that would punish these ball players for the rest of their lives.  For those of us that were not around in 1919 to experience this event first hand, director John Sayles has decided to show us the events first hand through dry cinematography, horrific acting, and a drama that is lacking in ... well ... drama.  One of my favorite John Sayles films is Sunshine State.  In it, Sayles takes characters and gives them so much emotion and spirit that you are literally pulled off your couch and glued to the television for the entire two hours.  I wish this were the case for Eight Men Out.  Sadly, where this film lacks is confident actors and a intense and knowledgeable screenplay.  You could tell from the beginning that this topic was a passion of Sayles, but that he also had trouble directing it.  It didn't seem to move as smoothly as some of his other work.  I think one of the main reasons is due to the players that are under his lead.  These are not dramatic actors, but instead some of the "hottest" talent that 1988 had to offer.  I kept thinking that he was trying to compete with the 80s teen idols film that was released the same year called Young Guns.  He wanted to have a film that brought those normally not interested in a film of this kind into the theater.  Hey, it worked for me.  John Cusack is not a dramatic character, while later in his career he reaches this level, at this point in his life he is still has that persona of a imaginative teen.  This causes his "big" dramatic scenes to seem less and less relevant when they are presented.  Charlie Sheen's accent faded in and out throughout this entire film, while D.B. Sweeney couldn't shake the cliché ways of his character's lack of education.  Instead of being dramatic, I found myself full of laughter.  I needed stronger actors to pull this film from out of left field.  Finally, for those seeking a gritty drama about the hardships of "rigging" a game, do not look in this direction.  This is not an Oliver Stone film, this is John Sayles, which means that he is incapable of pushing any buttons.  There were so many directions and dark alleyways that he could have taken us with this film.  I wanted to know more about how these eight men won the trial, I wanted to know more about the confessions, I wanted to know more about the industry, but nothing was handed to me.  I just had to deal with ignorant characters that were about to get five years in prison for their crimes, and nobody was worried.  It infuriated me when the ball players walked into the courtroom and it was nothing but a joke and media frenzy.  It seemed like they didn't care about the trial at all, so which left me no choice but to not care either.  I dislike sports films immensely, and this film is one of the reasons why!  Grade:  * out of **** 
 i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective-like game.  unfortunately, this game is very kid-like.  here's an example.  the first non auto-generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy.  these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children's word game book.  i easily got all of them except 1, meaning i couldn't progress past this point.  no problem for me, because by this time i didn't want to!  i'm not saying it's a bad game, it's just probably not a good game for grownups. 
 I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.   For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.   Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.   The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.  However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.   In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now! 
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 The book begins by trying to link Jimmy Buffett with a sailor named Buffett who participated in the Mutiny on the Bounty.   It doesn't get much better. Buffett reveals more in songs and interviews than Mr. Eng was able  to dig up 
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 It gets the job done, but the sound is not even close to the quality of the actual iTrips.  I bought this cheaper transmitter after dropping my iTrip, and it's definitely worth the price.  There's also a faint high pitched sound for most of the play, when it's set to any station.  It works, but not as well as other similar products 
 Wow! What a treasure trove of ideas and patterns!  You will love this book 
 I received this product as a gift. It was broke within 4 hours of opening it. Someone was playing with it normally and the ball smashed the glass hard enough to crack it. This product should have been designed to handle abuse and it broke under normal stress 
 Back in the 1990s "Stone Cold" Steve Austin was the most popular wrestler in the WWF.  Also known as the "Texas Rattlesnake" he rose to superstardom following a series of stunning victories over rivals Jake "The Snake" Roberts and Bret Hart.  (He actually lost to Hart, but managed to win the title by breaking the rules of the match).  His career was marked by an ongoing feud with his boss, Vince MacMahon, who owned the WWF.  MacMahon complained constantly that Austin was too much of a rebel, and on numerous occasions he tried to thwart Austin by rigging matches or personally attacking him in the ring.  But Austin always got the better of him -- one time he punched him in the crotch, and another time he kidnapped him at gunpoint.  Austin's real name is Steven James Williams.  He and MacMahon cooked up the rebel character because they thought it would be popular with their viewers.  And it was.  Polls routinely showed that even children understood that the matches were scripted, but that they enjoyed the idea of a maverick character who rebelled against authority.  The fact that the authority and the rebel were part of the same machine didn't bother anybody 
 After her mother's mysterious death in India, Gemma Doyle is sent to a boarding school in England. Gemma is troubled by her mother's death and the strange visions that she is receiving. At Spence Academy, she feels like an outsider until her magical powers manifest themselves in the ability to travel to another realm. Things unravel as Gemma has to separate evil from good.  This book is written in as a first-person-present-tense narrative, which makes it very awkward to read. The point of a novel is to tell a story, not to think it. Besides--who thinks in coherent sentences? There are several inconsistencies in the writing tense which should have been caught by the editor.   The characters are at times inconsistent. They seem more like girls of the 21st century than the 19th. The girls can't seem to make up there minds whether to be 'blushing maidens' or not. One minute they are blushing at the mere mention of the word "chastity", and the next they are joking about sex over a bottle of whiskey. The general behavior of the characters would have been more realistic if the setting had been the 20th or 21st century rather than the late Victorian era.   A weak point with this book is the magic itself. The sources are never fully explained, and suddenly finding Gemma flying up a staircase was disorienting. The idea was good, but all explanations were vague and confusing.  The entire novel is inconsistent and sensationalized. I felt as if Ms. Bray had created this novel then thrown in some corsets and etiquette to create a sort of modern, Victorian-Gothic, melodrama. The overall effect is weak and unsatisfying.  
 I enjoyed the "Open Water", but this sequel fell flat.  It's really a shame, because the film makers had all the right elements in place to create a really good film.  The title should have been, "Open Water 2: Wasted Potential".  The characters were interesting until their IQs were reduced during the film.  The concept of the film was great:  6 people may die in spite of being able to touch their muli-million dollar yacht.  Safety is inches away, yet they cannot reach it.  Wow, that really had my interest.  Some reviewers said it was a good movie if you can just overlook the stupidity of the characters.  That is probably very true.  Unfortunately, I just couldn't do that.  Every time they had a chance, they did something stupid.  Often, all 6 let something stupid happen without even one speaking up.  I watched 100% of the film, just to see what happened, but I was completely disappointed with the film.  It wasn't terrible, just very weak 
 This book starts off with code errors in the first chapter. None of the code will compile. What a waste!!!! Stay away from this one!!!! 
 I'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face (same would go if I were reviewing The Fear of Flying or A Room of One's Own, both of which are far superior to this outing, although of different genres), but I'll go ahead and write one anyways. Nafisi's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in Tehran didn't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work. Nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students. I know I may get lambasted for saying so, but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion. Instead, we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general. The layers of interpretation for a character such as Humbert is simplified to either he's a villian or a misunderstood villian, neither of which deals with many of the nuances Nabakov has included. You would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students. The strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the West who comes back to Iran to teach. I think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context, yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave English professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country. On a more stylistic level, I was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text, as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them, actually become a massive blob without much indivuality. I had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another. Her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else, even though he does play an important role, although a subtle one in many scenes. I think I expected a lot from this novel that I couldn't get from picking up a newspaper and I didn't get much beyond that. 
 Stacey Richter's My Date With Satan reads like a lite sitcom version of Katherine Dunn's "Geek Love." The book's star "The Beauty Treatment" is an Emmy shoe-in 
 They would be very wonderful jewel cases except they must be very flimsy because more than half of them arrived broken

 My son received this as birthday present.  After one use we put in in the garbage can.  It simply does not work as shown.  Even after adding water to the paint as the directions state, the spinner would not spin once the paint was poured into the funnel.  We tried adding even more water and it still did not work.  Once the paint gets to the bottom of the tube, it slows the motor to the point that it barely spins.  The paint just runs out the bottom in a pile (if any even comes out)!  Save your money!! 
 Contrary to the title, I found the book more on the theoretical side. Lots of classifications with questionable practical value. The examples are high-level ending up with more classifications. Same observation about the simplistic figures. Chapter 13-The World Wide Web gives an introduction of the initial Web requirements, while Chapter 16-J2EE/EJB explains general ideas about EJB. My benchmark for an "solid" book, with somehow related topic, would be "Design Patterns" by Gamma,Helm,Johnson,Vlissides 
 OK, so where the heck is Vince Young, Matt Leinart, and Reggie Bush in this version?  You see Reggie Bush on the cover, so you think you're going to get the opportunity to play with the Heisman Trophy winner, pair him up with Lendale White and Matt Leinart, and take on the Longhorns to try and replay the Rose Bowl.  But none of these players are to be found.  In fact, Ohio State is listed as the #1 team.  Am I behind the times?  Or is this how EA Sports does their football games?  Do I need to buy NCAA 06 in order to use these players in their prime?  I was hoping to be able to play them with updated "abilities" that would reflect all of their outstanding years in 2005.  Any ideas out there?  Is this a code or a "cheat" I need to unlock?  HELP!! 
 I have always loved books by Debbie Macomber, but this one is the exception.  It seemed forced and disjointed--would not recommend at all...maybe this series should come to an end 
 This is basically a 1/8" male to RCA cable for $73; you could get the same exact cable for $5.99 at Radio Shack.  Yeah you get a dock and power brick too but price it out; not worth it.  Buy the cable at RS; it'll work EXACTLY the same.. don't be fooled.  If you want the dock and power brick buy them seperately; you'll save major $$$.. 
 It is a shame that American film classics ( like L and H)  get more attention and love outside of the US than in it. I just bought the Universal Laurel and Hardy 21 Volume Box set which is only available in Europe from Amazon UK (region 2). This set is EVERYTHING people are saying it is. It is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films ( some solo efferts) and goes though the Hal Roach Features. All the prints are restored and of pristine quality. A truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys. There are some missing films ( I assume for copyright reasons) such as Babes in Toyland, The Devils Brother, Bonnie Scotland and Flying Deuces.   To acomadate these DVDs I bought a region free DVD player off Amazon,which is the only way to go if you really want to collect. The DVD player was very cheap. plays beautfully and  is well worth the investment. As a side note if you have a region free player all the DVDs in the Universal Box set are also availble as single dics, in case you don't want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films. If you love Laurel and Hardy this is the only way to go! Anything to screw Hallmark and the corperate monster!! Why did they buy these great films just to sit on them and distribute half-A prints!!!  
 I was very disappointed by this novel. Roth is a talented writer, and I had hoped that he would be able to create a truly compelling novel out of such a promising idea. However, the novel just didn't work for me. The characters felt something like cardboard cut outs and seemed inconsistent in their behavior. The plot spun out of control and became completely fantastic and quite unbelievable. Read something else by Roth - I think you'll enjoy one of his earlier works more than this 
 My boss asked me to get this, so that he check out the Latin portion of it.  What a waste!  The only Latin on this CD is *Latin* American Spanish.  The interface was underwhelming. I needed to guess at what did what, because the controls are mostly icons. What's worse, there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program.   Apparently though, the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back.  If you are learning the differences between US and UK English, its there!  I gave this one star, only because I couldn't give it no stars 
 I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable.  After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq.  However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.  Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction?  As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, "the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong," which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility.  You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction 
 I also ordered the Errol Le Cain and got the Jane Ray version!  What is the deal?  Why is this happening 
 new york city used to be cool, yeah.  if i'd gotten this album when it came out i might be saying the same thing about sonic youth!!  then i might not have looked into murray st. and sonic nurse.  i, um, showed up a little late so instead of toyning me off to the band it just sort of collects dust on the shelf.  oh well 
 I have some Surrender Cinema stuff and they are really good softcore. But, this DVD is not. It's completely censored, if you buy it, you're gonna miss all the good parts. It lasts only 70+min when it's supposed to last 90. Don't buy this unless you get a really uncut version 
 Disney keeps goming out with sequels to the best DVD's ever made.The  Jungle Book Limited Issue Is the best movie ever made.My Grandson watches it all the time. Its made for  the child also the adult like me. I bought  Jungle Book 2 totally dissapointed in the dvd.  I did not like it at all I returned it.Its a horible movie for children:  Disney stop ruining our excellent dvds.I give this dvd A - 
 I purchased this item in December 2005 but didn't use it until July 2006.  The wires broke on my first use.  I thought about requesting a replacement from KitchenAid but have decided instead to ask for a refund.  This item is a total waste of time and money 
 First off, the graphic novel is and will be better than a movie, novelization, play, interpretative dance, or whatever other form you want to put it in. Why? Because graphic novels/comics are a medium which cannot duplicated. As a reader you are much more actively involved in the story than passively watching a movie. With the page in your hand you may stare at it as long as you like, flip it upside down, flip back to a page previous, or any other number of things us crazy folks do who read these wonderful masterpieces of our time.   To correct the person who, incorrectly, pointed to the artist of this work (Mr. David Lloyd) as disapproving of the film, it was not the artist who protested it's creation, it was the author, Mr. Alan Moore. Just as he has with the other hideously molested adaptations of his work (From Hell, Leauge of Extraordinary Gentleman) he did not want to have anything to with this million dollar money trap. He has several reasons which you may find out by simply searching for any number of interviews with him, but basically he does not approve of this and all other big budget, no substance movies that are produced solely for the purpose of extorting money from   parents through their children, while offering no real meaning or substance other than an orgy of explosions and bastardizations of once meaningful tales. He gives his portion of the proceeds to the artists involved.  Also in the correction department, this series began in 1982 and was published until 1985 in the UK's Warrior magazine, alongside other great works such as Marvelman (originally being in black and white). Upon the success of Moore in the mid to late eighties, with such work as Watchmen and his revitalization of the Swamp Thing series, DC decided to 'resurrect' V and thus Moore and Lloyd continued the series to its conclusion.   If you want to experience V for Vendetta the way it was meant to be, go to your local comic shop and pick up a copy of the trade, you won't be disappointed (unless you're a mindless idiot who eats up whatever bs movie comes down the pike for whatever mindless reason, in that case there's no hope anyway, how'd you even get to this webpage??).    "Hello the Voice of Fate and V for Vendetta. 
 I bought the happy co electric head tripper for my husband for Christmas. He has wanted ones that we've seen in the mall, so this seem to be a good one.  Well, the plastic pieces that fit into the slot were very flemsy. We had to be careful not to snap it trying to get it in. Once we got it in, the head tripper felt great.  It really did send goosebumps down my spine.  THe only problem is the purple plastic piece broke off, litterally the next day after giving it to him. It first was bent and then finally broke all the way off. I do not recommend this product. I was thinking of getting the ting ting motorized head massager to replace them. You can still use the happy head tripper it is just one tong short 
 Anyone who argues that the infamous "band" An Angle is not a blatant ripoff of Bright Eyes is clinically insane. The person that argues "sImPLE PLAnnn and GoOd ChArloTTE sound the same OMGGZ that proves that bright eyes and an angle can sound the same and thats perfectley oK!!1111": are you seriously comparing those "bands" as being worthy of even being discussed in this conversation? Of course there will be bands that sound similar to them. Simple Plan is mainstream crap made for 13 year olds. As for bright eyes and elliott smith?! Are you serious? Do you listen to elliott smith? If you did, you'd know the song structures, sound of his voice, etc is entirely different from bright eyes. But not to drag on, "flicker of a cigarette", "did you, did you, did you", "like a locket like a necklace...". It is simply impossible for all of this to be a coincidence, as well as the sound of his voice (he's from Sacramento for god's sake, stop faking a Nebraskan accent), and the artwork. I hope this is a joke and if it is, I will just laugh along with whoever made it, because they did a damn good job. 
 I ordered the camera case for the Canon Digital Elph 450. And I was given a completely different one. Prices sound great, but they do not deliver what you buy. Had a bad experience with them. 
 What I'm about to say may be conflicting, but I believe this from what I've seen.  Although that reconciliation was much needed in previous years, it has become something else today.  Rather than reconciliation between blacks, whites, and all races, it seems that today it is more about pronouncing who you are and what race you're from, making yourself seem a little more ambitious than you'd like. Coming from a Mexican cultured background, racial issues arise only when, well, racial issues are brought up.  People need to realize that true unity won't happen until we stop looking at people by a certain race.  This book tries to emphasize the importance of keeping close to your culture and how strange it is to integrate to another, when in reality it's not as strange as it really is. Marrying people from other national backgrounds is not bad; congregating with other churches of different backgrounds is not bad either; black and white Christians can live together.  We don't really need proof.  It's not as relevant as it once was 
 This is a thoughtful book with lots of useful information on intuition.  The problem is that the print is so tiny, and I, being over 50 y.o., get eye strain trying to read it without a magnifying lens.  There are also  many typos, misspellings, misplaced commas, incomplete sentences, wrong  grammar, etc., that it reads more like an unedited first draft than a  finished product.  The material is worthwhile but I wish it could be  presented in a less physically painful format.  Clearly, the publisher did  not "already know what to do" with this text.  If it were more  readable, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars 
 I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know 
 Simply put, this book is terrible.  It's advertised as "hard sci fi" but the ideas, not even to mention the story or characters, just aren't there.  The characters are all paper cutouts and the storyline drags very badly.  I kept checking the page number and thinking, "Is it possible I've read this many pages and still feel like the interesting part hasn't started yet?"  Worst of all, the "hard sci fi" consists of a Jovian gas-based society (which has been done much better by other authors) and nanotech machines, the Wheelers, which they simply *skip* actually describing in detail in the book!  By the end I felt scammed by the marketing of this book.  If you are looking for hard sci fi, do yourself a favor and buy anything by Vernor Vinge, Ian Banks, Greg Egan, or any of the many other authors writing much better works in this genre 
 I suppose as a very general overview it might be useful. Third Reich Militaria is a very vast field. A detailed handbook would probably be more like the Oxford English Dictionary than a 'handbook.' Still, much of the information about values seems somewhat outdated based on my research. I guess overall it's not a bad book, just FAR too small to be very useful to a collecter. You will definately need other material to supplement this book, no question. 
 I just bought this from Amazon and have had it a day.  Everything seemed great, it sounded great with all my sources, and it even looked good doing it.  Then I tried to play a CD on my second room "B" speakers.  What?  Where's the sound.  Everything is hooked up correctly.   Sounds comes out of the A speakers for the CD.  Sound comes out of both when I have the FM Tuner playing.  What gives?  I finally go back to the manual and after much searching see that, by design, the "B" speakers will only play analog sources and my CD is connected digitally.  How stupid is that?  People with digital connections aren't supposed to have secondary sets of speakers?  Back it goes, I suppose 
 I found this book to be annoyingly simplistic.  The illustrations - full color photographs - are nice enough but the text leaves a lot to be desired.    For example, the book gives three steps for sewing in a zipper, which might be enough if they told you whether to use thread or yarn for the backstitching into place (the picture seems to show them using yarn but it's not really clear), whether or not to remove the backstitching (the picture of the finished garment appears to show the (rather sloppy)backstitching still in place.  The third step is to slip stitch the edge of the zipper into place...again, no mention of whether to use the yarn or matching thread, though it would appear to be embroidery floss.  Kitchenering is shown briefly (and not explained very well) but is called "Grafting by Sewing," so a newcomer to knitting wouldn't know what to look for in this book when confronted with the term "Kitchener" in a pattern and, alternatively, when faced with the term "Kitchener" in a pattern wouldn't know that this was the method they might have seen in this book called "Grafting by Sewing."  I'm sure there are better books on finishing techniques than this one 
 If you really like J.D. Salinger, please don't read this book. It's just depressing. Frankly I don't doubt the truth of it, but do I really want to know what a nasty self centered oaf he can be? No I don't 
 This book is garbage. Filler to make money. A travesty. All the others were awesome to OK. But, let's face it - Get on with it! I'm not really interested in +++pages of Matt traveling with the circus, or Elayne's torment becoming Queen, or Egwene's mishaps with other Aes Sedai. I want some ACTION. What's going on in the AshAman (sp?)'s heads- I mean, how cool would that be since the Taint is gone? I'm sick of this. But I'll still read the rest, who knows how much time I've already spent. SURELY IT MUST BE OVER SOON. Not even Tolkien could go on this long. Wrap it up 
 Very complicated book. Bad examples and format. AN FYI for college students trying to save money, the older edition is the SAME as the newest one. What a rip off. 
 Tras escuchar el Frankenstein de disco que hizo Fey ("La Fuerza Del Destino") y al caersele la bombachita al ver las ventas de ese aborto tecnologico, Ana decidio no quedarse atras y sacar su propia version de sus propios exitos cuando estaba con Mecano ( y la guita entraba y entraba al banco...que dias aquellos, che!) para ensenarle una leccion al maniqui ese. Parecia buena idea hasta que se le metio por la cabeza dar el toque final al escoger ( al sex-coger quizas?) a caligula de la industria fonografica... el terrible enfant (Y chaparrito lo es!) Aleks Syntek, cuyo unico disco rescatable ya fue ("Noche En La Ciudad", 2001). Ambos enfrentando un futuro incierto ya que las rentas en euros son caras y mantener la trocka en las calles de DF es un reto para cualquiera, pero mas para el armando manzanero este, se arriesgaron a crear este monstruo. Shakira saco un disco unplugged en el cual masacro sin piedad todos sus exitos al cambiarle los arreglos y cantarlos de una forma que los hizo irreconocibles e inaguantables. Esta mina que necesita un polvo urgentisimo (el chapulin colorado lo hubiese hecho mejor que Syntek) termino con lo ue le quedaba de fans que no les queda otra ahora, que volcarse a las operas y cantatas de los hermanos cano. Quizas haya joyas ocultas en esas obras. Se ha confirmado que Ana y Aleks han hecho todo lo posible para que este disco, aun con sus buenos temas, sean inescuchables, como los discos de Cibo Matto. Terminaran copias de este disco de adorno en la pared de algun boliche de cuarta cuando a las 4 de la manana a algun borracho se le ocurra mirarse en el reflejo despues de haberse mandado un tema de vicente fernandez en la maquina del karaoke, y lo que vera no sera bonito, ni su reflejo ni este disco 
 Pretty much boils down to the idea that (American) Catholics who stay "in" the church, do so "because they like being Catholic".   Which apparently means they like the familiar "American Catholic" culture or ethnicity (ethnicities: Irish, German, Polish) that they were born and raised in: the rituals, color, music, customs ("May crownings"). The vernacular language change they accept as good, the Vatican, medieval ethics and theology they ignore (and have been for decades.) Greeley himself comes from ethnic/cultural Catholicism with good music and colorful liturgies and customs, so he's got a good "born Catholic" culture to like.   But there's little here in this compendium/rehash of Greeley's previous writings to lead someone not born into one of those likeable traditions to turn to Catholicism, or of help to anyone who converted because of the attraction of Catholic theology and the Vatican II vision of Church despite the poverty and disfunction of a local Irish Catholic culture of minimal liturgical beauty (concentration on "validity" as good enough) and little or awful music and zero spiritual content. Or who now find themselves stuck in a parish with all the same (updated with awful music) and now overlaid with a return of authoritarian top down heavy handed management from the Vatican and local bishops, the rollback of the Vatican reforms, and the crackdowns on the least signs of life in intellectual life, particularly in Catholic institutions.  What was the "Revolution"? It is when Catholics openly decided not to "receive" (i.e. ratify with "religious assent") fiats from the hierarchy that they found unreasonable, unworkable, and out of touch with reality. The hierarchy still hasn't gotten the message that if the Church (the faithful) doesn't "receive" a teaching (i.e. the believers don't believe it), it can't reflect the "sense of the faithful" no matter how the Vatican invokes infallibility of either the ordinary or papal magisterium. The Vatican doesn't get it that they're function should be to express what the believers who are the Church believe, not tell them what they should believe based on some theoretical neo-scholastic theology and 13th century concepts that ignore everything humanity has learned about itself since.  Greeley's Catholics who stay because they like being Catholic are the ones the Revolution worked for because they've got a compatible or likeable Catholic cultural milieu to fit into. Those who don't, have little reason to stay 
 A generation before there was a Left Behind, there was The Late Great Planet Earth by Hal Lindsey and C. C. Carlson. This is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of America. A phemomenal best seller, it was a watershed event in the growing Christian publishing industry. For many Christians, their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future. A generation later, many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of Holy Scripture, sensationalistic attempts to correspond Biblical prophecies to current events, and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated.  So why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism? Well, while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events, it still resounds for much of the Church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by Lindsey and other "prophecy pundits." While it is certainly true that Tim LaHaye has replaced Lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism, it cannot be denied that Left Behind was made possible by this book.  Part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form. For LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, it was the pulp novel. Back in 1970, Lindsay and C. C. Carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose. Like most books of this type (e.g., The Bermuda Triangle, Chariots of the Gods?, The Philadelphia Experiment, The Population Bomb), it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts. Like most of these books, it was a peculiar period piece of American life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams. Like most of these books, it is laughable in retrospect.  If the book were out of circulation and I were reviewing this for historical purposes, I would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp. The original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong. After all, it was the 1970's when wild conspiracy theories, distrust of any traditional authority, and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage. When viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age, a UFO invasion, a famine around the corner, and California falling into the Pacific Ocean, the authors' claims of the coming Armageddon look downright trendy.  However, in the intervening years, the revisions of this book just kept piling up. Make a bad prediction? No problem, edit the book with the old gaffes removed, add a few trendier predictions, and release it as a new book. Lindsey, now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years, still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis (Carleton's contribution is more stylistic) despite his failed scenarios. Lindsey's original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s (he even wrote a book The 1980's: Countdown to Armageddon trumpeting this belief). Well that didn't pan out, so he then jumped on the Y2K bandwagon (another of his books was Planet Earth 2000 A.D.: Will Mankind Survive?). Oops, wrong again. First communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is Islam (a more recent book is The Everlasting Hatred: The Roots of Jihad). When one bogeyman falls, he is quick to insert a new one in its place.  Between the failed predictions, the hilarious misreadings of the original languages, the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology, and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the Biblical prophecies "right before our eyes", it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things. This trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the Left Behind series of novels.  If you can find a copy of the original version from 1970, it can be interesting in much the same way as a Brady Bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time. Just as many Catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the Baltimore Catechism, fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie A Thief in the Night.  However, for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy, it is best to pass. For all its success as a cultural marker, its usefulness in properly understanding Biblical prophecy is basically nil. For this, its original purpose, The Late Great Planet Earth is completely worthless.  
 im sure the book is fine for those of us who can read.  My 5 and 6 year old children(and myself) prefer the hidden picture books that show the pictures that need to be found, not in words, but actual pictures.  thanks, am 
 It may work fine for those who use ps2, but using usb it frequently locks up. I have my laptop and desktop plugged in, but if I unplug the laptop. I have to shut everything down, unplugg the kvm and start over. What a total pai 
 If you spend a good deal of your time doing OCR on books skip this program. It is even slower than the previous version (which was tortoise-like) still screws up the order of columns, is very bad at reading mixed numbers and letters, Takes forever to move through long documents, and just genreally makes you feel like you are back to using a 486 when you are working on a pentium 4. Oh, and don't be fooled by the claim that it can actually create fillable forms. It will take you less time to create it from scratch in Word than to scan it in and then fix all the errors. I'm switching to Kurzweil 
 I was searching for a book regarding high-rise concrete construction and settled on this one.  As I suspected, the information in this book does not represent how things are done in the US market. (NOTE: Bamboo scaffolding on page 305 and shirtless/shoeless workers on page 213). The portion of the 417 page book related to concrete frame construction is only 20 pages.  The book is not entirely useless but covers all topics only very briefly 
 I ordered this from Amazon and they sent me the wrong book.  I returned the other and requested the correct one.  They could not provide it and instead offered me a partial refund.. 
 I had never heard of this author before and picked this book on cd up at the library. It moved at a snails pace, the book jacket made it sound like an inriuging mystery - but more time is spent on analyzing every last detail amongst the characters - finally when something does happen by the 8th cd - its anticlimactic. And althought he main character continually talks about being psychic - she never once has a premonition, other than feeling "spiderwebs" when she walks in a room.  I couldn't wait for this book to end, and I will probably never pick up another book by this author, even though other reviewers say she writes good books. I kept wondering if it would be better, if someone who was not monotone was doing the reading on the cd. That didn't help matters. 
 I am from Australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to Amazon. Is a complete season of Baywatch really Baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly, the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing? I don't think so.  Not only have the distributors done fans no favours but Amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast. On the Amazon website as part of advertising for Season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it. If you go by the cast that Amazon have put on, you would think that it WAS the real original Season 1, when we know it is not.  The release in the UK, which is out now and the upcoming release in Australia on March 14th is the real deal. Season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct. There are NO episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact. Might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal.  AARO 
 Undoubtedly the worst 'Best Of' DVD ever made, even if someone gives this DVD as a gift you should punch that person in the face...after watching this DVD I felt like burning down the company that made this DVD . If you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this DVD to him as a gift.   There might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror, but it can't be for the actual DVD. There aren't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds. Shame on the band for putting this out. Obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a 'Best Of' on DVD.    This item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture. My taped videos on VHS from MTV and VH1 sound and look better than these ones, really. This essay in amatuerism may have some interest.   For worse, is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90's to 2000. 'Love Is Blindness', 'Walk On', 'Elevation' and several alternative videos were edited out. Didn't they have another filmed version of 'Gone'?. Mexico City 1997 was just a below average performance. Shame on U2 for keep going with 'Gone' from that bad shaped Bono's rough night. I still dont understand why we must to keep watching the same footage for a particular song. Im talking about 'Until The End Of The World'. In case you dont know, THERES an actual video clip from that song. Rather, they just put the well known Sidney 1993 version here.  Rumors say they're going to release a DVD Boxset by late this year. I really don't want 'remastered' versions of shows we've been watching for even 22 years. Rather, I'm fond of watching previously unreleased footage.   Just in case, here's a list of several unreleased PRO-SHOT filmed concerts from early 80's to Pop Mart Tour (I didn't include Elevation because there're 2 DVD's out there from the same Tour). Cheers   1- Belfast 23-01-1981 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  2- Berlin 04-11-1981 (Great Goncert)  3- New York 22-11-1981 (Good Concert)  4- Hattem 14-05-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  5- Roskilde 02-07-1982 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  6- Devore 03-05-1983 (Great Concert)  7- St. Goarshausen 20-08-1983 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  8- Dortmund 21-11-1984 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  9- Montreal 27-03-1985 (Great Concert)  10-Los Angeles 18-11-1987 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  11-Dublin 31-12-1989 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  12-Stockholm 11-06-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  13-Washington 16-08-1992 (Great Concert)  14-Anaheim 14-11-1992 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  15-Dublin 28-08-1993 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  16-Adelaide 16-11-1993 (Great Concert)  17-Rotterdam 18-07-1997 (AWESOME CONCERT!)  18-Sao Baulo 31-01-1998 (Great Concert)  19-Santiago 11-02-1998 (AWESOME CONCERT!)   What the hell are U2 waiting for?         
 No compilation will ever live up to the original...the original was the best rap CD ever produced IMHO.  If you think you'll like this CD because you just want to listen to a different flavor of the original tracks then it may be worthwhile to check out.  Otherwise, there is absolutely no comparison.  The original has straight genuine attitude which stamped it as one of the best albums in music history.  This one tries.. 
 After enjoying the first novel in this series I was really looking forward to this sequel.  It started out pretty well but soon went downhill.  The plot is barely believable and the "woe is me" and handwringing gets old.  I don't think I'll even bother with the third book - wish I hadn't already bought it 
 Not good for beginners.  Not good for anyone actually.  I'm a professor at a college.  This is the textbook for the clas.  I'm whipping out the Syd ZField book 
 This is a good GUY flic, nothing special, but fun for gamblers and football fans. The whole thing is kind of a self-hype, true story. The gambling predictor as ladies man and hero, puffed up and glamorized, but the fantasy is the thing for young men. Gambling, chicks, and swell clothes is what it's all about.  Shallow, no 
 I am so disappointed in this book, I am returning it. My primary reason? The authors keep mentioning 100 trigger foods that the ALCAT tests for, yet they never provide this list. Why not? Because this book is simply a marketing vehicle to get people to order the test through their lab. 
 Anyone hoping to gain an objective insight into the complex tragedy of the GLF should avoid this book at all costs.  Despite the author's reputation as a noted scholar in the field, he makes sweeping, generalized claims that  are simply not documented.  In discussing the negative aspects of the GLF,  for example, all efforts are made to present Mao as not  responsible--somehow separated from the policy-making process and therefore  not responsible for the terrible consequences.  The millions of deaths that  resulted are acknowledged, but the author quickly points out that Mao did  inspire millions of workers in China to work for the common good, as if  this somehow compensated for the maniacal toll on the country.  I don't  know why Mr. Macfarquhar is such an apologist for Mao, but it clearly  interferes with the balance of his analysis and would outrage any sensible  student of Chinese history 
 Well, I was really prepared for something special.  Not!  This is a book for Cityfolk.  Those of us from the Heartland know how to do these things or have a pretty good idea and know where to go to learn.  There was nothing special for me 
 Everthing about this movie was bad.  The Acting, the story, the revenge of the nerds like characters and humor.  The acting and production value was so bad that you'd think it was a home made movie with somebody using a home camera from 1975.  How much did it cost them to film this movie?  50 bucks?  The Revenge of the Nerds like script has been done to death and has never been funny to begin with 
 Social neuroscience is an exciting and important topic of study.  This book does it a disservice.  This book is poorly organized and presents only brief summary of many fascinating ideas.  You might find something that interests you, but you're unlikely to find it in enough detail to get a clear understanding of it.  Honestly I expected better from Daniel Goleman and I was quite disappointed by this book.  Unfortunately I don't yet have a better book to recommend instead 
 The author ought to stick to romance novels 
 I originally read the novel (of which I assume most of the other reviewers are unaware) and watched the earlier German film of the same name for a college course entitled "Memory and Mourning in Post-War Germany."  I'd just like to point out that the film is a horrible depiction of the novel. It seems that the director wanted to make a more "Hollywood" version of the film, and I think he succeeded. For instance, the entire ending is completely different from that of the novel, and in my opinion is completely wrong for the story.  In general, the film has little to do with any of the original versions, and is far inferior 
 What a lovely book this is, full of happy blond children lavishly photographed amidst charmingly rustic settings. However, the knitwear they're modeling, although clean-lined and attractive, isn't "Celtic" at all. Yes, there is one Aran-ish tunic in the collection, but unless you are a thirteen-year-old, it won't fit you. A terrific disappointment 
 This very small book is a quick, quite superficial overview of the Saudi royals -- material better covered in Murawiec's 'Princes of Darkness' and in Schwartz's 'Two faces of Islam' among other options. It is, for example, surprisingly generic and non-specific when alleging human rights violations,corruption, etc.    In addition, it is not particularly well written, or perhaps not well-edited -- occasionally one can get away with starting a sentence 'And...' but not constantly. Reads like a college term paper more than a professional work, at times.   I also have to say - having read more than a dozen books on aspects of the Middle East, I am still waiting for one author of Arab heritage to be anything other than virulently, belligerently anti-Israel. Jewish and Israeli authors seem to bend over backwards to give at least some small nod to the Arab, Muslim, or Palestinian point of view, even if they then try to discredit it. The shrill polemics of even educated,  'Westernized'  Arabs inevitably casts doubt on their other observations. Although it is a very small note in this book, it was there in the usual strident neon. 
 Read the Unbox terms of use CAREFULLY before choosing this route over a regular DVD purchase.  It is not your usual set of "blah blah" legal jargon.  For example, 3c: "Removal of Software. If you uninstall or otherwise remove the Software, your ability to view all Digital Content you have downloaded to the Authorized Device will immediately and automatically terminate and we reserve the right to delete all Digital Content from that Authorized Device without notice to you."  If you ever remove the Unbox software, Amazon may revoke your ability to view the Firefly episodes you paid for and may even delete them from your machine!  Amazon, I've ordered literally thousands of dollars of stuff through you and always had a great experience; why did you let Unbox create these anti-customer terms of use?? 
 The authors explanations on the concept of opportunity cost of capital of an investment, a central concept of standard finance, are so sloppy and confusing, starting from the first pages of their book, that one wonders if they clearly understand themselves the simple probabilistic model underlying standard finance. The fundamental fact of finance, which states that between two securities with the same expected future value investors will pay more for that with lesser variability, is barely mentioned after about 200 pages in the legend to a figure. It is presented as inescapably logical, which it is not. In short this book gives a long and somewhat stuffy presentation of conventional finance but will be very difficult to a reader that really wants to understand finance 
 Though these are the songs that make the Mills Brothers famous, they are not the original recordings that made these songs famous, and not necessarily sung by the same men that sang the originals (certainly they are considerably older).  These are OK, but they lack the punch and familiarity (to a fan like myself) of the originals.  The title, though not actually misleading, leads one to believe you will be listening to the original songs--they are not.  I recommend only if you must have the complete set of mills Brothers records 
 I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked.  And yes, I know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but I kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. And what did I find? NOTHING. Oh, what a waste. It's like Sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like.  If it hadn't been for my HRR (Home Reading Report) I wouldn't have finished reading this at all.  I guess I'm saying this because I'm not into this genre. Love stories are fine but this one... nah 
 Stop right now.  Do NOT buy this.  Buy the actual book instead!  I know, I know, crazy idea in this day and age, but Cliffs Notes are exactly what is wrong with the world of literature these days: too many people reading the Reader's Digest version, and not enough actually reading great literature!  I mean, come on people, the book is less than 200 pages long.  You can read it in one sitting.  And it's not even that difficult to understand--the prose is limpid and the plot engrossing.  Don't cheat; don't take the easy way out.  Do the right thing.  Read the book, not the Cliffs Notes 
 Sorry I bought this book....it wasn't anything that I could follow thru on...guess I'll just stick to watching my 'over active fork'....T 
      This novel could have been a long short story or a novella. One event takes place in the story and Perez-Reverte milks it for all he can. There are plenty of  historical  persons such as poets, playwrights, and painters thrown it. This is basically a one episode tale. I rate this a B-. 
 I knew the author as a younger man ...has morphed into an amalgam of Dr. Ruth and Dr. Phil.  Death of a close relative effects people in profound ways, yet personalities are mostly immutable. Ann Arbor is a granola city, but please. I found the prose stilted and the examples right in line with the general tendency of people in the helping professions to generalize their advice to the masses to sell books.  Waste of time!! 
   This book is anything but a source of information on REAL magick....Bonewits (whose name is appropriate)....claims to be a Druid AND a Wiccan....Although wicca has taken a lot from druidism, They are not the same... and you can`t be both. Mr. Bonewits is nothing more than a hippie/ yuppie environmentalist...ie, a college puke, who, like nicholls, and gar gomm, invented Neo-paganism as a new movement just to put themselves at the forefront of it....If you go to this mans website, you will see that he will do, or say, or SELL anything to make a buck. Beware!   True druids will know this to be true 
 Don't Study this book if you are trying to pass the PMP Certification Exam.  This book is out of date.  Be sure to buy a PMP Examp Prep book that was written for the PMBOK 3rd Edition 
 This is an impossible diet--unless you are a King and Queen or a famous person who can afford all the proceedures listed in the book (lies).  I believe lipo is cheeper than doing this diet 
 the book is really boring, its like an interminable speec 
 I'll state the obvious. Rich Boy's southern twang is so thick that its hard to understand what he is saying sometimes. This album has more bad tracks than good tracks so let me focus on the good then the bad. Standout Tracks: Throw Some Ds is a catchy first single that I didnt like at first and the remix with Andre 3000(he had the best verse on here), Nelly, Murphy Lee, The Game is a lot better than the original. Boy Looka Here is an alright second single plus I like how the beat breaks down. And I Love You had potential to be a great track till Pastor Troy delivers a crappy verse on it but Big Boi held it down on here. Lost Girls and Ghetto Rich(featuring John Legend) are two tracks that are worth hearing plus any song of substance I'll give credit for. Filler: Rich Boy pulls a Rick Ross and has way too many chick songs on here like What It Do, Good Things, Touch That A**(the worst out of all of them) and On The Regular. Role Models is weak and so is the fillerific Hustla Balla Gangsta Mack and Gangsta. Get To Poppin has to be the worst plus I've heard Pitbull spit over that same horrible beat(and that track sucked too). Bottom Line: 6 good songs are a good enough reason to skip this album. Yeah it might have some catchy cuts but the album is packed to the rim with skip material. 
 This movie was rather dissapointing to me. If you like action anime movies then steer clear of this one, it doesn't have too much action, except towards the end. The animation is also rather lacking and is rather  outdated, for instance, lots of time when one character is moving and  talking the rest of the screen is completely stil 
 "Col Mike Martin" raised in Iraq, speaks fluent arabic.........  The Taliban are Pashtoon, they are not arabs, they don't speak arabic, they don't even like arabs very much. They are a totaly closed tribal society. I spent a year living and working with the Pashtoon in 2005 in Helmand Province. There are no members of the Taliban who are not Pashtoon. The other ethnic groups in Afghanistan, the Tajik and the Hazara, are opposed to the Taliban.  Mike Martin would not have the correct family, clan and tribal ties and background to carry this off.  Sorry, but Forsythe has dropped the ball on this one. 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 Mack 10 seems to have lost it.  Like Ice Cube with War and Peace, he tries to sound hard with an edge but you can tell he's trying too hard.  He seems to have lost his hunger along with Ice Cube after the Westside Connection album.  This is probably 10's worst album has he continues to fall.  WC's the only hope for the old Westside Connection.  Mack 10's gangsta believability is very very questionable after putting out a pretty lousy album here 
 I recently purchaced this book and returned it.  I attempted to study for the test by brushing up on the history.  Yes history!  Well, it was nonexistant in this book.  It was just a big fat tip book for scoring a 5 on the AP exam 
 		Although the premise of this book is brilliant, perceptive and absolutely vital to the next few years;  Reich sadly presents an incisive example of the economic thinking and progress that made Democrats relevant in the 1930s.  	It's years ahead of the Bush ideologues, who act and think as if the 20th Century never happened.  Reich is progressive enough to adopt the policies of the 1930s, and he does exceptionally well.  He knows how to blow an eloquent "toot" on the whistle of a charming old steam locomotive;  like many other politicians of nostalgia, he thinks it gives him the right to fly the Space Shuttle.  	The world is changing.  As an example, Wal-Mart can forecast with 5 percent accuracy how many copies of a new video disc it will sell, and it has that figure within four hours of the disc going on sale.  That's where the brains of Wal-Mart is located, and it's why the company needs only $10-an-hour clerks for the check-out counter and to stuff the shelves.  	When check-out counters were complicated, it made sense to hire $20-an-hour clerks.  Now the job involves holding a bar code in front of a laser scanner, it has become another job where many companies could use "los barratos illegales".  	No one has a "right" to a specific job;  work must be earned by those who acquire the necessary skills.  Fifty years ago, it made sense that American auto workers were the best paid in the world, their assembly work required skill.  Today, truly skilled jobs are done by robots;  assembly workers do low skill work that is too menial to be automated.  	Success today depends on the desire to learn technical and personal skills needed for a specific job. Sadly, too many people have VW "Bug" skills and Escalade attitudes.  Sorry, life isn't like that any more.  	Let's do some numbers:  there are about 190 million Americans in the labour force, plus 10 million unemployed;  at least 10 million illegal aliens have jobs here.  If Reich is right, then how can millions of illegal migrants with about a Grade 3 formal education get jobs that Americans with high school diplomas can't hold?  Instead, every illegal migrant with a job is another proof that Reich is outdated.  	Reich completely ignores this issue;  instead, he offers Depression-era solutions for the future knowledge economy.  There's a good business reason why there are millions of illegal migrants in America, and why no administration will take action against them.  Reich, as a former Secretary of Labour, should address that issue.  	The future is ahead.  Americans deserve a better than going back to the 1930s with Reich's liberal allies,  or back to the 1890s with Bush's conservatives of greed, cronyism, graft and war.  This book shows Reich would have been a great Labour secretary for Franklin Roosevelt, but he was merely a seat warmer in the 1990s.  	Please, we're all going to live in the future.  So, let's think about the future, instead of resurrecting colorful but antiquated policies of the past.  Reich should do much better, or else we'll all be Bushwhacked by the sultans of greedy-nomics.  
 This book is written for someone with a 6th grade education and no more. It talks about magamps for pete's sake. It dosen't even broach the subject of transistors. NO TRANSISTOR THEORY!! What in sakes is electronics if not transistors! The stupid objectives at the beginning of each chapter, and the even worst review problems at the end of each chapter are simply a waste of pages. I am a former nuke electrician from the navy and a current IC Fabrication Technician in the semiconductor industry. I purchased the book to just stay up on my studies, but this book fell way short. My fiancee's daughter has learned almost everything that is covered in this book, and she is only in the 7th grade. Be forewarned, a bad book indeed 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it pains me to say that is was terrible.  I am mystified why the author chose to call the book Charlotte because after JA's portion, Charlotte is rarely mentioned.  The rest of the story is a collection of rambling, tedious speeches by minor characters.  The story becomes ridiculous when the author introduces piracy and horse racing into Sandition.  It ends with the inevitable, but unbelievable uniting of Charlotte to Sidney.  It is unbelievable because they have barely had 2 or 3 superficial conversations in all of the author's addition to JA's fragment.  Don't waste your time on this one, check out Sandition instead 
 I was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because I felt like a traitor when I didn't like this book.  I wanted to like it, I really did - but it was very dull.  I ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.  The first chapter started out with a bang and I was totally hooked.  It didn't take long to lose me.  Boooooring.  I didn't like Sophie, I didn't like Royd (Royd - are you kidding?  Perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  I wasn't interested in the direction the book went.    I thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  If Sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  She was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.  Royd was so very unlikeable I couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  Ick.  Adding Jane into the book was very contrived.  Plain old artist Jane and her cop stepfather Joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  It seemed like a ploy to connect Eve Duncan with this book.  Not at all believable.  The one sentence that I found interesting was when Michael thought that Jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  It seemed to be a lead in to the next book.  The first IJ book I ever read was Ugly Duckling.  Hopefully IJ re-reads that one before starting the next one.  Give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...].   
 I have one very similar to this, same design, material, just a different brand.  It's dangerous to use it to crack crab shells as it is nearly impossible to keep a firm grip on the smooth surface.  Also the jaws aren't designed to really clamp around anything and the teeth are rounded and useless.  Since the handles are also so short, it is not possible to really gain any leverage 
 My girlfriend had this CD and played it for me.  I really like country music and I like some of Reba's music for this CD was way too "far out" for me!!  Some reviews here have mentioned that its too loud and overdone.  I have to agree.  I don't think much of the songs on this collection.  If you're going to buy a Reba CD I would buy her first greatest hits collection.  That's a good example of country music without Reba overdoing the vowels and syllables to her words.  Give me a break!! 
 The problem with this game starts with the introductury movie... it develops slowly, goes on forever, suffers from disconnected animation and does little to set up the ridiculous premise for game play.   Once game play FINALLY does start, my child found the games boring and the TRANSITIONS between the games tediously slow.  Cute characters...zero edutainment.  It was consigned to the dustbin by the end of the day 
 I'm very disappointed with this gift basket. The contents that I received were far less than as pictured and described in the web page. The price of $85.90 is very expensive for this item and definitely not worth it. I ordered 4 items from Wine Country Gift Baskets totalling over $230 and had to return all items due to unsatisfactory products/contents. I spent almost $30 in shipping charges which they refused to reimburse me. I would never order or recommend Wine Country Gift Basket to anyone 
 He doesn't deserve that Nobel.... It was a political decision 
 This book was too heavy on its goody-goody message - that magical ancient objects put in the hands of ordinary people can lead them to greatness. Made me almost feel like "Gee, I guess I won't really make it unless I find a weird old piece of bronze."  The characters were incredibly one-dimensional - even when they got a hold of the "things." I thought I was reading LaHaye and Jenkins until I looked on the flyleaf and saw that Andy Andrews is a motivational speaker - then it made sense. I am totally non-suceptible to motivational speakers - sorry but I think it's all corn.   Don't get me wrong - I have read some inspirational work that I thought was great - Gloria J. Gibson, for example, but this? Not for me.   If you love "Reader's Digest" you might love this. If you are a bit jaded and an anti-Pollynanna, you might not care for it. 
 I have bought a few books by Denise Austin and I thought this one would be a greta idea, but I didn't really like it. The first portion of the book before you reach the 21 days is great information, but the meal plans did not seem very appetizing to me. She says that you need to stick to her exact routine for it to work and it just did not fit into my life and it has been sitting on the book shelf ever since 
 If this is the generation I am supposed to belong to, I want to disown it.  Ben Stiller's directorial debut centers on four friends recently graduated from collage, and are now trying to find their way in the world.  The movies messege is that we are a lost generation, but that is not are parent's fault (where this movie tries to lay the blame).  The kids in this movie are just lazy, more or less.  And they spend their free time trying to make meaning out of their lives.  Indeed, Troy (Ethan Hawke) even tries to ratinalize stealing a candy bar by saying society ows him.  Winona Ryder plays waify Lelina, who makes a documentry out of recorded footage she has of her friends.  One day she meets Michael (Ben Stiller) who is their age but has made a good career out of the TV industry.  Ethan hates him for his honest approach to life, and so the battle for Lelina's love begins.  I really wasn't too impressed with this movie, it just made it seem like my peers are just wallowing in self pity for the sake of being the cool, tortured artist; when they should get off the couch and go get a job 
 I am a huge Jane Green fan and was very disappointed with this novel.  The story had interesting possibilities, but also left a bitter taste in my mouth.  The thing I found the most disturbing is that every man in the book was a remarkable cad...even Amber's "devoted" husband.  Call me naive, but not every man that is attracted to another woman other than his wife is going to act on that attraction.  Also, the story seemed to drag and then ended abruptly.  Doesn't even compare with The Other Woman 
 It's just that simple.  There is NO credible clinical evidence that chelation therapists do anything for patients except lighten their bank accounts.  If any chelation therapist wants to sue me for writing this, BRING IT ON!  
 As with other books edited or affiliated with Jean Smith, there seems to be confusion as to how many days there are in the year.  This book says there's 365, while another of Smith's collections about Buddhism says there's 366.  In fact, both books only have 356 entries.  This type of glaringly obvious mistake is representative of the lack of depth and detailed consideration given to the content of this book.  I would look elsewhere for "wisdom" if I were you.  I wasted another fifteen bucks on this one 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 Will the real Ronald Reagan please stand up?  Will the author of this biography please sit down?  What happened when I read this book?  Did I learn more about Ronald Reagan and the people around him?  Yes.  Could I tell what was real and what was invented?  No.  Did I stay up late trying to finish it?  No... getting through this book took awhile.  It was not an easy read.  I had heard this was a "unique" biography, written from the perspective of the author as a fictional character (!), and it seemed that way.  I understand historical fiction, and I understand biography.  I guess I am having some difficulty with melding the two, particularly with Reagan, who WAS larger than life.  I wanted to learn more about the man and his presidency, and I was left hanging.  Another biography will eventually come out.  How long can you wait 
 I was quite disappointed with this one.  First of all the book's ending is very grim.  I agree with another reviewer when they said they'd rather be left imagining what kind of messes Arthur and Ford were getting themselves into now.  And so many unanswered questions!  What happened to Fenchurch and why didn't Arthur care more about what happened to her?  What happened to Zaphod?  Colin the robot?  What is the question to the answer 42?  What was Fenchurch's idea that would solve the world's problems?  What was the point to the people on Rupert?  It's worth reading just to be able to finish off the series and because it's still well written and funny just like the others.  But be prepared to be disappointed by the loose ends and finale.  
 The Sivulkas' work is a rather long narrative of American advertising -- with very little to offer beyond reproductions of some rather commonplace ads from the last two hundred years.  Much of the information they offer seems to come from other sources, and there is no real bibliography to the book. It is most misleadingly titled "cultural history" since there is so very little to the book beyond a chronology, and that is full of mistakes, over-simplifications, and such bland statements that there is nothing to be learned from this book. Others have written much better and more meaningful  things about the history of advertising, and charged less than [$$] for it 
 I don't get all the rave reviews here.  I've owned this CD since it came out in 1997 and its been probably more than 5 years since I had a desire to listen to it.  Now listening to it trying to figure out what I want to put on my I-pod and I really can't find anything other than the 1st 2 tracks, which are great.  The Filter/Crystal Method track is a classic.  But beyond that I just find the songs somewhere between mildly interesting and boring.  I am a fan of many of the rock & electronic artists here, but this experiment just didn't pan out in my opinion.  It's been 10 years and I haven't seen any other collections like this so I must not be in the minority.  Nice try, but there is not much more here beyond the concept 
 This small book has a load of recommendations on the back cover. Yet, I find it unsatisfactory. It meanders in and out of the history of Islam and the Middle East, but loses focus on the way. Subjects are touch upon by conclusion and generalisation, but not really in depth. It is obvious, however, that Lewis knows quite a lot - but still some clear mistakes (or misformulations?) in chronology and factual events mar the picture, and damages the feeling of trust to how the subjects are handled. It has some really interesting insights in how the USA became the great enemy of the Islamists, and many details that makes the Middle East history much more detailed than it usually appears. Yet, in walking there and there, it lacks the solid foundation on facts and events present in the books of Serge Trifkovic, for example. And while Trifkovic writes with determination and feeling for the importance of facing the Islamist threat, Lewis merely mentions the threat, but then walks on to something else. And he doesn't really connect the issues of Holy War and Unholy Terror in depth as promised in the subtitle.  Bottom line: While interesting, I suggest to spend time and money on better books. They are out there 
 This CD is (just about) what it claims to be: the best performing songs (on the charts) from the band Chicago between 1982-1989. Only 1 chart hit from that period of time is missing, though it's a fairly sizable one (#10 charter "You're not Alone" from 1989). Since "If She Would Have Been Faithful" only hit #17, that tune should have been cut if this were a question of making it fit on LP. (Vinyl was still the predominant format at that point, so that may have been why there aren't 13 cuts here.) I'll take off a star for that.  It also gets docked a point for including the "album cut" version of "Hard to Say I'm Sorry". Hits collections collect radio hits...and "Get Away" was NOT the radio hit version. I have the old 45 of "Hard to Say.." and it trails off with a synthesizer fade...PERIOD.  The next point comes for sheer lack of variety. Granted, this does what a greatest hits collection has to do and Chicago just didn't bother to single much material with any semblance of tempo or edge in the 80s. That fact doesn't make this collection any more listenable as a whole, though. It's nearly an hour of non-threatening ballads with "Along Comes a Woman" and "Stay the Night" the only real respites. (There would have been 3 if "You're Not Alone" made the cut..)  The only cuts really worth saving from the era are "Hard to Say I'm Sorry" and "Love me Tomorrow". The rest are all rather bland.  BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking at this, you already know you LOVE mushy ballads and I'm not going to change your mind with this review anyway. If that's the case, all but "You're Not Alone" are here from the 80s. However, their best material remains the early to mid 70s when they were still flexing some jazz influence and horn charts. The ballads then were less formulaic, not drowned in strings and synths, and they functioned more as a band instead of "singer plus backing music". If you want their best material on 1CD, you need "Chicago 9-Greatest Hits" (ASIN B0000021RP).   If you're that rare bird who loves jazz-pop AND synth-ballad Chicago, the 2CD set from Rhino (ASIN B000068ZVQ) gives you the whole enchilada 
 I believe Ayn Rand's writings are very destructive. And this isn't because of her highly un-original philosophy. No, the reason for this is the powerful grip the books has on her followers. In her books they find  justification for behaving in a anti-social manner that is slowly  destroying the fabric of the societies of the Western World. This egoism is  supposedly derived from "reason". In the real world however there  is no reason for people not to find fulfillment and meaning from helping  others and caring for their family and friends. The accusation that  "altruism", i.e. decency and goodness, leads to tyranny is  nothing but products of a very paranoid mind. The craziest thing about this  though is the fact that Ayn Rand has been raised to a saint-like status by  her followers. No disagreement with her writings is ever accepted and if  you disagree you are an evil communist/collectivist. To be a true  individualist you must agree with everything she has ever written. Isn't  this collectivism in a true sense? No, says her followers, those views are  derived by reason and must therefore be share by all intelligent human  beings. Pretty scary!! Note that Objectivism, like Marxism, Freudianism and  Jungianism, is a closed system of thought in the sense that any critisism  of the system is automatically seen as a symptom of unreason. This is what  makes Objectivism a religion rather than a philosophy or scientific method.  And this is also the reason for the fanatical behavior of her disciples 
 I am a huge fan of the CARS from day one. I tried to like this but can't I was ready to hit the concert too. I just can't. (Easton busted his collar bone so tour cancelled)Yeah Easton is an excellent guitar player. Hawkes too great keyboards. But missing the other 3 guys it just isn't the CARS. The vocals no less. They can be a cover band but no more. Ben Orr had a voice that can not be copied. God rest his soul. Ric is an excellent songwriter. The band was formed by Ocasek and ORR. When Ben died it really was the end. The thought that these guys would even try is very sad. It is like seeing the Beach Boys today. They are not what they once were. 
 Even though I have never heard of this author, I bought the book because it looked interesting enough.  However, this book was not worth the discounted price that I paid for it.  Clearly the author is working on the side of the racist crackpots out there and is not looking at the reality of the border situation.  He seems to have spent some time with the fringe border vigilante-militia types and has obviously sided with them.  We need a serious book about the border situation as is today and unfortunately this one isn't it 
 This book is basically a compilation of different things, most of them pretty useless. In particular, all the mathematical part is in view of the recent developments of network theory, totally obsolete. It seems a better investment to buy a network theory book or a "real" sociology book 
 this cd sucks this band sucks i agree with uber guy they are generic, no let me take that back their super generic i know generic come on i listen to breaking benjamin their generic but not as generic as pulse ultra and another thing the guys voice is to whiny. he need to quit crying when he sings good examples of this are the bands that didnt get hug enough so they sings songs about my girlfriend left,i hate myparents and so on and so forth. i could keep going but i would like to go to sleep so the short and the long of it they suck and bands like them suck buy the good stuff 
 I read chic-lit, a lot. I found myself truly disappointed in this book. What a waste of time! 
 I was appalled at this book, I grew up on a ranch close to the one she writes about.  Her facts about ranch life are mostly untrue and I believe she was on a vindictive rout of the people on this ranch.  I do understand that she has since retracted much of the book, but after she took all her 15 minutes of fame.  What has happened to her. I was furious so see such a blantant piece of writing get so much play.  There are such good books about ranch life she should never again create any piece of writing and expect the public to be so duped 
 This book may be good for those who have not at least already tried using positive affirmations in their life, but other than that, that is basically what most of this book stresses, other than categorizing you into a certain type of animal such as a hedgehog or a turtle, etc.  Some case histories and positive affirmations, but much more would be needed for someone with true anxiety and depression.  
 This book is one goofy rumor after another.  With hardly any verifiable sources, Epstein goes crazy throwing out every possible conspiracy idea around.  He actually states that Hammer financed Al Gore's college education, and that the whole Gore family were his servants.  If you love the "X Files" you will love this book 
 What a great way to sell books! Tell the people what they want to hear.   Do not mistake this book for a dispassionate science book. This is a political book, masquerading as science. If you read this and you find yourself agreeing and feeling strongly, ask yourself why. The answer is probably that you are looking for a rationalization of what you already believe.  This is science like prostitution is love. It may be a feel-good facsimile, but it isn't the real thing. And turning to politically motivated science cheapens the politics as well as the science.  I think the most breathtaking aspect of this work is the colossal hypocrisy employed here. Micheals and Balling decry the distortions of the left-wing environmentalist nutballs and play up the limitations of environmental science while using the same tactics. If the premise of this book is accurate, that science is used by idealogues to distort the truth and promote their political philosophy, well, what can we make of this book? Does the politics lead or the science?   I would suggest that you look into the history of the authors to determine whether they are capable of non-political dispassionate scientific inquiry. I have looked, and guess what? It isn't love, its prostitution 
 Blech!  I really like all the young actors that were in this movie and expected it to be really funny and cute.  WRONG!  It was a bizarre combination of shock tactics trying to show how edgey they all were.  The only redeeming actor was Justin Long.  The rest of the movie was a waste of brain cells 
 I agree with a number of previous reviewers. Grimassi stretches a poor understanding of historical context to fit into what he bounces between "wicca" and "witchcraft".  Wicca is not an old religion, indeed it is not much of a religion at all. It has always lacked definite theology (what is the saying about ask three wiccans what they believe and you'll get four answers...) and Grimassi does more damage than good by presenting historical materials is non-scholarly lights. In fact, the book is poor on all accounts. From confused terminology to "chopping" of source materials. This is a waste of money 
 I did not like this book at all, and thought it inappropriate for young children.   My son kept asking why the children on the playground died, playing "Bang, Bang your dead".  (I also don't want my son being taught games about violence.)  I did not like suicide being presented as an "option" for hopelessness.  Read this book before giving it to a child 
 This book is a resource, in its own way.  A more candid or comprehensive confession could never be found.  This book reveals the intellectual bankruptcy of the leftist education establishment in truly astonishing detail.  In the "letters" I read there was absolutely no evidence that any authors admit the basic realities of edcuation.  First, that schools must teach hard facts, and nothing but until the facts are taught -- ignorance larded with cultural sensitivity, political empowerment, or respect becomes the only thing WORSE than ignorance: ignorance without shame.  Second, that schools can only be as good as the majority of the parents are committed to home teaching, home discipine, and home ambition.  If you have true concern for committed parents in bad economic circumstances, give them the tools to rescue their children from the malign ignorance of their neighbors 
 I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world 
 I do not like software. It always hang no matter what I did. Maybe this is becasue it has not finished the index process? I had many many photos  in my computer.  
 Doomsayers are nothing new.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when Jewish populations were growing rapidly in many parts of Europe, anti-semitic politicians and demagogues leaped to the fore and claimed that Jews were a fundamental threat to society.  Jews stole jobs, polluted and corrupted society, destroyed culture, and were responsible for crime.    I see a similar fear now re-occuring, except now it is for Muslims.  Muslims, as a fairly conspicuous minority, make easy targets for Europeans to blame their complex problems.  However, while Europe does face some real difficulties in economic, demographic and social terms (including with integrating minorities), the notion of a collapse of Europe into something like Afghanistan or Iran or Pakistan or Saudi Arabia is nonsense.  While Islamic radicalism and terrorism are real and dangerous threats (as the recent MI5 report indicates), terrorists and terrorist threats come from only a small fraction of the Muslim population.  Problems with economic integration stem not just from religion but also from issues related to racial discrimination as well as things like inflexible labour laws, which the French have refused to reform.  When it comes to problems like demographic decline, or economic stagnation, the Europeans have only themselves to blame, and need to adopt a more entrepenurial spirit.  They also need to recognise the need to allow people to openly practice religious faith, lest dangerous pseudo-ideaologies fill the void.    However Muslims only form around 10% of the population in France and 5% of less in the UK.  The fear of being 'bred out' is an illusion, and in any case many non-Muslim migrants are arriving in Europe each year from places like Romania and Poland.  Will the UK become Polish and Romanian in two or three decades?  Free borders are important in a globalised world, and history has generally shown isolationism and protectionism do not work to build rule of law, democracy, and prosperity.    Demonising Muslims and other minorities is a dangerous way of trying to get out of dealing with complex issues, which Europe has to do if it wants to compete with India and China and the US.  Muslims need to be seen as assets rather than threats to society, and while Muslim community leaders have an obligation to stamp out terrorism and radicalism and ensure proper integration, Europeans have an obligation not to repeat the ugly past in their treatment of minorities 
 I really hated it. It seemed like the author hated all men and blamed all men for it. It made me really sad and did not help in my recovery. It may be a good source for friends of the victim but it isn't very helpful to the  victim 
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
 It's unbelievable how confusing a fluid mechanics book can be. Tritton achieved to present fluid mechanics in a way that only mathematicians (with usually no interest in fluid mechanics) can comprehend. If you need to really understand fluid mechanics and not to continuously deal with divergences and curls, better look for another book 
 It's a shame that Garmin won't allow you to buy the individual components in case something gets lost.  I had to buy the whole mount just because I needed the rod connecting the base to the Nuvi 'holder' for the portable friction mount. 
 I purchased this for my eight year old niece. We were both disappointed when it broke after only two weeks.  Be prepared to have limited options for fun without downloading it on your computer. The program takes up a lot of memory on your computer's hard drive 
 I admit it was a quick and entertaining read, and I enjoyed the first part of the book. Then it became pat, implausible and annoying. A better written book in Mommy lit category would be I don't know how she does it by Allison Pearson 
 This book was assigned reading in an introductory philosophy course and I am very, very glad I read it at the end of the year rather than at the beginning (although it is too simple for a college level course in any case), because Nagel's conclusion suggests it's all an exercise in futility!. Although it is a good introduction to some of the major questions of philosophical enquiry for complete beginners, I feel that Nagel should have included some recommended reading at the end of each chapter for those who need more depth, especially for readers who are not using this book as part of a course in philosophy. Those same readers might well be put off by the dour ending of the book which strongly hints that (1) any God is merely a God of philosophical gaps (2) ultimately life has no meaning and (3) those who look for meaning are probably taking themselves too seriously. Why do philosophy then? And why write a book about it! 
 I have lived in El Salvador now for over eight years.  To visit El Salvador for three days and continue to make a profit on those three days -past- seems completely immoral to me, especially since the book remains in print and continues to influence the world's opinion of El Salvador.  I find this completely unfair.  Would it be possible for Joan or Oliver or anyone else that enjoyed an income from the events of 20+ years ago to come back and revise their assesment?  It would probably cost them all of two or three thousand dollars for the trip, but of course, it would stop the thousand if not million dollars in sales of these recollections which were wish fullfilling fantasies to begin with.  All of El Salvador suffered during this time, why perpetuate the suffering?  And what about any three days in any given city in North America?  Could'nt the "glass is half empty" scenario be drawn to horrify any sensible person from every wanting to visit there, simply by selectively clipping the daily paper?  I think so. 
 Read her blog before you buy the book.  I don't like her writing style and should have known her book would be very much the same.  It was all over the place and left me feeling sorry for her.  It just shows that you can have everything in the world (children, love, wealth) and still be miserable 
 If you do buy this book save the receipt so that you can send it back if you are disappointed like I was. No respectable publisher would ever publish this book 
 I had high hopes for this book but I was a little disappointed.  Parts of the job I wanted to know about were glossed over and boring things were described in excruciating detail 
 Utterly predictable plot and indulgently plodding direction sink this movie.  I happened to watch it soon after seeing MYSTERIOUS SKIN, which features the same issue, same state (Dorothy wouldn't recognize Kansas, though the various Capote movies would), some similarly indulgent editing in the cereal scene, but in contrast to THE UNSAID is worth a visit.  HUFF blows this paltry meller out of the water 
 [...]Save your money folks; this book is just plain awlful! The book is full of hype and doesn't deliver. It is poorly written and truly a very boring book with no true depth or insight as claimed. Plus, the binding soon began to fall apart like the cheaply made book it is.[... 
 I've been kinda exclusive to Remington MS3's for a few years. They've just been had inexpensively here and there so that's the main reason I've stuck it out. But in all honesty, these seem to cost me more than I've thought in the past.  Like other reviews have stated, this razor takes effort to get close. Hair does collect on the foils and thus as I've noticed, causes the blades to bind on stubble. I'm a patient person, not usually in a hurry to shave, so again not too big a deal after a quick cleaning.  But here's the weakness: the foils are like paper, and flake holes in them.  I just purchased the 2700 right before the holidays for about 25 bucks (a good deal I thought for a microscreen 3). My other 0003 was shot and running on a foil or two (once a hole developed, and I'd rashed up my neck accidentally, I removed the bad foil). I'd bought one foil pack before and gradually went through those. So I thought a new unit was the trick.  Well, now just three months later, the new 2700 has burned through two foils and is down to two (used a foil from the 0003 when the first went out). My bathroom is riddled with these things. My patience is now out and I'm headed back to an old faithful: Braun 
 I picked this book up at my public library because I had put it on my reading list a while back when I saw that the President(!) of the United States George Bush read it while he was on vacation too.  I went to my local cofee place and got a MEDIUM regular cofee flavored cofee but in a LARGE cup (so theres room for plenty of milk which I like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large).  Anyway I am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where I have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there.  So then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning.  And he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing.  Anyway then he leaves and I notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as I thought previously.  So I'm not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so I take it back to the library.  Now here I have to point out that I had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that I returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight.  Well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever I go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when I turn the book in.  I explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me.  But you can guess how this ended up.  I am down another $8 dollars and change (I paid the .50 cents in pennies I got from the place I keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since I counted them out one by one but it was worth it).  And I never finished the book since it was ruined.  But! I liked the parts I read "okay" and if the President likes it I guess it gets FOUR STARS only I made it TWO STARS because I only read half.  Maybe I will read the second half later if that librarian retires and then I will come back and give this book it's missing TWO STARS if it ends well.  Lesson learned is life is not always fair but you "keep on keepin on" like they say 
 Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought 
 1. The persective of most writers is shaped by their own experience. Dr.Steele is an American Black, a baby boomer, a member of the academic elite, a liberal arts major, and a political "conservative".This certainly affects his perpective when he discusses social issues.  2. I felt that he was on pretty solid ground and made some good points when he was telling about his own experiences growing up in a segregated America and during the civil rights movement. His take on the psychological hangover after the 1964 passage of Civil Rights legislation regarding the attempts by the white power structure to regain "moral authority" by doing GOOD....and the black power advocates ready acceptance of those attempts... helps explain some of the dysfunctional after- effects that are still with us.   3. Where I disagree with his analysis - speaking from my own experience and perspective of course - is that he takes the race issue which he says has been pretty well settled in the US and then blows it all out of proportion by saying that white guilt is the underlying cause of nearly every difficult social issue in the last 50 years! And he blames the "dissociating liberals" (whoever they are) for attempting to deal with these social issues. Excuse me, but I recall Nixon and the Reaganites being in power for awhile and the Bush dynasty is still with us and I haven't seen a lot of effort being done to get-together and fix things for average folks here in the good ole US of A. Of course pressing the GUILT button in this mainly Judeo-Christian culture is a sure fire way to get everyones attention.  4. My point is that by injecting  blatant partisanship into the discourse he took a premise that people of all persuasions might coalesce around and instead divides us even further.His statement about Red and Blue States was a hoot! How is this helpful? Where are his suggestions for improvement - other than that he thinks Bush & Co. now have the "moral authority" that has been so lacking in America? Some might be inclined to disagree.  5. Finally, as a black Dr. Steele misreads me as a white liberal in that I have never felt guilty about my white heritage - only ashamed for the historically extremely dysfunctional behavior of many of our fellow humans - themselves victims of misbegotten religious dogma.If we stop trying to improve our world just because we make mistakes in the process.........and if we fail to learn the lessons of the past,we will be condemned to repeat them or be blown into outer space.Not a happy prospect for this social progressive and fiscal conservative. 
 While Dr. Grandin's poignant unraveling of the mysteries of autism deserves the accolades it has received, her perspectives on animals are deeply tainted by her research into "humane" slaughter techniques, which ultimately have an economic rather than a purely scientific rationale. After all, the meat industry cares not one iota about whether animals are treated humanely or not, only whether they can be "disassembled" as quickly and efficiently as possible. Thus, while Grandin's work may indeed make the treatment of farm animals more humane when they reach their brutal demise, it nevertheless facilitates the expansion of an industry that is anything but humane, bringing ever greater numbers of animals under the sway of its remorseless logic of bloodthirsty death. History does not judge the petty functionaries of the Final Solution, the ones who devised more efficient means of killing human beings, to be heroes; nor should history judge Temple Grandin to be a savior of animals. If her concern for animals goes as deep as she claims it does, she should turn the wealth she garners from the meat industry against its practices, donating all of her meat industry earnings to animal rights causes. Ultimately that is the only way she can begin to free herself of the moral stain of responsibility for the brutal death of innocent creatures 
 Not impressed at all with this cd. I was really anticipating that  it was going to bring some information that would assist and instead, it was basically a rundown of David Lynch's life.  I will be donating this to the library. Thanks though. Not every thing can serve everyone. 
 As a white man, this book offended me several times during the first five minutes of reading it.  If an author wrote in the same way about black people the book would not even be published! I am tired of the double standard! Thank god I didn't pay for this book and only checked it out at the library 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.  
 This book's information is generally accurate, and it's easy to read.  However, readers should know that the American Academy of Pediatrics sold this book a formula company. Now, the company gives hundreds of thousands of copies of it emblazoned with their logo to pediatricians offices to give away for free.  If the American Academy of Pediatrics really cares about breastfeeding and the well-being of breastfeeding mothers and babies, why would they sell their book to a formula company?  Perhaps the answer is because the American Academy of Pediatrics depends nearly 100% on the pharmaceutical and formula industries for its financial support.  There are many excellent books on breastfeeding:  Newman and Pittman's The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers; Mohrbacher's Breastfeeding Made Simple; Sears and Sears' The Breastfeeding Book, to name but a few. Buying one of them will not support the American Academy of Pediatrics, and in turn, the formula industry.    
 What the heck WAS that? I just watched this and . . . what the heck WAS that?! The cover looked good, but I think they spent 90% of their budget on the cover and didn't have anything left to actually shoot the film. This looked like a junior high school production shot at a sleepover! By the way, there is no house like the one on the cover, there is no little boy on a tricycle . . . there is no reason to watch this.  Unless you just want to laugh at the corny lines and bad acting : 
 This book is basically Marxist view of art, and what art is intended to accomplish.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing!  It does help you to examine your assumptions and beliefs a bit, and that's one of the things an education is supposed to do.  The book repeatedly hammers the idea that art serves the purposes of the ruling class.  This is beat upon to the point of tediousness.  There is also a chapter that can be summarized as "art serves the purposes of powerful men by trivializing women and encouraging them to think of themselves as an object d'art for the viewing pleasure of others.  Oddly enough, the book didn't really return to this them in the final essay when it talked about the visual image in advertising.  That's an arena where visual imagery is used to play on the insecurities of everyone, but especially women, to convince them that they are flawed and need __(fill in the name of a product)____ to be happy and respected and glamorous. Speaking of which, one of the more interesting points in the book (even though I believe it is flat wrong) is the discussion of the rise of "glamor" as a desirable trait.  I found the book interesting, and it irritated me, but only in a good way--By making me think about my views.  But it really is written from the perspectives of a trendy liberal from the early 1970s.  Instead of closing with a powerful message summarizing some important aspect of art that we have been taught, the authors even use the final paragraph of the last essay to point out that capitalism exploits the masses and coerces them to ignore their own best interest(that's literally what it says!).  Probably worth reading, but not a high priority.  The Penguin edition is compact and affordable, but the B&W images are so small that much of the value of the work is lost--You can't see details of the art being reproduced 
 I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. 
 I had to read Annie John for my English class and I can say that it is probablly one of the worst books I have read yet.  Not only are the characters difficult to relate to, but the book is extremely dull and written as a comeing of age story. Basically, the book starts out with Annie, the protagonist a girl growing up in Antigua remembering how much her mother loved her when she was a young girl. Then, in the next few chapters, Annie describes herself as a 12 year old girl going to school and having an overpowering love for her friend Gwen.  She has behavior problems and does some things that her mother seems shamed about and she further distances from her mother. The next couple chapters, she is an akward 15 yr. old in classes with older girls who are more developed then she is as she puts it and she dislikes this.  At this time, her thoughts that her mother doesn't like her have escalated into her hating her mother and her thinking that her mother returns these same feelings.  She doesn't love Gwen anymore and feels lonely.  Finally, when she is 17 she leaves home and goes to train to become a nurse and oddly actually will miss her mother even though throughout the book (for the most part) she has shown strong resentment and hatred towards her mother....Anyway, this book was so extremelly horrible and I hope you don't ever read it. If you decide to read it or are forced to I pity you, because this book is trash and I don't see why anyone would publish it...BIG MISTAKE on their part.  
 I would possibly recommend this book for children but not for the serious reader or someone who needs information pertaining to African-American scientists and inventors. The book has a very elementary style of writing and few citations of where the information was obtained. I was expecting a book with deep information of African-American history but was disappointed in the juvenile nature of the book 
 i'm very dissapointed with this book. The whole story idea sounds fascinating, but. you see the book opens out with the point of view of Patsy, the oldest child in Patrick Henry's family. You really build a bond with her, when she crys you cry for her as well. Then her part abruptly ends and goes on to her sister Anne. Anne goes on and on about how evil Patsy is and she turns the readers against Patsy. So by the end of the book you hate Patsy but you also hate Anne for turning your image of Patsy to a bad one. The story itself ends tragicly as well. I total this is a book where nothing good seems to happen to break up the bad parts. i give it two stars for the Patsy part but overall i don't reccomend this book. i'm dissapointed also because there was hardly any mention to historical events and life. This book will leave you feelin crummy. don't read it 
 Before I bought this book, I think this book is about the philosophical account on the scientific research.  After I bought this book, then what?  I was very disappointed, this book is just about the practical application of experimental design in scientific research.  Thus, the more apt title for this book is "Application of Experimental Design in Scientific Research" 
 The blurbs on this volume give the game away: the notices (one from Newsweek and one from the long-defunct New York Herald Tribune) date from its release a half-century or so ago. Indeed, the Alexandria Quartet hasn't aged well, but between its puerile conceits and purple prose, I find it hard to believe it was ever well received. (I asked an older friend how it had managed to gain a reputation and he attributed its success to the boredom of the late 50s. "Could that explain Mailer too?" quipped another friend of mine.) I was drawn to the Quartet because I was intrigued by its structure: four volumes recounting roughly the same events from four different perspectives employing various narratorial devices. Also, as a fan of Proust, the promised psychological approach and, yes, lurid subject matter appealed to me. But 70 pages in, stuck in a novel-within-a-novel even worse than the actual one, I couldn't bear it anymore. If you're thinking of buying this book, read the opening paragraphs, with their multiple ellipses and exclamation points, to give you a taste of what you'd be in for. If you're in the mood for a multivolume meditation on love and friendship that vividly depicts a time and place--and is witty to boot--check out Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time or the big guy, Proust himself. 
 If you are a Christian, this book isn't for you. It is full of blashphemy, concluding that we must "... forgive God" and that we must love God "... even if He isnt perfect". Kusher even has the will to say that "...God would not be God..." without our love for Him. At one point he reduces God to an aminal saying that in the garden of Eden, when God said "...let US make man in OUR image" he was speking to animals and creation. Kusher explains that God created the world, and in the next paragraph that we came by evolution.    Since when was God in need of forgiveness? Isnt it that "... God so loved the world" and it wasnt us that loved God? I have no words in describing this book. It is full of error, because it does not base it self on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. All this book does is frees you from the thought that you are a sinner, and that it isnt your fault, and that actully you are a good person. Why do bad things happen to good people? Wrong question. There are no good people in the world in the first place. " for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God..." The world is in sin. The world DOES NOT HAVE GOOD PEOPLE!! Only by the grace of God, through faith in Jesus Christ you are made righteous. I beg you in the name of Jesus Christ to stay away from this book. It hasnt helped 4 million people, but it lied to them. Kusher, please turn from your ways and come to Jesus, then will you understand the life question "WHY" 
 I really enjoy the idea of this item as it will definitely save some careless people headaches. However, I have two MacBooks in my home and have gone through six of these adaptors in eight months, which breaks down to 1.33 a month! The cords consistently separate at the connecter. I suppose if your laptop remained on a desk and you didn't travel a lot it'd last longer. They need to reinforce the wire where the cord and the adaptor tip meet. I would NOT buy one of these as an extra one, because it is highly probable you'll have an issue and if you buy them over the counter you only get a 14 day return policy. At least with the MacBook purchase it covers you from one-three years depending on if you bought AppleCare. 
 Maybe I loved the original one too much, but this version of the story did not work for me. I especially was dissapointed in the music and the oompa loompas. Stick with the first one. It was perfect 
 Superheroes are adolescent power fantasies. They should not be taken seriously by anyone over the age of 10. After that, they should only be read for laughs and kitsch value. This book is just silly. Comic book superheroes cannot and should not be compared to real mythology that has lasted untold generations and has literary merit 
 With all due respect to scientists and those bound by current-speed-of-light-as-norm post-CreationWeek: there is an unfortunate tendency to use modern, human post-Creation parameters, assumptions and calipers to measure what miraculously instantaneously divinely happened in Genesis 1-2 (easy to make category mistake, like measuring how long wine takes to make/ferment by today's stds. and applying that fixed rate to John 2 Cana winemaking or Jesus' instantly creating mass of baked bread/dried fish for 10,000+ lunches).  Please consider the likelihood of God not having yet established fixed speed of light at 186282mi/sec. while He was creating light energy and galactic phenomena on Day 1 (creation of disembodied light itself) and Day 4 (creation of embodied light confined to sun, stars, galaxies, etc.)  Read Dr. Humphreys "Starlight & Time" and Dr. Sarfati "Refuting Compromise" for Biblical alternatives to eonism and God being bound by modern understanding of photology/light years.   There are two choices given the vast distances of stars: 1)recency of creation with lightspeed infinite as God created ("Let there be stars AND let them be seen NOW" simultaneously), then post-Creation fixed at appx. present rate; or 2)rather unlikely opinion of anciency of progressive evolutionary emergence with lightspeed constant from eternity with NO possibility of rate variance when God spoke light into being.  Prayerfully allowing Genesis to speak for itself without a lab coat you may find room to budge from today's fixed post-Creation lightspeed misapplied to Creation Week's Day1/Day4 as the sole option in one's scientific perspective.  Peace to all who let Christ's Bible speak Of infinite lightspeed in one young week 
 Cheng Man-Ch'ing is a cult figure in taiji, with a fiercely loyal group of followers.  Certainly he was a master, and this book provides excellent photos of him doing the form.  But taiji is all about movement and feeling, and still photos can't convey the quality of movement or hint at the internal mechanics of the art.  So if you want to use the book to learn the form, forget it.  If you have a good teacher, and want the book as a source of inspiration, by all means, buy it.  If you're a Cheng Man-Ching fan, keep in mind that he talked and wrote about taiji, but much of his power was derived from nei gong, including the small and great heavenly circulations, that he kept a closely held secret, for reasons that remain unclear.  Temper what he says with the understanding that he held back as much as he offered, and you won't be frustrated by doing the form over and over without getting anywhere near the benefits Cheng derived.  Bottom line is that the book is an artifact and a good one, and it was one of the first books in English on taiji.  As a learning tool, it is limited.  
 I have never read one of Johansen's books and after reading this one, I'm not likely to read another.  I usually enjoy reading pretty much any type of mystery and am not a literary critic by any means, but I just couldn't get into the story here because of the flowery and cliche-filled writing.  Exclamations such as "dear heaven" and "lord" were repeated over and over again by all characters throughout the book, which doesn't seem to fit with the rest of their conversational tone (it would suit my southern grandma, however).  As another reviewer said, the big mystery of why Daisy wouldn't leave Geneva wasn't particularly mysterious - if she really wanted Jason to leave she could have just told him.  Character development was lacking and I just didn't care that much about them.  I would have liked to hear more about Cynthia and her antics.  I did finish the book because I was curious to know what happened, but I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Sorry, but this was not my cup of tea 
 only a few channels worked and were fuzzy,  sound never worked,  remote worked once then never again  cheap product dont buy i 
 In the 1960s, Andrew Greeley was often accused of never having had an unpublished thought. Following his inordinate number of novels, we can now add that he hasn't had an unpublished fantasy. This scattered and strangely dated book envisions a kind of fantasy revolution in an American Catholicism where lay people can be holier than priests (no kidding) even though most of them scoff at strictures against birth control and even abortion, where the biggest problem seems to be that someone removed the statues from the sanctuary of the parish church while failing to appreciate how movies like "Dogma" improve on 2,000 years of theological reflection. He seems to think it objectively true that guitar players are all terrible musicians (take THAT, Les Paul) while all organ players are virtuosos.  He has identified a class of Catholics called "liturgists," whose passionate aim is to strip worship of anything beautiful and everything ancient while replacing it with a pimply-faced folk singer thoroughly versed in his three guitar chords and three hundred heinous hymns which parishioners listen to because they are polite.  He does mention in passing that the new authoritarianism and dogmatism are having an effect but seems oblivious to the fact that those reactionary forces, the ones that elected our new Pope, are spiraling out of control as politicians are denied communion for upholding the law of the land and the priest-pedophile scandal is rapidly morphing into a combination cover-up and gay-bashing frenzy.  Greely is coming out with a book that purports to explain the mystery of the recent papal election. I hope his big issue is not the poor color coordination of Benedict XVI's liturgical vestments 
 Seriously, is there ANYONE who can tell me just what the hell this album is supposed to be called? *Sigh*, these idiots don't even know how to spell properly. Anyway, this album, by far, is probably the worst of all the Lil' John attrocities, which is saying a lot since Lil' John really is a horrible artist 
 Unless you are a far-left political idealist; "open-minded," as Mr. and Mrs. Stone say, their book offers little useful information for retirees 
 About 8 months ago, during a very bad "flu-experience", I had a great afternoon reading all the negative reviews on 'The Alchemist' and this little gem. And although I was warned, I just HAD to find out for myself (some stubborn people just never learn, do they): could this book really be as awful as these reviewers said it is? And the answer is YES.   The story is utterly predictable and boring. The characters and plotline are as thin as the paper this book is printed on. As a writer, Coelho totally lacks a sense of humour.   To top it all, Coelho has added a few 'exercises', to help the reader with his/her own spiritual development. Perhaps the most stupid one of them all was to pour some water on a non-water-absorbing flat surface (e.g. a table top), and to dabble about with your fingers in this self-created puddle. I can't even remember what Coelho claimed the effect would be, but it would be a very deep, spiritual and revealing experience. If this appeals to you, please buy as many of his books as you like. You will probably love them. If, like me, just the thought of doing this silly exercise makes you laugh (or cry, depending on your mood), please stay away from this author. His books are just as deep and spiritual and revealing as this puddle.      
 I purchased this unit a few weeks ago, and it's been trouble ever since.  I think I managed to get one decent cup of coffee out of it, but not as good as my old fashioned percolator.  I read all of the instructions, I read the tips, especially regarding using a coarse grind, but 90% of the times I used this, the coffee would stay in the top vessel for hours.  Of course, with the great vacuum created, there was no way to separate the two pieces until the pressure equalized, leaving a top-heavy, unstable vacuum inside cheap, thin glass; a disaster waiting to happen.  Well, it finally happened.  After attempting yet again to get a cup of coffe out of this thing, using the coarsest grind I could find, the liquid again remained "stuck" in the upper vessel.  So I left it to cool, thinking it would eventually  equalize on its own.  After about 1-1/2 hours, all but about 10-15% of the liquid had moved to the bottom vessel.  Since I had already used my electric drip machine to get my morning coffe and I did not want to be late for work, I decided to go about my morning rituals.  While in the shower, I heard a loud noise from the kitchen.  Upon entering the kitchen, I was horrified to see coffee and glass EVERYWHERE.  Coffe dripping from the range hood, splattered on walls, ceiling, cabinets, and appliances over 5 feet away, and glass shrapnel in other rooms over 8 feet away.  I can only be thankful nobody was in the room when this happened.  Since not evan I could believe what I was looking at while I was actually looking at it, I decided to take a few pictures.  I will be making these available for all to see in the near future.  I will attempt to include a link in a future review.  So now I have to spend most of the day, missing work, cleaning this abominable mess.  Oh, by the way, coffee stains so I'll probalby have to re-paint the kitchen.  If you buy this product, I would highly recommend the following accessories:  1 - A good HMO (just in case) 2 - Safety goggles as a minimum precaution 3 - A "frequent flyer" card from your favorite local coffee house, where you should be able to get a decent cup 
 I recently purchased the software above only to find it does not support my dvd drive  (HL-DT-ST RW/DVD GCC-4482B (1.00)I have unsuccessfully tried to contact roxio support three times.  No response.  I did go through the long list of supported drives and also emailed my problem to Roxio.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed and do not recommend the purchase of this software.  I have a new Gateway desktop that came with the above drive.  
 I wanted to give this book a chance, and wish I hadn't bothered. It reads like an acid ramble -- cosmic assertions tumble over startling insights, with no notion sustained beyond two sentences, properly connected to others, or backed by evidence. I kept waiting for him to settle down and present out some facts and build his case, but he just keeps laying bricks on air. I researched some of the more checkable facts, and found him generally wrong: for example, Isamu Noguchi's "The Sculpture to be Seen From Mars" looks nothing like the "face on Mars" (which was an illusion anyway), which he says shocked him into realizing the transmission of universal information. The irony is that despite savaging Western science as unable to understand the Maya, he is so absorbed in his own insights and revelations and discoveries that he never tries to see the Maya through their own eyes, as any good scientist would, and so fails to truly respect the subject he supposedly exalts 
 I didn't realize I was ordering a miniature of the book and would like too return them.  Can I 
 This book falls short in the presentation. It does not include any information on topologies for SMPS over 500 watts and its only reference design of any high current bulk power supply is a current mode controlled 280 watt Half-Bridge converter which can be scaled but it does include a lot of information on basic converter design. If you are looking for information to assist in the design of high power smps then look else where, this book will not help you. A better choice is Switching Power Design by Abraham Pressman. 
 Wow, if you have read previous ten reviews you'll think that Mr. Pancake was the embodiment of Faulkner, Tennessee Williams and Malmud. It is truly unfortunate that he killed himself in 1979. If he had lived, today he might be one of America's great short story writers. His writing style is measured and sparse. It is as if he had not looked to expand his writer's pallet of possibilities.   Pancake's is a story worth knowing for its sense of profound loss not its sense of contribution. His stories of West Virginia draw you in and leave you with a satisfaction of understanding the protagonists and their situations. But, there are no deep messages. The deep messages were still in the heart and brain that were stopped by a self inflected shotgun blast. Cry for the loss. There is not a volume of work to celebrate 
 Don't purchase subscriptions from Amazon or Magazine Express.   The following are my experiences with a subscription to Hiragana Times from Amazon.   What this page doesn't tell you is that the Japanese magazines subscribed to on Amazon are filled by a company called Magazine Express and are shipped SEAMAIL from Japan which mean you'll recieve every issue 8 to 10 after it's released.   I placed my order in January and, to date, have not recieved a single issue. After several phone calls, the Magazine Express people (who fill the Amazon subscriptions) said they had to restart my subscription for the May issues which will take 8-10 weeks due to shipping issues. So after ordering in January, I will not receive a single issue of this uncancelable magazine until possibly in late July. Very poor service.    This is unacceptable for a magazine that most US Japanese bookstores (fujisan is one) can get within a week or that you can order directly from the publisher for only a few dollars more. If I had known the shipping policy I would not have ordered and the magazine supplier, Magazine Express will not cancel the subscrition.   I advise avoiding ALL Amazon magazine subsriptions due to their poorly stated policies.   **Update, I wrote this review in June. It is now July 8th and I've just been informed I must wait until August 15th to see if an issue arrives. I ordered the magazine on January 9th and I have had no resolution from either Magazine Express or Amazon who provides no way to contact anyone within Amazon about magazine orders. I reiterate, buying magazines from Amazon if a poor idea 
 I have decent respect for Amanda Marshall, and when her first album came out, it was not bad as far as pop albums go. Granted, it was only a pop album, and it was not stellar, but from that album I decided to investigate her music further as she put out more albums. Thus, I decided to grab up this latest attempt of hers to make pop music.  Well... it's pop music, that's for sure. It has a very weird mix of strings, hip-hop, and beats that I can't say that I dig on very much, myself. The combination of all of these elements seems rather awkward. Further investigation only seems to work against this album.  This album seems to have contorted Amanda Marshall's vocal career toward the current trend of pop sound. Her elegant voice on this album sounds much more manufactured, shallow, pale, machined, and extremely short in range. These are the kinds of qualities I expect in the pop singers like the current Britany Spears and Christina Aguilera as far as how they "reinvent" their sound. Amanda Marshall's vocal sound, in my opinion, takes a step backward because of this mixing/masking catastrophe.  Finally, one of the saddest things I find about this album are the lyrics. They aren't intelligent, snappy, or even strike me as anything other than juvenile/adolescent at best.  This album is not a very strong effort for this artist. Some rather odd/off-sounding elements coupled with an awfully invented mechanical sound that waters down her vocal potential with some equally weak lyrics does not make for a striking effort. It is different, but not all different is good, and I believe a listener would find more enjoyment from either her self-titled album or "Tuesday's Child" if you haven't been completely turned off with her from listening to this album. 
 Katzenbach demonstrates ameture descriptive ability combined w/ a poor plot.   I put it down 5 times before page 40.  "Wrong Man" left my gut wrenching w/ memories of the $25 I paid for it.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! 
 Unfortunately, this book doesn't make it any easier to understand various critial theories.  It skims over them in a way that requires the reader to already have a basic understanding of the theories, and it often explains the theories in the jargon of the theorists.  In other words, it isn't very helpful for those trying to get a handle on unwieldy theories.  It isn't a basic introduction, nor is it for "dummies."  
 I would gladly take my hour and a half back.  I enjoyed the humor of ST 1, and there's only a nod in that direction here - so lame, it only serves to draw attention to its absence.    Also, this turns into a slasher flick - a systematic knock-off of each of the characters and an exploration of how gruesome the special effects can be.  Now, I'm not necessarily against this, though I don't really care for slasher flicks, other than to say that it becomes super BO-RING!  And I do mean boring  There's not even really a "B" movie quality here that provides something memorable.  Nope - nothing redeeming here.  Don't bother  
 I gave this only one star as I didn't actually read it. I thought I was ordering books for my grand-daughter, but it turned out to be audio tapes. I paid over $12. for it, but was only refunded $7. Extra fees were added that weren't there when I purchased.  I wrote to Amazon about not wanting a refund, but wanting the actual books, I got NO RESPONSE. I will never order from Amazon again, I am very disappointed with the way this was handled 
 This unit failed to provide reliable power to my new Toshiba Satellite A60 laptop. It cycled on and off every 3 seconds. It powered a 100 watt lamp okay, but wouldn't start a 250 watt heat lamp at all. Product spec sheet says it can supply 400 watt surge and 200 watts for 2 min., and is rated at 140 watts continuous. My laptop power supply is rated at 2A input at 100-240 VAC, and if it drew 2A constantly I agree that it would need 200 to 230 watts, which exceeds the continuous rating of this inverter. However, even at that power demand the inverter should run it for 1-2 min., but only manages 3 sec.  In addition, I doubt that the laptop power supply actually draws a full 2.0 amps continuously. I talked to Linksys support, and they suggested returning the unit for replacement or refund, so I did. It did not work for me. Maybe it would work for a laptop that only needs 100 watts, but I wouldn't recommend it for more than that 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 I bought this book after hearing a radio interview with Beth Teitell. The time and money spent on looking, paying and shipping the book were a waste. The only stories that I could relate to werethe swimming lesson where she didn't know the nursery rhyme and improvised and singing the Brady Bunch theme song, because she couldn't remember any others. The rest of the book (and I admit I only got half-way through before I tossed it) was horrifying.  Getting mad at your children for turning OFF the television? Telling your in-laws not to let your children nap, so that you have quiet time when you get them back? Hiding the fact that it's Halloween? Seriously, what kind of a person does this? And her husband is a pediatrician. If you are as selfish as the author, you shouldn't have children in the first place 
 "This little book has no `hidden agenda.' It is offered in the most cheerful and open polemical spirit, as an attack on a crooked president and a corrupt and reactionary administration" (1).   So says Christopher Hitchens in the preface. All though it may be the case that the book is cheerful and polemical it is also, I'm afraid to say, fairly clumsy and transparently superficial.   Hitchens begins in the preface with the possibility that Clinton may have impregnated and African American woman during his term as Governor in Arkansas only to drop the implication based on the relevant DNA data. Hitchens has proven nothing here; he has merely introduced what we already know; Clinton's sexual infidelities and callous disregard for his family and other females along the way.   -The majority of this slim book seeks to prove that Clinton in fact raped who was never given a fair hearing. Hitchens more or less accepts her testimony out of hand because he believes she is a good and honorable person and has not "agenda" in making up such dribble. Hmmm....Oh that's right, no one could ever gain anything from being associated in a sex scandal with the President (see Monica's story).   -But there is a deeper problem with this complaint. The president's sexual behavior has nothing to do with the relevant political factors of his leadership and diplomacy. If Clinton is guilty of sexual assault then he should be tried as an ordinary citizen. But Hitchens' evidence is merely from second-hand testimony at best, and at worst it is derived from an awkward transcript of an interview with Al Gore in which he refused to comment.   -The only worth while material in this book is Chapter 5, Clinton's War crimes. In it he discusses Clinton's bombing of the Al-Shifa plant in Khartoum in 1998, a clear war crime based on the evidence presented. I urge you to check this book out of the library, skip the sexual babble, and turn to this section as it is one of the view discussions on the topic aside from Noam Chomsky's comments in 9/11, which Hitchens would later blast him for as surprising as that sounds. 
 Wow!  All demographic studies are based on population data.    But this book is continually wrong in the most basic demographics! Throughout the book the authors state that the "the population of the United States was in a slow decline throughout the nineteenth century Births and immigration combined were failing to create the numbers necessary for simple replacement ..." Wrong!  Try US Census or other historic data and look at the dramatic growth through both births and immigration! The U.S. population doubled four times between 1900 and 1900!   This mistake begins on page 14 and is consistently repeated.  Where are the editors?  If the editors and authors are not just unfamiliar but absolutely wrong about population basics, why bother with the book?  See Jim Pruitt's review below for other  valuable comments 
 This camera has a very poor lens. At 1x zoom, the barrel/spherical distortion is enormous; try taking a picture of a tiled wall. Image quality is also so-so when a picture is viewed at 100%; scaled down on a computer monitor, the quality is OK. Color fidelity is next to nothing when using flash and auto white balance. [...] 
 First of all, if you know anything at all about encryption, computer security, and things like that, the technical stuff in this book will have you laughing.  Dan Brown obviously didn't research the topic, or decided to rely on public ignorance.  That's not a slam on the public, though.  Cryptography, computer security, and the like are not trivial subjects.  Still, he clearly didn't know what is and isn't possible, and in several cases his attempt to define technical jargon was just plain wrong.  The major characters in the story were extremely shallow and stereotypical.  What saved it character-wise was all the minor characters, who were somewhat interesting.  The locations and event descriptions were also good, and helped you envision what was happening.  Technical and character issues aside, the overall storyline, while somewhat entertaining, was not even remotely plausible.  The climax of the story was outright laughable.  You have a bunch of genius techies and codebreakers trying to figure something out that is blatantly obvious to anyone with any math/science/technology background, but the ideas they run through are what you would see from "average Joe".  No problem if these were average Joes, but they weren't.  So, I guess if you have nothing better to do and don't expect much realism or technical accuracy, I guess its as good a way to kill time as any 
 I can't say that I really enjoyed this all that much.  I picked it up because I had read two good reviews of it, but I feel differently.  I have a lot of issues with this:  one, I didn't feel anything for the characters - there wasn't much development at all; two, the plot was thin - a page-turner this is not; and three, the novel had a distinctive English feel to it (meaning it's a little boring).  Maybe I would have felt differently if I had read some of the other 'Frank Elder' novels, but I haven't, and I don't.  And except for the last 50 predictable pages, there's not much action here, either 
 I was so excited to find this book after reading Richard Preston's other novel, The Hot Zone. I found this book to be written extremely inconsistently. While reading this book it seems as though Preston is changing from writing to a mature, educated audience to writing for an audience of five year-olds. He takes the time out to describe each new character in a bland way. His descriptions of these people consist solely of their hair and eye colors, stature, and way of speaking. WE DON'T CARE! I wish he had spent more time on the actual story instead of digressing. He also added random sections including one accusing Iraq of harboring weapons grade smallpox without proof. I was thoroughly disappointed in this novel! The only reason why I finished it was because I was too far into it to stop when I realized how much I truly hated it! If you liked The Hot Zone, don't read this, it's awful 
 Way too blah...don't bother - better tater books out there 
 I was impressed with this controller at first, and found it to feel comfortable, and work well. It was played with once and a while for about a month (total 10 hours max). Some time after that, the next time I went to use it, it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick. I could not get it to center (or even stay still), it would just keep either steering the car (like Burnout3) or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what. I tried it several times, and it has never worked since. I fire it up once and a while to see if it's still doing it, and it does. I am very dissapointed in this, and I was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the Logitech controller. I think I paid about $45 locally for it, and I just bought a Pelican Extreme edge from Radio shack on clearance for $19.99 that works and feels as good, but is less than half the cost. I don't really feel like going thru a warranty claim, if it's even covered, but it still annoys me every time I look at it in my Xbox 'drawer' of extra stuff.  I was going to go totally wireless (4 units) and luckily didn't run out and buy 3 more of these Logitech controllers. I instead bought some extra Microsoft S controllers, as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there. If the Pelican holds up, (model PL-2050 version 2.0) I might go get some more if I can find them locally. 
 I couldn't finish this movie, it was so boring.  I guess if you are a Sean Bean fan, you must like this film.  I'm glad those other reviewers got something out of this 
 I have been tasked to translate this book to my native language.  I approached it with high hopes, having loved books in the expositive sections of this same series.  Also, I highly respected its editors.  What a disillusion!  This book has actually little to do with missiology.  Rather the authors indulge in long ramblings of ill-informed, leftist economics, geopolitics and political correctness.  They do strive to be orthodox in their faith, but then they use all the religious liberals as sources and end up in verbal contortions to disguise the liberal influence...  A waste 
 No children... bought this mobile for my office, I'm setting my sights on the final frontier.  A better mobile might exist, but I never found it.  The mobile consists of cardstock photos from NASA; I would not say it is durable, but it hangs from the ceiling so that should not be a deterent... as children should probably not be hanging from the ceiling anyway.  It's easy to put together if you have two sets of hands and hangs beautifully once in place.  Unlike a lot of the other mobiles I saw, this one has a sun... nice touch.  I would highly recommend this product.  The world needs more mobiles 
 A singularly dull book, the characterizations seemed flat and the peg on which the novel is hung, a South victorious with modern weapons, seemed too trivial.  The author has to make something compelling in that conceit or for the reader the book will mean nothing.  Unfortunately there seems little real purpose to the idea unless one finds the characterizations of historical figures believable and they are not.  The character of Robert E. Lee in the book is just too, too good to be sympathetic or even credible and the stock characters that pop up to lend support seem like cardboard cutouts.  I finally felt that the book was going in such an obvious direction that I put it down halfway through.  I am not sure if it turns out the way I think but frankly there was nothing in the first half of the book to make me care one way or the other 
 There was only one character worth liking in the book and she basically got screwed over.  There were just too many characters with no redeeming qualities.  I finished the book but it left a very bad taste in my mouth 
 I couldn't send this item back quickly enough.  I presumed by its price being 2 to 3 times that of other foot massagers, that it would be an effective, high quality item. NEVER PRESUME!    With a low powered hair dryer mounted in the middle, it sounds like a small aircract while the base vibrates uncontrolably.  I'd say about twice as much energy was disbursed out the feet of the unit to my hardwood floor than to my feet.    I'm not someone with unreasonable expectactions as many of the reviewers I've read seem to have.  This is just an unusable product.  The materials look cheaper in person, it offers virtually no "massage" to the foot, and it is incredibly loud.  There is no redeeming quality to this item.    Before I bought it, I looked all over the web for a review, unable to find one.  Hopefully I can save someone else the disappointment.  Did I mention I hated it 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 In the early 1970's Rolling Stone magazine did a piece on Roy Buchanan, the late, and great, guitarist. Roy once turned down an offer to play with the Stones. Ry Cooder was nearby, overheard the interview, and began a rant about the Stones and Mick Jagger in particular. Ry was quoted saying, as I recall, that, though Keith didn't attend the "Jamming With Edward" session, the tape was rolling. (If memory serves, Ry said that Keith left the session, supposedly, according to Ry, in order NOT to appear to be riff hunting.)   Ry said the Stones "stole" his sound and riffs. He said "Honky Tonk Woman" was an example of this "ripoff." In my opinion the signature guitar riff of this tune is definitely Ry's style.  Ry also was disdainful of Mick's so called "devil" persona. He thought it absurd that a twerp (my word but I think I'm accurately depicting Ry's attitude towards Mick) like Mick could be considered "satanic."  Later, when Ry's disgust became evident to Mick and he prepared to fly back to the states, Ry said Mick asked him what was wrong and did he want more money.   I think Ry wanted less BS from Mick and company.  
 Don't waste your time on this, it's nothing but a glorified comic boo 
 Maybe the author wrote this book as part of his therapy.  It could have been such a nice book.    To read about something as idiotic as putting a small dog and a weasel into a barrel and closing the lid until one killed the other is just too much.  The dog is the one left alive, but has been hurt so badly they have to shoot it in the head.  Then there is the pig mating scene.  Yes, we all know "it" happens, but my child does not need to read about "thrusting" and blood running down the gilt's leg.  The boar owner makes a comment that the next time the gilt will stand still for it.  Great message for young girls.  When I asked children what they remember about the book, they tell me the above stories.  One did not even remember the boy's father dies, but remembered the above graphic situations.  Much is lost on them.    The graphic situations ruined what could have been a good book 
 this is too funny Ohio exit polling must have been much like Illinois?  I voted Bush and afterwards was Swarmed by 3 thug looking "exit pollers" who looked angry when they asked me who I voted for   "Kerry" was my response... they happily jotted it down.  so much for the exit poll conspiracy.  please don't slice my tires !!!!  
 Don't get me wrong- I am a fan of Akrobatik. Ak has an amazing voice, flow, and lyrical ability BUT he came up way short on this full length release. I was not only dissapointed...but BORED. Production was lazy [not live] and Ak more or less came up short on the lyrical side. If you are wanting your fill of Akrobatik I would suggest- The Perceptionists 'Black Dialogue' album [with Mr. Lif and Fakts One] rather than 'Balance'. Also peep 'Ruff Enuff', 'Battle Royale', and his tracks with Lif. 
 This book is the worst.  The suggestions of things to do are just plain aweful.  It seems to suggest every crowded fair and typical tourist attraction in any city.  This would be great if you love crowds and mayhem.  The suggestions are useless.  New Years Eve in Times square?  Mardi Gras?  Acadamy Awards?  Carnaval?  Who's not aware of these events?  It could have some redeaming qualities if it had suggestions about where to stay and how to plan these types of trips, but it does not offer any other information than the dates and location.  Nobel Prize Ceremonies?  Running of the Bulls?  Come on!!!! What a waste of paper, money and time.  
 I purchased this item and one month later I still have not received any paperwork. I emailed and have not received a reply 
 Love Medicine was a required reading in my upper division English course in college. I was not impressed at all. The writing style is very good but the story and characters are complete pathetic and miserable. If one doesn't know anything about Native Americans, he would think that they are nothing but alcoholics and losers who didn't have enough gutts to make anything out of their lives despites the hardships that the government bestowed on them. There is not one likable character in the book. Everyone is either an alcoholic, a run away, phsycologically challenged or has children from multiple partners 
 I should first say that I have not watched the series, but will follow that up by saying that this movie has not persuaded me to do so. I am a casual anime fan and for reference will say that the anime's I have enjoyed include Dragon Ball Z, Outlaw star, Cow boy bebop and Ninja Scroll.  If you have only seen 2 movies in your life time and the other one was "Big top Pee-Wee", then maybe (and I stress maybe) I could understand a 5 star review. If you are a die hard fan of anime and if all it takes is a couple of bloody scenes this may be for you. If you are 15 years old you might be impressed with this. However if you expect depth of character, story evolution and strong plot, skip this.  In a nut shell some girl is depressed and wants to disappear/Die, what ever, so she disappears and shows up in Gaea as the Wing Goddess. Two separate factions have been warring with each other over a dragon armor suit that holds the fate of the world. The girl is the key to the suit in a way it goes to whom ever she decides; the good guys get it the end. Believe me when I say this is the better telling of that story and the less painful one.  The Good: a couple of good fight scenes and the animation were pretty good.  The Bad: The tone of a movie is very important and this story was way over dramatized. The characters aren't developed at all so you can't really bring your self to care about them, or want to pay attention to them. The movie felt like they were trying to squeeze the content of a long draw out series into 95 minutes and they failed miserably. I considered turning this off several time but felt that I should finish and form a complete opinion about it. Well I have and it aint good.  
 Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series.  
 I loved this movie when I was a kid. I bought it out of nostalgia, and regretted it. The movie may have been good for its time, but it is just bad now.  Rock Hudson gives a not-believable performance as a Sub Commander, and the bad guys are sterotypes. 
 I am so tired of reading IBS books that promise to help and don't deliver.  The book had the standard "eat bran" and "keep a food  diary" advice that my doctor gave. This doesn't help me. I also don't  want recipes for hamburgers and alfredo sauce when I KNOW that high fat  foods make me sick. The author claims she has IBS but if she eats the way  this book suggests I doubt it. I didn't learn anything new or helpful for  controlling my symptoms 
 This is a great idea: a small CD player to match the rest of the Tivoli line. Unfortunately, the quality of the units I tried came nowhere near the quality of the rest of the Tivoli line. All in all, Tivoli sent me four of these units and each had problems: one wouldn't play the disc, one wouldn't eject the disc, one had an LED readout that would go blank, and one had variations on all of these problems. The Model One is a great product and the PAL and the others are close behind, but the Model CD needs a lot more work 
 Please don't get me wrong. I am a HUGE Dan Simmons fan. I am an avid fan of his Hyperion series and I am waiting with serious anticipation for a movie series to unfold. While reading Ilium, I fell in love with the slightly dorky Hockenberry and the glorious Orphu and Mahnmut, worrying and fretting about their outcomes in this finale...  I was SO disappointed. This is just not Mr. Simmons' best writing. At BEST this is a melange of notes, maddeningly short chapters that jump from one subplot to the next (you literally have 5 or 6 subplots with an added one or two thrown in in the last 100 pages just to tick you off). Then, when you are heading for that all critical showdown with the antagonists (of which there are a minimum of 4 major and a whole slew of minors including Helen of Troy), you get NOTHING. I mean, there IS no showdown. The horrific Setebos and his evil sidekick Caliban (who was supposed to be THE bad one in Ilium)...Well, let's just say that Nada, zip and "What the He**!!" were my thoughts and exclamations. It was just awful. You get some seriously disturbing scenes like semi-necrophilia/rape the stasis patient (a la Kill Bill Part 1) which frankly, leave a bad, stinky, taste in your mouth. There is a lot of mind numbing exposition/explanation of physics and brane holes and all the things that make you think that Mr. Simmons is just trying to prove he ran these things past physics/chaos/quantum theory prof friends of his. (My favorite quip from anyone like this was simply "Quantum Physicists have P-branes".)   The book starts out really well. The chapters are of good length. Then they get smaller, more frenetic and things spin in and out and back again until you KNOW the end is going to slam into you and you are not going to like it. It's the same thing I have found over the years with Anne Rice. She would start out with an amazing plot and lose it in the middle and muddle her way to the disappointing, often hard to understand end.  And MAN, if Odysseus were really alive today, there is NO way he'd have followed Sycorax through time just to get it on with her. He'd have tricked her to be with his beloved. Come ON! There had to have been SOME kind of heroic ending instead of him just turning into a horny old time traveler! Gads. Such a letdown!  And BY the way, what EVER happened to the STRONG WOMAN characters that he seemed to have in his previous novels? In this one, she leads her wounded and left for dead group of friends out of serious danger then has a baby and BAM, she is relegated to a minor character who defers to hubby by the end. (Must be all the BOOK LEARNING he could hold over her head. Maybe he didn't send her as many PACKETS????) She just turns from heroine to glowing barefoot momma with kids in the background...ick.  Mr. Simmons is an amazing writer. I would really like to see more of the Hyperion series with a fresh, new slant. I have said this before and I hope I don't see these things anymore. I do not ever want to see another literary translation of a major epic in any more of his sci fi books. The man is seriously intimidating in his love and knowledge of ancient literature but, I can't take another novel full of clips from Keats, Yeats, Proust, Shakespeare and the myriads of Iliads. Moreover, I don't want any more stories with brane holes, creches or resurrection couches. And for goodness sake, stop with the mini-chapters and zillions of characters and sub plots. Too many to keep up with.  All in all, I am seriously disappointed. I even popped for the signed leather limited edition. Oh well. I hope for many more. They can't all be divine. But no more stinkers please!!! I like you too much to see you steep yourself in more of this! 
 Big fan of Nas, but this moive's a bit over the top and have some good messages that suffer because of it. Visually flashy, vacant plot, and messages are reduced to sermonizing. Skip this and watch Juice instead 
 I mean really. Going from Chapmen's past, the present, the past, its giving me a headache when i try to read this thing. Go read Who killeD John Lennon if your desprate for Chapmen's life, but please dont read this book 
 I really cannot understand why this book has earned its acclaimed classic status.  It has little beyond the usual tired trading psychology:  - don't bet all your capital in one idea; - cut your losses; - follow the trend while it's good.  That's all - seriously, who still has not known about all these points, and for free?  Most of the interviews have not delved deep enough into how these traders analyze a trading idea, what frame work they use, why system, what data source they follow etc.  Most of the time, I have to conclude that they did it by pure luck.   Here is an example.  "... I had a plan.  I would wait until the market moved up to a certain level and then retracted by a specified amount before adding another unit..."  How did he come up with the level?  And why specified amount??  It reads terribly like he just got it off the charts!!!  Let's face it.  If I am a big, profitable trader who is still making money off my supposedly ingenius trading system, would I want to publish it in a book and share it with the rest of the world?  There you have it.  I would not want to waste your time or mine any more on this grossly over-rated book 
 the plot is very original and the special effects are cool but the jokes all fail...badly..with jerking off jokes like "excuse me i have to go choke my monkey" this is a film that falls short in laughs and i mean tha 
 The publisher limits how many pages can be printed. If you want to print say, two chapters, to take on the plane for reading, you can't print that many pages 
 This books packs about 20 pages of content in to 250 actual pages.  Uses big text and lots of white space.  Also fills space by repeating same basic ideas over and over.  Would make a good pamphlet.  Don't waste your money 
 I purchased this book for the $3.49 price.  To my surprise, it really is 4 pages, small pages, and the list price on the book is $1.50.  There are about 24 small stickers, the size of a quarter.   Save your money, it's not worth the cost of the book plus shipping 
 I think if you've lived life under a rock, watched a lot of soap operas, and enjoyed life playing out in neat formulas, this book will appeal to you.    It makes me angry to read this book; not because it's fiction (and I'll call it completely fictitious garbage), but because James Frey tried to pass it off as nonfiction!  He writes this book with an underlying tone "I'm better than all of you."  Not because he thinks AA is BS, but because this theme runs throughout his book, in so many situations, that after awhile it becomes laughable!  He prances around feeling vindicated for all of his actions and everyone else is just a plain a-hole, except his tough guy "friends."  I ask you, if Leonard has such a reputation... where's his protection?  People would be after him in such a vulnerable (read: no security) place like rehab.     I think if you sat back and read this book you as the reader could discern its BS by feeling its predictability.  It reminds me of a comic book where the tough guy is actually the hero who comes in to save the little people, yeah, he's got problems, but he'll prevail because he's James Frey!  No thank you.  I absolutely hated this book, but I read it so I at least deserve credit for trying. 
 I can't believe how many good reviews I've read. I feel like I read a completely different book. The plot moved like molasses; the characters, and the heroine in particular, were excrutiatingly bland. The mystery wasn't suspenseful, and the "romance" had no spark. I'd expected great things from this story due to its comparison to the books of Elizabeth Peters, but it turned out to be very disappointing 
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
 I am NOT a fan of this book and I'll tell you why. I have SEVEN children. Yes, you read that right.  We have triplets, followed by twins and another set of twins ALL under the age of 3. God must think we are special, though we know we are blessed. But, obviously we run a tight budget on kids things. Living in NYC in an apartment does not help things. Honestly, I  thought this was a book on bargains and it not. It's a review book to take shopping. So much of this information is based on nothing really.  I highly doubt readers are getting any kind of credible information. These authors have HORRIBLE reviews. Have you read them? Take a peek at the 1 star ratings... wow! Glad, truth be told!  My kids Ellen, Elizabeth, Emma, Valerie, Veronica, Edward and John all are spoiled rotten with hand me downs and the occasion new cool gadget for kids in the house but the boys (just 4 months) really needed new things after all the girls and I am so disappointed this book has little to offer. And--they offer nothing about potty training products which I realy could use advice on for the triplets... just 2. Moms like me need a better source than this book. I'm searching the internet instead 
 This cd sucks! Nobody can sing! Andrea McCardle is a horrible annie. Reid Shelton is the worst Daddy Warbucks Ever. Bert Healy sucks too. I Hate This Cd. Please Don't buy this, I'ts Horrible! It's A Humiliation To The Musical Annie! I'm 16, and I Grew Up with Aileen Quinn as Annie. Alicia Morton is The Best Annie. If you want a good Annie Cd, Buy The Television soundtrack to Annie. Everybody on this cd Sucks 
 t.i. aint no king of the south, first off no new school rap artist will ever claim that title... DJ screw is spittin in his grave over this horrible artist, Lil flip be a freestyle king from da south, we got them oldschool TRU boys who would rip T.i. apart, its just a matter of time tell T.I.'s one hit wonder falls off the radio or the bullets acually hit his scrony bod 
 I was stuck without a book at the library a few days ago, and this was what I came up with.  I've read "Confessions" and "Shopaholic Ties the Knot" before, but really, this is too much.  Why would Luke Brandon love Becky?  She is constantly immature, sneaky, and deceitful, and I don't really get what goodness overcomes this.  I probably wouldn't be so frustrated except that I always have to finish a book once I start it, so I was stuck with it until the end 
 I wish I had done a little research on this book before reading it.  As it turned out when I was near the end of the book it struck me that I wish I hadn't bought or read it.  Undoubtedly the author is a talented writer and an impressive researcher, but the book's almost nonexistant focus on Chaplin as a filmmaker should be a caution to any reader.  Before getting to the bulk of the book I will point out the one positive aspect of the book.  Chaplin's childhood left me in awe.  To say that it was tough doesn't even come close, and I couldn't help thinking how lucky he was to rise from nothing to the succesful filmmaker that he became.  Then there is the rest of the story.    In the +500 pages of 'Tramp,' Joyce Milton concentrates on two aspects of Chaplin's life.  First, the author details the many sad and destructive relationships Chaplin had with his wives, mistresses, and countless others in Hollywood.  Almost no one comes out looking good in any of these relationships - not Chaplin or most of the women.  For about thirty years, until his marriage to Oona O'Neill, it is one tarnished and ruined experience after another.  Paulette Goddard is one of the few who comes out in any positive light.  And of Oona O'Neill, the one woman that Chaplin seemed to be able to have anything resembling a successful relationship, we end up learning the very least.    Second, the author dedicates an excessive amount of space on Chaplin's Marxists views.  The point is clear - it is the highest irony that a multimillionaire actor had such strong opposition to free enterprise.  A lot can be said of that, and Milton takes every opportunity to do so.  The endless cast of insigificant Communist sympathizers goes on and on.  What a boring lot they were!  Eventually I read over these parts with no care to retain any of the information.  In the end it was just plain tiresome.    It was largely surprising how little space Milton spent on Chaplin as a filmmaker.  Many of the chapter titles are Chaplin's own movie titles.  Yet, for example, in the nearly 30-page chapter 'City Lignts,' if you were to string together the few paragraphs that actually deal with the movie 'City Lights' you'd be lucky to put together 2 or 3 pages.  At the end of the book, Milton makes the point that if you want to know Chaplin as a filmmaker, watch his videos, they are readily available.  I second that - rent or buy his videos, skip this book 
 My all time favorite book is Deavers THE BLUE NOWHERE and The Testament by another author.  I think this book is on the bottom of my list.  It was a combo term paper and novel.  I wonder where the editor of this book is.  Where was he/she?  It read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them.    Don't worry Jeff, I'll still buy your next book...I've bought them all but please ...get a second opinion about your editor. I good editor wouldn't have let it go out in this shape. 
 This album is all about sex and infidelity, is this all way Usher's life is about. This album contains to substance worth listening to. This album is a total waste of money. I like 8701 100 percent better 
 I am a big Catherine Coulter fan, but this book is awful.  You can skip all the Soap scenes, a waste of space.  Much of the dialouge made no sense and the characters were very flat.  Don't waste the $6, borrow from the library if you want to read 
 Not very readable, didn't find it interesting, after going through the first part of the book i put it somewhere and never bothered to completely read it 
 The first set that I got from Amazon had major production problems with the third CD and it couldn't be played.  Amazon replaced the set and the replacement set didn't have problems -- they could all play.  My complaint is not with Amazon.  On a more serious basis, the audio cds refer to things that are not in place.  They refer to a hard-copy list of high glycemic fruits and vegetables that was supposed to be included.  This hard-copy list was not included with either set that I received (in case they just screwed up on one).  Even more interesting, in the audio it refers to the fact that additional information is supposed to be available through the Atkins web site, lists an address (http://www.atkins.com/agr) -- and that's not a valid page.  You get the dreaded error message 404 page.  I sent email to the Atkins' site and got no response.  This could be solved by adding the page mentioned in the cds -- and adding the information that's supposed to be included on a card.  Right now, some of the key information that you need to make this diet work is not available.  You would still need to go buy the book to get that information.    I am a fan of the Atkins diet and had hoped that this cd set would be helpful for a friend with diabetes.  It is not.    I would not recommend this cd set.  If you care about the information, then buy the book.    It is my understanding that this cd was produced by a different company than the people who produced their other CD set.  I'm sorry they didn't do a better quality control.  
 It looked like such a good idea on TV but that's the thing about TV. They didn't fit well on my stove at all and I couldn't even put my other stock pots on my back burners at the same time. Also the bottom scratched after a couple uses! 
 The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere 
 I have bought the GPS recently - and it took me a good week to set it up - coz the GPS just wouldnt connect based on the SINGLE PAGE INSTRUCTION booklet they give. then i had to contact Customer Support in TAIWAN!!!!!!! for gods sake!! and once i installed it - i realsed they dont have the NAVIGATION software come in the CD with it!! its only a GPS locator - that will tell u which longitude and latitude u r at! BIG HELP!!!!!!!!! 
 A book on AppleScript, written in 2004, that completely ignores topics "data sources" and "data representations" can hardly call itself a bible.  The problem with such books, that write from real-life experience, is just that. They miss the real-life experiences of the rest of us. This book asks use to shun the label that "it is just another book on AppleScript," but that is all it is. Even 800-plus pages of oversized print cannot justify the $60 price tag 
 Dosn't work.  Still receving lots of auto-dialer calls.  Waste of money 
 This book relies heavily on squirting cats with water, which is not a positive reinforcement. Also, the steps do not address problem cats that don't want to cooperate. For instance, the section on nail-clipping tells you how to clip a cat's nails, but does not address how to get a cat to accept nail clipping without fussing 
 I love the variety in block designs, however, I'm not all that ingenious with calculations to figure out what I need for a 12inch finished piece.  I'll eventually figure out how to make some of my favorites-with trial and error I'm sure- Instructions would save me a lot of time and fabric.  In all I'm sure there are better books out there for someone like me who's not a math wiz 
 First, I'd like to correct one of the other reviewers, who said that SNITCH'D is about a "Latino cop" who goes undercover as a high school student.  Actually, the cop (played by writer/director James Cahill) looks Asian but is supposed to be white.  He's certainly not supposed to be Latino.  We know this because one of the students calls him a Spanish name, and Cahill's character has to ask a fellow student what he was called.  "White boy," she replies.  Also, I don't think the movie is set in East L.A.  The credits say it was shot in Santa Ana, a heavily Latino city in the middle of Orange County, which is just south of Los Angeles County.  Yes, the movie is inept and unrealistic.  Many of the actors playing these high school students look well into their twenties.   The guns look like toys.  Sound like it too.  When they're dropped or tossed aside, you can hear the hollow plastic clatter on the floor.  Yet this movie is entertaining, in a weirdly "what were they thinking," endearing sort of way.  Star-writer-director Cahill smirks his way through much of the film, like he's trying to play a suave James Bond type.  You look at him and think, this inept, non-charismatic Asian-playing-a-white-guy actually imagines he's the next Rambo/tough guy/action hero.  Especially funny is his pursed lips and staring eyes when he sneaks around the house with his gun in "action hero" fashion.  Cahill is morbidly funny!  And yes, his "martial arts" is as inept as the film's toy guns.  He grabs a guy's head and repeatedly "slams" it against a desk in what's supposed to be a quick "jack-hammer" fashion ... only it's slow, and the victim's head clearly isn't making contact with the table.  The victim seems to just go along with having his head banged against the desk, because director Cahill told him to.  Also funny is when Cahill uses martial arts to defeat some eight gun-totting ganstas, partly with the aid of ping-pong paddles.  One "actress," when she's acting "sad" and telling Cahill about her recently deceased friend, seems to be actually smiling.  This film is probably being seen only because its female lead, Eva Longoria, has become famous on DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, although she isn't much better in this film than the rest of the cast.  Some, but not much.  Then again, it must have been hard for the twentysomething Longoria to play a high school student swept off her feet by Cahill, or mouth his script's cliche-ridden relationship dialogue.    Their "flirting" in the library is another very funny moment!  They're supposed to be teenagers, yet their relationship dialogue sounds written for adults, who in turn got their lines from bad romantic comedies.  I said this film is endearing.  I have a soft spot for amateurs who buy a camcorder and think they can make a Hollywood style feature.  Although I think this was shot on super-8 or 16mm film.  That's because you can hear a camera whirring in some of the shots.  And there's a soft, shot-on-film-then-blown-up look.  So although this film is inept enough to merit only one star, I'm giving it another one for unintentional humor, Longoria eye candy, and the effort of getting it finished 
 What was Bobby Hicks thinking about when he recorded Fiddle Patch? He has ruined some good fiddling by including three vocals which would make any country music lover cringe - they are straight out of the Top Forty charts. As examples of soppy, stupid, schmaltz they excel and should never have included in an album of traditional fiddle. You have ruined this CD for us Bobby please do not do it again 
 This recording is just ok.  I didn't see why she needed to do a cover cd patti is so much better than this and it's not that she is singing the songs just ok it's just that she doesn't add anything different to them to make me say yeah thats it.  make the next recording will be the one i can enjoy until then i guess i will put "flame' my favorite patti cd 
 The tecnical quality of the book is not good, it should have bound, not just glued together. My book is already starting to tear apart after less than a month, even though I handled it careful 
 Don't spend the extra money for this translation. Buy the Dover Thrift edition. You get the same story for a buck or two, and this translation is nothing spectacular 
 This novel employs weak and/or untenable character motivation to carry a ridiculous plot that presents itself as a "novel of ideas" but is in reality a pastiche of solipsistic ramblings and cullings from secondary sources.  As a novel of suspence, the narrative leaves loose ends and holes at nearly every turn, and the closure is so tepid I couldn't believe the diting could be so careless--one is led to think this "plot" is leading up to a climax, when instead what we get isn't even anticlimactic 
 While few can argue Mark's rise to fame and fortune is anything but spectacular, but to believe that virtually every decision he's made in his life has turned out fantastically well is a bit hard to swallow. At every turn (which happens to be accompanied by the phrase..."I jumped in...") is another remarkable success.   If he showed a bit more vulnerability in his stories, it would have been more believable, insightful and inspirational.   I also could have done without excruciating detail of every season of survivor...it got a bit old 
 I'm really surprised the authors became so famous as the new gurus of CRM or 1to1 marketing. This book is just a collection of superficial case studies but it says nothing on the technologies used, the real problems companies had to face when they implemented CRM programs. This is just a book for high school kids or sunday newspaper readers who want know more about CRM without getting into the details. Not worth the money and absolutely simplistic 
 The essential fatty acids idea is wrong. This was proven 50 years ago! It's all marketing and distortion of the facts. Check the newsletter, at Dr. Raymond Peat's website, "The toxicity of unsaturated fats" 
 First time I've ordered a product from Leg Avenue - and it'll probably be my last!  I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 "runs" in one of the legs before I even tried them on.  What a waste of money...and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I've already put way too much money into, what should be, an inexpensive product 
 We bought this for my 7yr old son, and in 2 days he had totally destroyed it. Thank goodness we had it on a tile floor. He kicked the bottom and it broke letting out all the water! What a mess. Not worth the money 
 This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down.  It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest.  There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.   There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable.  I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction.  Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead. 
 Richard Roeper is the worst thing to happen to movies since the corporate take-over of the studios in the 1980's. He cares far more about celebrities, his own image, and behind the scenes gossip than he does for any film. Whereas a good critic would find ways to help people love movies (or any artform) more, Roeper almost never does this, choosing instead to focus on the most negative elements of many of the films he writes about. Even the descriptions above, by the publisher, highlight this fact: he writes about "Reviews of Hollywood finance." (Rather than encouraging people to care more about the story than the budget.) "Actors who appear in television commercials." Does Roeper want us to focus on who does commercials, or focus on each movie, and decide whether its story is told well or not? Citing two unsuccessful films, Roeper proposes a "moratorium on pet projects." But Roeper wants to oversimplify films so he can snarkily make his point, when he ignores the reality that many, many successful (i.e., well-told) films are "pet projects." Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, or Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ are two strong (and very different) examples. But Roeper just wants to dumb everything down (including the movies and movie audience) for his jokey complaints. I do believe that this very shallow man loves movies, but he uses a tremendous amount of power and energy encouraging and teaching people to utterly dismiss entire movies because of one or two irrelevant elements. A quick example: When the film "Chicago" was in theatres, Roeper nearly bent himself double complaining fiercely about the fact that the movie wasn't filmed in Chicago - EVEN THOUGH THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT IS ON THE SCREEN. I heard him being interviewed on a radio show, and the host was scoffing at "Chicago," saying that he wouldn't go see a musical. Rather than stepping into the role of film critic and defending the film as sexy and fun (Roeper gave a thumbs up to it), Roeper merely complained about the location of the shoot again, and never said another word about it. Disgraceful. This book is NOT, "a love letter to film." It is a course in learning how to diminish and dismiss film, our greatest artform 
 With Just Rewards, BTB has managed to write the worst book of Woman of Substance series!  Emma's Secret and Unexpected Blessings lacked a certain punch and certainly rewrote the history of the first 3 books.  However, the characters in those 2 books were at least likable.    In this book, Linnet appears to be a unbelievable snob - pretty much turning up her nose at Evan's sisters because they're adopted (People without the noble Harte/Oneil/Kallinski) blood aren't as good as everyone else.  Evan's mother, father, and grandmother love Evan much more than her adopted sisters.  Apparently, Evan's sister was a 'foundling' and has no chance of being as good as a Harte.   Evan is shocked that her father would feel that he is cut out of her life!  However, she allows her 'in-laws' to plan her whole wedding, ends up having a secret ceremony in which she is more concerned that Paula and Shane attend than her own parents.  Paula, who used to be one of the smartest business women in the last 30 years, has all of sudden become one of the dumbest.  In the past, BTB made her heroines a bit too perfect - but at least down to earth.  Now, we're supposed like people that seem to be insensitive snobs.  Also, this certainlly doesn't appear to be the LAST book of the series.. 
 I was looking forward to reading this book with my women's Bible study group.  I read the first chapter and decided I hated it.  Stormie is a martyr, has a negative outlook and lets her husband walk all over her. This is a book only for women who hate their husbands and want to live life as a martyr.   I was looking for a book that would help me pray for my husband who is a wonderful person.  He treats me with respect and listens to me.  Stormie makes it seem like you can't pray for a man who doesn't abuse you and make you cry everyday.    I've been with a man like that and if I'd married him (Thank God I didn't) Stormie would suggest I let him hit me, call me foul names, etc. while looking for where I was to blame.  However, while I've grown spiritually and become more prayerful in my life since then I am not fundamentally different.  I have the same flaws I've always had and my husband has never called me names or touched me with anything other than loving hands.  Also as far as his sexuality goes, I've been on antidepressants that severely affected my sex drive.  I've since changed medications, but through my three months of struggle my husband constantly sought ways to help ME because we kept the lines of communication open.  I felt guilty enough about my lack of feeling and Stormie would have made me seem selfish when my body felt dead.  I am not saying that there aren't things we can change about ourselves that would make our lives and marriages better.  Prayer is a wonderful way to seek God's guidance in how to handle a situation.  But we must be willing to listen to God when he calls for action as well as for inaction. We need to be willing to handle the situation.   If you are screaming at your husband, then "shut up and pray!" but after you've calmed down it is time to address your issues head on.  Communication is essential in marriage along with prayer.  My husband works long hours and is often travelling for business but he is ALWAYS home when he says he will be give or take 15 minutes.  There is no excuse for the disrespect of abandoning your family without notice. There is no excuse for harsh, angry words.  There is no excuse for violence.  And I ask and pray that women do not pray to accept those aspects of their husbands.  AND NEVER LET HIM HURT YOU!  Pray for his heart to soften.  Pray for his healing, but do that from a safe distance 
 A waste of time, a waste of money. This book, dated 1981 is so out-of-date as to be irrelevant. Typical chapters cover one and one-half pages; mostly of material sent in to Hayduke from contributors to his Paladin Press  magazine columns.  Most of that material so obviously points the  "mark" in the direction of the perpurtrator (you) that  retaliation is almost a certainty. I'll be reviewing the 1999 Hayduke book,  but so far most of his stuff is a rehash of the magazine material and  seriously lacking on high tech mayhem - which is ultimately so more deadly  and anonymous 
 My purchase of this book was based on Dave Ramsey's recommendation. While I thought the book was somewhat motivational and gave some useful ideas, it did not really deliver what perhaps I was expecting. My job search took a little over 48 days and I cannot say that I referred to the ook everyday during the search.  I believe that while it may be good for some who are geared to some occupations and have some particular skill sets, it is not for all. So, while I am sure it has sold many books, partially due to Mr. Ramsey's recommendation, it is clearly not the panacea that one might be searching for. You still must find a job based on what you have done in the past and convince a new employer that you can make him money. Or you must start your own business based on your abilities and desires. Mr. Miller's book may or may not be of assistance to you 
 This is probably the worst finance book for women I have read, but it's easy and quick to get through, which can be a plus. There are some good tips - I don't doubt the author's credibility - but they're well hidden. For example, the author wisely advises single women to save up 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in case of an emergency; however, she lists "emergencies" such as a vacation to Tahiti when work gets too sressful or a new gown for a trendy benefit.   This book is also based on superficialities and stereotypes. It assumes that every urban professional woman aspires to live like the girls of Sex and the City, and that country women don't have to worry about finances because they wear overalls every day, drive beat-up pickup trucks, and marry their high school sweethearts. This book is more about how to live a lifestyle without going completely broke than it is about lifelong management of finances.  I do not recommend reading this book cover to cover. If you can find it at your local library, pick it up and skim it. If you're looking for solid and easy to read advice, grab Suze Orman's "Money Book for the Young, Fabulous, and Broke. 
 I've enjoyed several Ludlum novels, but this one is very slow and it seems to be going almost no where. I'm half way through and don't see much point in going on except to make the most of money I spent for the CD version. It certainly isn't an action-packed thriller I was hoping for. I'd give it 5 stars for non-action and lots of meaningless "yadda, yadda, yadda" if such a category existed 
 I liked early Winger, mainly their hit singles but the entire "In the Heart of the Young" album was pretty good, if straying a little too close to Def Leppard.  I have to say that those works haven't stayed with me, and are only worth a listen when I'm in exactly the right mood.  "Pull" saw a darker, blusier side and was all the better for it.  In the end, however, only "Down Incognito" and the fantasticly rockin' Leppard-esque "Junkyard Dog" remain with me to this day.  I skipped Winger altogether until I read the reviews posted for IV.  I thought I'd give them a try, hoping this time a modernized Winger would create a catchy yet serious side that held out through the whole album.  Sadly, IV falls into the same category as an English journalist once said of British cooking:  "Fine preparation, but desperately in need of spice."  The musicmanship is top notch as are Kip's vocals, the latter of which remain strong and with the same great range he's always had.  But where did the great riffs go?  IV is a softly bubbling pot of an album.  There are no songs that really make your ears perk and demand a 2nd or 3rd listen before moving on.  Conspicuous by their absense are any lasting, ear-grabbing riffs to pull you in and demand you jam along.  Sorry to say, it's an album of well-crafted filler 
 I bought this book when I first started sitting. It was too vague and not very helpful 
 Someone reported all my 3 negative reviews of Daniel Silva books and got them removed! Hmm, I wonder who that could be.   I am rather annoyed at this because I spent quite a lot of time detailing why I didn't like one of the books, reasonably, I thought. Apparently, someone had decided that they did not follow the review guidelines. I used no profanities. OK, there were some spoilers, but not more than I usually read in other reviews. Not single worded, no phone numbers, no solicitations, etc. Maybe whoever it was just didn't like my negative review. Well, the last time I checked, the 1st amendment still applies in this country.  OK, so let me try to post another review of why I didn't like this book without violating any review guidelines, and I'm not going to spend 30 mins on it like last time.   I thought the book was very poorly written and very boring. I struggled through 1/3 of the book but the author could not capture my attention and I decided not to continue to the end. I've read a couple of other Daniel Silva books, but neither one of them could change my mind that he is an author that I don't like. I will not be buying any more of his books 
 WHAT TO DO IF YOU JUST BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT: Go outside and bang your head as hard as you can against the side of your house---Maybe that will knock some sense into you after you've gone looney trying to use this piece of junk!!! As many reviewers have noted, it is extremely difficult to get this bottle warmer to work properly. First off, the little vials you use to measure the water into are poorly marked -- Why did they choose to use teeny-tiny WHITE lettering? STUPID! It is then very tricky to get the proper amount of water into the vials. In fact the difference between say, level 2 and level 3 is maybe two drops of water! Trying doing that out of a standard faucet. In fact we use a filtered water faucet (with a thin spout) and it is still hard to get write. But that's easy compared to figuring out the right water-in-the-vial to formula-in-the bottle ratio! We are currently using a 4oz Playtex bottle (with the disposable bags) and are contantly playing a guessing game as to the right amount of water to use. Level 3--- still to cold, but wait, last night that same amount of water practically scalded the formula! And just try to use a vented-type bottle...Forget it! How about an 8oz. bottle? NO WAY! Either way to cold or way to hot. And even though we use filtered water, this thing still need to be cleaned with vinegar (as recommended) evey week or so. However, the cleaning barely hepls and after less than 8 weeks of use we now use the microwave more and more. Why? Because we know that 4oz. of formula will always need 6-7 seconds in the microwave...Every time 
 Dean makes very specific accusations in the very subtitle of this book, yet he provides no documentation to back his assertions. I expect more from a scholar 
 Before you read the book, look at the sources.  I only found one scientific paper out of hundreds of sources. Everything else has to be classified as opinions.  Sources for this book  include news stories and testimonies in congress.  I will point out by two examples (not from the book, but from information that you are probably familiar with) why these are not good sources. I recall the news stories based on the opinions of experts that said it would take five years to put out the oil well fires started in the first Gulf War.  They were all wrong.  It took six months.  CEO's and others testified before congress about tobacco products being non-addictive.  Were they correct? No! So when we read this book, we can't be sure of anything.  It is a book of opinions and ideas.  Some of them may be good, but they may also be bad.  This is why we have science and the scientific method.  Even science may be corrupted at times or fail until we have a better understanding. Even if Mr. Gore had scientific papers, it is unlikely that he could judge whether they really support his environmental views.  He would need a Ph.D. or at least a lot of experience in the proper field(s) to interpret scientific papers properly.  This book discusses how corporations are unfriendly to the environment. Surely some of them are.  But so is the government.  When the government plant at Fernald, Ohio, (near Cincinnati) was accused of poluting the soil and water with radioactive waste, the government denied, dragged its feet, and fought in court. The government lost it case because there was obvious guilt, but the government did not hestitate to fight against the very people it represents. When you or I appear to be at fault in an auto accident, do we admit it and offer to pay all claims, or do we take a less candid approach as our insurance company suggests?  We might even think we are not at fault. Mr. Gore has denied being at fault countless times in his political career, but he can't believe that a corporation should do anything but admit guilt, accept every environmental claim that is made, and pay large sums of money.  Mr. Gore is an elitist.  First, he believes that he is an environmental expert because he has heard a lot of opinions. He doesn't need an advanced degree in environmental science  or experience in that field.  He just knows better because he is Al Gore. Secondly, he sees how he uses the environment and how you should use the environment quite differently.  When he was Vice President, he flew to Kyoto, Japan, to symbolically (read unnecessary trip) approve the Kyoto Treaty.  He used more than 180,000 gallons of fuel in a private government plane in one day.  My wife and I can drive our cars and heat our house for our lifetimes and never use this amount of fuel.  During his Presidental campaign, Mr. Gore would fly a private jet to his son's games.  I have no great objection to the former Vice President doing these things as long as he doesn't start telling me how I am abusing the environment, that I should drive an electric car, ...  I do have trouble believing his environmental views are anything but political.  If you like the views in the book, read it and feel good.  If you don't like the views, read it for some good laughs.  There are plenty of flaws.  Books like this make money, but they don't make good science, and they don't produce good policy.  Don't forget to recycle the book 
 Have you ever desperately wanted a book to end but hated leaving it unfinished?  That's the way Sappho's Leap was for me. I finally finished it over the weekend and am still wishing I hadn't spent good money, even bad money, any money on it.  Admittedly, very little is known about the only ancient Greek female poet besides where she probably lived and a few snippets of her poetry. Her words are searing, lovely and sometimes erotic. But Erica Jong's novel fictionalizing her life was banal and boring and droll. Sappho, as her heroine is not only uninteresting, but has no single aspect of her personality that makes me like her. Sure, she experiences heartache and longing, but Jong simply fails to give me a reason to care.  Jong just tells me, flatly, in first person, how Sappho feels and what she thinks, but doesn't make it real for me. She tries to make Sappho into a female Odysseus and can't figure out if the novel should be a fantasy or a semi-believable historical account. And all that wrapped up with a very disappointing, Hollywood ending, tied it off into an unequivocal piece of garbage.  I can't believe Erica Jong has actually written and published eight novels.  It honestly seems like she wrote Sappho's Leap specifically to sell to high school English departments to teach a bit of Greek history with a feminist slant.  Regardless of whatever pocket genre she was trying to exploit, Sappho's Leap is utter tripe 
 i ordered this last fall for a 40th party it looks nice but after a windy day a piece of the top broke off and after that it all fell apart because it didnt have any support from the broke top rail 
 I gave this book a low rating, not because it's "offensive," but because it's blah humor.   I am a huge fan of offensive parodies (ex - South Park and Family Guy), but I found this book disappointingly boring. The jokes might be funny to the type of person who laughs at things like outdated Pollock jokes, but most folks would find it to be a major yawn-fest...or just annoying. If I get a funny book, I want to laugh through most of it--not just a random sentence or two on every 50 pages (too much work).   Anyhue, if you want to laugh at pregnancy, better books are "Be Prepared: A Practical Handbook for New Dads," "My Boys Can Swim" (for the gents) and "Pregnancy Sucks" (for the ladies). They are waaaay more funny AND somewhat educational too (whoa! what a concept).  
 This book seems like a good idea.  It does contain a good amount of information about starting a business, but a lot of it is toward starting a business in general, rather than about a claims/transcription business, in particular.  It deals a lot with manufacturing, for instance, but not so much with service, which would be this type of business.  It seems to me that this is a realistic business to start, but you'll need more than this book to do it 
 Real parents? A parent is the person who raises you and influences the person you are today. You are not a Real parent b/c you conceived the child...that person has significant value as a birth parent. I was adopted and have also adopted children and the real parent is the one who has been there, invested... 
 I recently bought this book, and then promptly returned it. The opening line of the preface is an unclear, run-on sentence, which concerned me right from the start, and the book is generally overwritten, devoid of proper punctuation, and repetitive. As a result, I feel that using this book to teach writing might be like getting your cat to teach you how to swim.  My family did have fun suggesting alternative titles before settling on "Any Child Can Write As Well As Me Do" 
 Words need not even be wasted on this product. Besides each character having a different voice than that in the movie, the audio effects are terrible, as well as the actors and script. The one good thing about this product is its availability is limited. Save your time, save your money. Don't let Lucas put his hand in your pocket 
 This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, "Edith Wharton did it better." The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.  The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of "clever" critique into the narrative.   As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time 
 Just received my copy. There's no inclusion of the additional commands in file I/O from Verilog 2001. There's no $fscanf, no $fgets. No always @(*) explanation. If you're looking for Verilog 2001 stuff, look elsewhere 
 I don't recommend this ashtray to anyone. I was never able to use it since there were no instructions with it and I could not figure out how to put batteries in. Other people tried besides me. There was no way to contact the company as their website doesn't seem to exist anymore. At least I couldn't contact them after numerous attempts 
 Even though I would agree that "Erin Brockovich" is an entertaining movie, Julia Roberts performance in it is no more Oscar-worthy than was her performance of a prostitute in "Pretty Woman."  I am second to no one in enjoying a good "David and Goliath" story, but this movie has such shaky roots in reality, it is more of a tall tale, than the "true" story of a historic class action suit that, I would imagine, left more unhappy plaintiffs, than it did satisfied ones.  However, as the movie title implies, this is indeed Erin Brockovich's story, in the same way that the "Xena" character is the main attraction in "Xena: Warrior Princess" (though it should be noted that Xena's wardrobe is considerably more modest than that of the Erin Brockovich character).  Erin Brockovich is a vain, brassy, boorish, single mother of three young children, with no marketable work skills, a transparently opportunistic manner, who dresses very much the same way as the prostitute character Roberts played in "Pretty Woman" (prior to Richard Gere's character taking her on the infamous Rodeo Drive shopping spree).  The movie's beginning finds Erin unemployed and pursuing a personal injury lawsuit in connection with an automobile accident; her lawsuit is lost, primarily thanks to her own disastrous testimony (swearing, cursing and shrieking from the witness stand) while being questioned by opposing counsel.   Unbelievably, Erin parlays the failed lawsuit into a job at her attorney's (played by Albert Finney) firm, mainly by pushing her way into the office and ensconcing herself at a desk.   Later, while handling the paperwork for a run-of-the-mill, pro bono, real estate sale, Erin discovers the file contains the seller's medical records, that, for reasons she (correctly) does not understand, seem to be of particular interest to the buyer, the mega utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric.  Erin independently embarks on her own personal investigation of the case and discovers that PG&E had (for decades) negligently contaminated the ground water (surrounding one of their power plants in/near Hinkley, CA on the edge of the Mojave Desert) with toxic, hexavalent chromium.  This discovery leads to the queen mother of all class-action lawsuits (at least in terms of the award), in which hundreds of Hinkley residents sue PG&E (by and through the representation of Erin's boss) in a toxic tort action that eventually nets a 330 million dollar settlement for the plaintiffs.  Roberts gives a photogenic, if not especially gifted, performance in her role as Erin. The movie contains a plethora of flattering shots of Roberts (literally gushing out skin-tight, low-cut, bustier-inspired "work clothes" that would never be permissible attire for any employee of a law firm on this planet) as she engages in warm and fuzzy discourses with the unsuspecting and unsophisticated Hinkley residents. While there is much to be said for Erin's apparent drive and tenacity as she pursues the plaintiffs in the suit, she is not an especially likeable character; rather, she is rude, verbally abusive and only conciliatory and kind when and if it serves her interests.  Albert Finney is considerably more appealing and believable as Ed Masry, the aged and  weary attorney who is Erin's boss.  The bantering that occurs between the two is generally amusing; unfortunately thanks to the inept direction and camera work, the focus for these scenes seems to be more on Roberts (strutting about in short leather skirts and noisy, five-inched-heeled mules) than on the sometimes-interesting personality dynamics that seemingly exists between the two characters.  Aaron Eckhart plays the affable, gentle biker and next-door-neighbor, George, who becomes Erin's boyfriend-by-convenience.  The "convenience" factor is totally one-sided and for Erin's benefit exclusively; she  unabashedly uses George for free, live-in childcare, thereby giving her the necessary freedom to assist Masry as they put together the historic case.  Erin eventually winds up receiving a staggering two million dollar "bonus" check  (from Masry) when the tort action case settles; contrastingly, George gets a "thanks" for his nanny services from Erin and his walking papers.   The plaintiffs in the case are an assortment of simple individuals with unpretentious outlooks on life, who have been dealt a dirty hand by the utility giant.  Though the Hinkley residents are sympathetically portrayed, make no mistake-this movie is about Erin Brockovich (indeed, I do not think there is a single scene in which the chacracter is not present) and less about the brave struggles with life-threatening, generation-spanning illnesses that the real-life plaintiffs were forced to face, due to the toxicity in their water source.  Erin Brockovich is presented to the viewing audience (in typical Hollywood fashion) as a sort of heroine; but in fairness it would seem more accurate to say that she was a woman who indiscriminately used people, walked on others when necessary and seized opportunity after opportunity until she eventually struck it lucky and got rich.  Is the movie entertaining-absolutely.   Inspiring- not even slightly. 
 This movie was terrible. Even for an indie it was pretty dull. The acting is lousy, and the story is boring. Just about the whole movie is about this med student who is obsessed with a cadaver. The script is almost laughable and I actually considered turning it off a couple times. It was a good effort, but I wouldn't waste my time on this stinker 
 In this work, Boswell argues that rituals for the binding of two males (in Eastern Christendom) between the 12th and 16th centuries is evidence of the support for same-sex marriages in earlier Christianity. This is yet another example of a scholar misinterpreting historical facts in order to serve an agenda.  Robert L. Wilken, Professor of the History of Christianity at the University of Virginia, wrote an excellent critique of Boswell's work. The article is entitled "Procrustean marriage beds" and is found in Vol. 121 of Commonweal, 09-09-1994, pp 24. It is also on the web (do a google/yahoo search).  Here's an excerpt: On an initial reading these rituals appear similar to marriage ceremonies. They refer to the joining of two people in life-long relationship, they speak of a bond of peace and love and oneness of mind, they include ritual actions that parallel those of marriage ceremonies. Yet there are certain features of the rituals that are unlike marriage ceremonies. For example, the texts make it clear that the relation of the participants is spiritual not carnal ("by faith and spiritually"), there is no mention of the marriage bed, the term "marriage" is not used (as it is in marriage rites), the biblical readings are different from those used in marriage ceremonies, several of the rites, significantly, indicate that the relationship is that of an "elder" to a "younger," and the persons joined in the ceremonies are males.  Wilken then continues with specific examples. It turns out that, as Wilken states, "What these rituals solemnize is not 'gay marriages' but a form of ritualized friendship between males that had been practiced in the Eastern Mediterranean since the time of Homer." And, of course, Wilken proceeds to support this and gives reason for why this was done. His article is an excellent read.  For those Christians who promote the affirmation of homosexual practice, this book is too good to be true. Alas, it turns out that such is the case 
 I'm from DC so I know how the story went. A lot of details were left out. A lot of things were highly exaggerated. None of the actors (especially the guy who played Rayful) looked like the people they were playing, his arrest did NOT go down like that, no one was wearing ALL-DAZ clothing BACK THEN and they never mentioned anything interesting about Rayful that people don't already know ...like his sexuality.   With a little more planning, better casting and creative advice from established Directors this documentary could have been a whole lot better.  Since this is Kirk's first documentary he'll get a pass. 
 I am a Cary Grant fan, but I was extremely let down with this one. The storyline itself is funny, but not the antics. To sum it up, I found it slow moving and dull 
 Some of the topics presented were interesting, however I wish  more topics had been covered rather than being so wordy and devoting whole chapters to one topic such as matrices. Overall, I was not impressed and had to force myself to read to the end.  I found the presentation in general dry and uninspiring most of the time.  Some math books accessible to the non-mathematician make you go "Wow!" at some of the material they present.  This book was not one of them for me.  Perhaps this is because it is older.  The book does seems to succeed in giving non-mathematicians a flavor for some of what appeals to mathematicians and that's all it does. There seems to be more focus on the abstract rather than concrete and practical aspects so if one likes math more for the "beauty" of it's patterns, etc., then this book will be more appealing. In my opinion, it even fails in that aspect, however, since there is NO material on number theory which seems like an oversight as it plays such a large part in pure mathematics.  Some number theory, with a few of Ramanujan's contributions thrown in, may have made this a better book.  I much preferred Mathematical Mysteries by Calvin Clawson or The Enjoyment of Mathematics by Rademacher and Toeplitz, for example. 
 what makes this duo good is the simplicity of the set up...drums and keyboards. This is a band that attracts musicians more than casual listeners.   "Becky" is the best track.   I saw them live and they were more interesting then good. The music is more background music, with a tribal sound,  then anything else.   What makes them interesting and different also gives them limitations. There is only so much you can do with this set up. Ask Medeski, Martin and Wood...which blows this band away.    
 I love Sidney Sheldon's books, but I was quite disappointed with this one.  I can't believe it got such good reviews.  The story was fast-paced, interesting, and well written.  However, the ending was awful and frustrating.  It was too abrupt and too many things happened at once, it didn't resolve well.  It was also too much of a let down.  There are definitely better Sidney Sheldon books than this one 
 I was making my way through a bunch of sci-fi and this was the last book on my nightstand.  I had to *force* myself to finish the book.  I found the "hard science" and theoretical history a giant yawn.  It's the worst fiction I have read in years.  Anyone who gave this more than a star is probably a schill 
 I have the Laser Disc version of this film along with the special features.  I bought the DVD for convenience sake.  But, this pressing is not in the same league.  The DVD is not so sharp visually (which I could live with) but the sound track is terribly distorted.  In particular the choral numbers are unlistenable.  Even the two serving maids who sing along with Eliza's "I could have danced...etc" are distorted.  With all the advanced technology available to modern pressing plants, is this the best they could do?  I have many vintage film musicals and a large collection of older opera performances which have now been released on DVD and this "My Fair Lady" is easily the worst as far as sound is concerned. 
 I chose this book for a college writing class assignment. I had to read it, then critically review it. I've always been an avid reader, and no book has ever made me feel stupid, but this one succeeded. It almost felt like Rick Moody was trying hard to use as many confusing words, sentences, and formats he could think of. Some of the stories took me days to get through, and I only finished them because I had to. Some were better than others; I sort of liked "Boys" and "Forecast From the Retail Desk", but everything else left me with a headache. The worst were "Pan's Fair Throng", "The Carnival Tradition" (still have no idea what that was about), "Ineluctable Modality of the Vaginal" (16 pages - 1 sentence - give me a break), and the two "list" stories: "Wilkie Fahnstock: The Boxed Set" and "Surplus Value Books: Catalogue Number 13". None of the stories had any real character development, and some had no recognizable plots. There are maybe people who will understand this stuff better than I, but this is still not a book I would recommend to anyone I know. If you're someone looking for enjoyable short stories, please don't buy this book.  
 Koontz is one of the best writers of fiction today, but Cold Fire and Hidaway are two of his worst books in my opinion.  Not much there.  Readable but I would check these out from the Library before you add them to your collection.  Ironically I own Hard Cover copies of both of these books.  I made the mistake of buying them when they first came out because I was a big fan of his other works.  I don't own  much fiction in my library and I would gladly swap these two books for Hard Copies of Dragon Tears or The Bad Place.  I will trade both for a Hard copy of Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon 
 Sediment and metal particles settle in the bottom of your drain pan and these kits can't siphon all that out.  Most "quickie-lube" stations that pioneered this process have abandoned it because they were getting sued for damaging the engine.    The right way to change your oil is to run your engine until hot and and drain from the bottom; that does a much better job of removing the sludge 
 I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read.  I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability.  The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it.  As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting.  I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable.  
 This might appeal to fans of E!, Entertainment Tonight, The Insider, et. al.  I'm not a huge fan of gossip-lit, but was looking for a light-weight, fun summer read.  This book made me tired, as it was, for the most part, a never-ending To-Do List of menial chores for fake celebrities ("Jock Staupman" or... Jockstrap Man, yeah I geddit.) Seems like a real foolish way to make a living, without so much as a 'work-for-hire' agreement or contract. After 20+ years in the business, you'd think Heather Howard/Corki Brown would know better.  Plus, I can't imagine readily accepting abuse, assault and criminal activities--and having to haul heavy stones around a backyard.  The ending was weak and a bit far-fetched.  This book would have been so much more enjoyable if it had some depth to the job (as in, how did she get hired, how does she get clients), a true sense of the twisted, or real insider scoop about "the business."  I've read this sort of "weird celebrity requests" expose in various magazines.  If you're really keen on celebritry-assistant madness, you'd be better off renting the movie "Swimming With Sharks" (1995) with Kevin Spacey.  That said, if you're not expecting a whole lot, this book is fine to take to the beach, as it doesn't require much thought 
 I have played Zildjians all my life but this author seems to be on the Zildjian company payroll. Some good pictures but the rest is a Zildjian 'brain wash'. The Zildjian history is confusing and the overall book is poorly layed-out. You have to skip over many pages of poor quality pictures to continue to read again. You know like magazines articles where they say 'contined on pp. xxx', that kind of stuff. Book reads like a Zildjian magazine ad. Buy 'The Cymbal Book' instead 
 I read this book and tried the diet for three weeks. Although I didn't feel hungry and thought the shakes were okay, I found myself suffering from headaches and just not feeling very well in general. If you're looking for a crash diet, this might work, but I don't think it is a very healthy overall eating strategy for the long term. It does, however, force you to get more than enough fruits in your diet, which I enjoyed. Another thing: you need a good blender and enough time to clean it out a couple of times a day. Sounds silly, but it was expensive and time consuming for me 
 i have been looking at converting my car to electric but wasn't expecting to get a book that some one choose to write and then sell for $24 and it was just a copy of a copy there is no isbn # the least they could have done was went to a publishist and got it published for what i got it was a $5 book  
 After reading His Dark Materials, The White Mercedes and The Broken Bridge and enjoying them quite throughly, I ventured forth into the deep unknown of "Ruby in the Smoke", expecting something equally well written, insightful, and entertaining... what I found was below par to my standards.  First of all, the character development was practically non-existant, I put down this book feeling that I didn't really know any of the characters at all. Sally Lockhart is your average every day Mary-Sue; uncommonly pretty, quiet, strong, independent, and as flawless as the Ruby that she is destined to find. The emotions displayed at the death of her father are bland and un-grounded, and it's hard to believe that she has emotions at all at certain points of the story. There are hints of romance that never follow through, statements that are never really explained, and mystery that is...kind of unintriguing.   Setting aside the flatness of the characters (Jim was the only one that I think I liked at all, simply because he had some flicker of a personality) there are many things that just don't go smoothly in my mind with this novel. A girl wandering alone in England in the 19th century for one--although she is rumored to be independent, there really is no way that she could have been -that- independent, given the context. Her strength is too faltering to really give credibility to the fact that she wanders the streets alone in her free time in an era where those sorts of actions were not even tolerated.   Furthermore, the plot is too formulatic. It follows the Hero Motif to the T, with absolutely no bells and whistles. The heroine is perfect, the companions are as following: the charming one, the mischevious boy, the fiery maiden, the kindly old man, Ms. Scarlet with the candlestick... ok, well you get the picture. The villian is flat, cookie-cutter evil, without the dimentions that Pullman gave to his Mrs. Coultier in His Dark Materials. It's an ugly old woman that wants to kill little girls for fame and fortune. I know that this book was meant to be a cliche--but there could have been a little bit of development thrown in to make it, well, more fun.   The action is a little under-described to make anything truly interesting. It's a bit of tell-not-show writing with a dryness that doesn't go down well enough, and an ending that leaves you thinking "is that really it?" Who knows, perhaps the other books in the series are more engaging than this one--but the way "Ruby in the Smoke" reads, theres really nothing encouraging me to go on with the series.  Overhyped? Yes. Make room on the shelves for a better mystery--this is something that reads better if you don't have to pay for it, I'm sure 
 This book has some heartbreakingly beautiful photos and I love the title, but watch out, especially if you're buying a gift for a sensitive dog lover.  There is a page where a yard-dog, the kind who lives his life chained outside, is wondering why he's always chained up.  It is too painful for a lot of people to see this 
 how did heppner publish this mess of ideas and words? unreadable. possibly the worst book i have ever read. ever. ick 
 I have to confess I didn't get very far with this one. If you have to read this for a course, I'm very sorry.  I'm not an academic, but I do I read a lot of philosophy. I'll put a lot of energy into a complex text, but I prefer to invest it with works that will enlighten, not confuse.   On the clarity-precision scale, I would push Levinas right past "dense" or "challenging" and put it somewhere between "turgid" and "impenetrable." (His apologists decry the inability of human language to convey Levinas' sophisticated thoughts. Maybe so, but perhaps the apology says more about his thoughts than it does about human language.)  In any case, it will take you a long time to genuinely read this book. If you're looking for truth (as opposed to a passing grade in a required course), you would be better served by spending 3 hours contemplating and reasoning to your own working definition of the following words:  --- "totality" --- "infinity" --- "other"  Then spend 3 hours contemplating and reasoning to your own understanding of how the three are interrelated.  Then get a decent translation of Aristotle's Metaphysics. (I like the McKeon translation, but there are certainly newer, hipper ones.) Then read Aristotle instead of Levinas. If you find the idea of reading a Dead White Guy repugnant, spend the time watching water move over rocks. Either choice will provide you more wisdom than you could get from a lifetime studying An Essay on Exteriority 
 I am extremely dissapointed in this book.  Yes, some of the information was interesting.  However, there were no realistic suggestions for improvement.  As far as the homeless shelter in NYC(I didn't know mother theresa made NYC her stomping grounds), it may seem frivolous to put an elevator in a homeless shelter.  But hey guess what?!  Big surprise, some people that are handicapped are homeless too.  So I suppose they can just wait outside while a friend runs in and gets them a cup of soup and a roll.  It seems to me that Phillip K Howard is not familiar with people with disabilities or he would be singing an entirely different tune.  Physical and mental handicaps are a fact of life, and instead of putting them in institutions, hiding them away, or perhaps even enforcing mandatory sterilization(ok I may be exaggerating a bit there).  It is a fact of life, all "men" are created equal in the eyes of the law, and all of us are given the chance for the persuit of happiness.  If Phillip K Howard had his way, we would be without laws protecting the handicapped, mentally ill, and indigent members of society.  And yes, they need protection under the Law.  Because if they are Not protected, people take advantage of or ignore the rights, needs and wants of an important group in our society.  We all deserve the right to have a chance to contribute to society.  So lets not have another wheelchair bound person drag themselves up the steps of a courthouse so he could appear for a trial.  I guess Mr Howard missed that particular annecdote.  I give this book 0 stars, if I am required to give it any, then make them negative.  
 this book was not well thought out. it was just an attempt to sound intelligent, but failed. the purpose of a book the should be to enlighten your readers not with big sounding words but with good ones that best describe the situation you are trying to get across. to me the book had nothing to do with tupac, it dealt with the author's lack of ability to put words together to form a sentence that could capture his audience. he just used the icon's name to sell his book, and true we fell for it, the true fans of tupac. we try so hard to grasp hold on anything and anyone that can give us more facts than we already have, so it pains me when people do things like this book which was so so so poorly written. i would hate to have a face to face conversation with him. PAC will always be in our hearts, thoughts and thanks to the real Gs he will be on our radios, TVs, VCRs & DVDs. as PAC would say, "NEVER IGNORANT GETTING GOALS ACCOMPLISHED. 
 Its a study guide, not the actual book, waste of money 
 My son was very disappointed when he received this item.  It looks nothing like the picture.  The picture shows a whole container of viewers and you receive one baby blue view with a swirly sticker instead of the eye as in the picture.  I believe this is false advertising, and everyone should be aware of this.  I wanted to give it half a star, but it was not available 
 Since this is one of my top four all-time favorite films and I love films passionately, I am ABSOLUTELY beside myself in fury and anger at the HORRIBLE packaging on this magnificent film. I could forgive the lack of extras. I know A LOT of people working for these international movie conglomerates don't give a damn about the Classics (or even movies in general, really). But the lack of thought that went into the packaging of this truly great, PERFECT, scene-by-scene-, shot-by-shot, movie is STAGGERING. Not only do they include a throwaway line of dialog in the middle of the images, not only do they clutter it up with a bunch of extras from a scene in the boxing ring... they picture the villianess, not the heroine, with the hero ! Where is the original poster art !!!!! THe insert art !!! The half sheet art !!! The reissue art !!! There . isnt . even . a . booklet . . or . flyer . inside . NOTHING ! This looks like a release that belongs in the cheapie bin with the public domain stuff . Columbia Pictures.. I am shouting . At . YOU  
 I think they put the wrong cd in the case because most of sublimes good stuff is missing.  Weird.  Buy 40oz to freedom or anything other than this cd if you do not already have them.  It's has some good songs but false advertisement comes to mind.  Hardcore sublimers may want it, but you never really have to open it.      
 Everyone loves Rose, the first narrator of this story and the central character in the book.  Her mother loves her, her first husband, Sister Evangeline, her best friend, her second husband, and her daughter.  The only people with any real reason to love this woman are her mother and daughter, both of whome she abandons completely to work as a cook in an unwed mother's home for almost no pay for 15 years without a vacation or ever having dinner at home alone with her family.  She is completely unlovable in that the only feeling she ever expresses is toward her mother.  She says she misses her everyday.  So why does she never go back to see her before she dies?  Why does she never share with her the granddaughter that she took away from her?  Rose's idea of fun is to drive aimlessly, rent a hotel room on the coast, sit on the bed for five minutes, and drive all night to be home to the husband she doesn't love by morning.  It's idiotic.  Apparently this episode was so much fun to Rose that 15 years after it happened she relates it to her daughter as oh yes, it was so much fun.  Sounds like a blast.  She can't even carry on a conversation, much less show any tenderness or affection.  It makes the people around her who love her so much seem ridiculous.  Son can barely stand to go into the kitchen at St. Elizabeth's after she leaves because he misses her so much, even though she never considered his feelings at all when she named her child Cecelia against his wishes because it held such a painful memory for him, and when she left him to go live by herself in the small cottage.  Also Sister Evangeline confides in Cecelia that she misses Rose so much she can hardly bear it.  Why?  She was a humorless, inconsiderate (to put it mildly), cold-hearted bore.  Cecelia is the only one totally frustrated by her mother, as she should be, but even she accepts her behavior in the end.  It was a well written book that you thought might lead somewhere but went absolutely nowhere, like Rose.  When she leaves you wonder what new relationships is she striking up that she could not care less about now?  I won't read Bel Canto or the Magician's Assistant.  This book was foolish in the extreme and completely pointless 
 For an "encyclopedia" this book is severly lacking in detail and coverage on the subject. This is a thin book that gives very short descriptions of a limited number of treatments. Many very common and popular spa treatments are not even included, while other obscure and non-existent in most spas found their way into the book. If you're looking for information on what is done during many of the common spa treatments used today and what their benefits are I do not suggest this book. I was very disappointed 
 The subtitle of this book, The Lives and Films of Akira Kurosawa, is completely deceitful.  There is nothing biographical in this book about either one of its main protagonists.  It is rather a chronicle of the Japanese film industry, not without interest in itself.  However, the voluminous facts, tid-bits of information about every minor actor, director, script-writer, and film composer, as well as the synopsis of every film mentioned, makes for increbibly tedious reading.  While the book has its merit as a source of information, not much credit should be given to the author other than for his ability to put together facts that are available from a number of sources.  Meanwhile, reading all these capsules of data will leave you dry when it comes to the lives of Kurosawa and Mifune.  The author tells us nothing about how they lived, felt, thought, behaved,what motivated them; probably because he doesn't know himself.  A simple gathering of public facts, none researched by the author himself because their sources are many and widely available, especially on the internet, do not make for a worthy book 
 I must begin my review by stating that I am a reader of all memoirs because I find them to be healing for the soul. The best memoirs are honest accounts, whether the truth is devastating, beautiful or just plain boring.  I bought 'A Piece of Cake' because the rave reviews and because it was becoming available in paperback. After finishing 'A Piece of Cake', I must be honest that it is one of the worst memoirs I have ever had the misfortune of reading. The writing seemed to be done by a grade schooler: repetitive, juvenile and inconsistent - but this is not the reason the book is so bad. 'A Piece of Cake' is not a good read because I just don't believe 90% of what Miss Brown wrote.  I believe bad things can happen to a child in foster care, that kids in the ghetto get caught up in the gang lifestyle and addicts have a lot of interesting stories to tell. The reason I don't believe Miss Brown is that there is no honesty in her literary voice. Her stories are built from rusty crumbs and do not hold solid.  There are so many instances in the book that don't hold up to the light, but the most glaring untruth seems to be that the state of California would award custody of Miss Brown and her brother to their biological father and at the same time pay state dollars to a foster parent for their care. This especially seems untrue since there were other blood relatives who wished to take on the responsibility of caring for Miss Brown and her brother without the state's money. Since the whole book is based on this foundation, the whole story crumbles.  After reading 'A Piece of Cake', it is my feeling that Miss Brown was faced with many hardships in her young life and chose a road of self-destruction. She was able to climb out of the gutter and this is always a wonderful thing, but it does not necessarily mean that one's story should be made into a book.  Cupcake Brown obviously has many devoted fans of her book and I'm in the minority with my criticism. However, I stand by my review 100%.  Some memoirs that I highly recommend are:  'The Glass Castle: A Memoir' by Jeannette Walls 'Ava's Man' by Rick Bragg 'Angela's Ashes' by Frank McCourt 'Blackbird : A Childhood Lost and Found' by Jennifer Lauck 'Traveling Mercies: Some Thoughts on Faith' & 'Operating Instructions' by Anne Lamott (or anything else by Anne Lamott) 'Running with Scissors: A Memoir' by Augusten Burroughs 'Naked' by David Sedari 
 For the most part, these people whom the author thought are prominent Jews are either ignoramuses  as regards to Judaism and our heritage (especially the 2 Supreme Court Justices, who probably never heard of the concept of tzeddek) or are not even Jewish at all. A waste of time 
 Am I wrong or this movie is an insult to the king/gov of Thailand ? What's wrong with you people ? In any case it's really corny ! : 
 I'm completely baffled by the five-star reviews for this book. The main characters are likable enough, certainly, but nothing. ever. happens. There is no narrative tension and no real plot, no conflict, no obstacles for the characters to overcome, nothing of substance--just a vaguely pleasant meandering toward an indefinite conclusion. Even the much-anticipated baby seems to disappear into the background once she arrives, like a sitcom baby whose birth is a great episode for sweeps week but who is conveniently asleep off-camera  for every episode thereafter.   Perhaps my opinion was tainted by reading this book too soon after Alison McGhee's "Shadow Baby" -- a book with both style AND substance. Colwin suffered in the comparison. However lovely her sentences and paragraphs may be, in this case they don't add up to anything greater than the sum of their parts 
 This film is visually stunning and impressive, and has talented and credible actors.    Unfortunately, there is barely a story with a lot of poorly-developed characters who are "trained"/brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity.    The settings and group "sermons" from Nazi officials are striking and convincing, but there is nothing that ties it all together.  Our hero fails to strike the "killer blow" and is stripped, literally and figuratively, of all status and walks away.  The end.  I'm forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film, and I was surprised by how un-gay it was.  In fact, the two boy "friends" work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress.  It's more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else.   I have issues with some of the pacing as well.  I found myself pressing the fast forward button several times, and didn't really seem to miss much.  Not a good sign.  So, for what it is, it's okay.  Certainly not a masterpiece, and certainly not something to run out and buy.  
 The shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small...don't waste your money, it's not worth it! 
 I had order this book last year in June when I knew it was coming for Nov, than Jan.  I finally got the book I couldn't wait becuase Im thinking couture for crochet, BRILLIANT!, than I get the book and peruse through. 1st. what sold me on the book was the cover of the kimono style jacket.  Lily Chin precedes to talk about the art of couture, which houses can legally say they are couture etc..Than she has alot of schematics on couture so Im thinking where are the patterns??.  The 1st 40 pages are on nothing but that, Lily desire to do couture and stories of...Finally she did have some nifty idea on how to elimate gaps on the edge when you are do DC and HDC...When the pattern comes it is a jacket and skirt of olive jacket with some purple  and solid purple skirt.. I can see anyone where this colour of a jacket but in Black maybe so Im thinking ok what else.  Than the jacket on the cover which is called the Maiko jacket which really had my hook humming, you could of course gotten this pattern ffrom INterweave crochet. Next a shell and a cover in the same green and purple.  The next are a few more jacket a sdress with lousy colour.  The black filet looking shirt with beads and blue skirt is the only half decent out of all.    MOst of the colours are the gree, some browns and just about all are Lily Chin own yarn.  Which not all stores carry.  So than you have to either substitute or find the yarn. There is a bag with some glass beads but the design of the bag is lousy just a small box like tote.  I was sooo disappointed that when I went through the book I looked back to the cover and thought is this misleading.  The colours chosen and shaping was nothing you wouldn't see in a lesser crochet mag.  I would of thought with her talent she would of produce better.  There is no chic scarves, hat, or nice sweater, the browns are not even feminine with the yellow combo and I dont think her yarns are that great anyway, I feel sad after waiting this long anxious to get started, I had my Karabella, and Debbie Bliss ready and this is what I saw.  I would not waste your money, see if you can browse at the bookstore first before you decide to make an investment 
 Not his best stuff. He's running short of lyrical ideas, he recycles his own lines, like Star Wars recycles "I have a bad feeling about this".  Beats are usually cool, I don't care for the popish tracks with the singing. I didn't mind it so much when he sang REALLY BAD back on his first album, but now it's no longer funny, it sounds like pop.  Anyhow, organized religion is crap. I thought KRS understood this back in the day. What happened? Now he's got his own little organization and his own little phylosophy, and his only little diciples and crap, I dunno, it's posative, but then again it's gay like some of his modern tracks.  Anyhow it is cheap, if you have to finish off your collection as I do, then buy it, otherwise go buy his anything BoomBap on back. Or check out:  Kool Keith  El-P  Gang Starr  Mr. Lif  Jedi Miind Tricks  Public Enemy  Non Phixion  Sir Menelik  Most of which is better than KRS' latest works 
 It was just that dry and boring I never really connected with any of the characters, I  gave up reading about 3/4ths of the way through 
 What if you actually LIKE Edwardian or Victorian style?   The previous reviewer was dead right.  If Lion Brand is so scared of not appealing to the "hip and modern" audience why in heaven's name would they put out this book?  To destroy every feature and stylistic flourish that gives vintage knitwear its uniqueness and beauty is sheer foolishness! Good grief, if I wanted a boxy silhouette I certainly wouldn't look at a book that purports to feature vintage patterns.  This really was too bad. A fitted waist can be a terrible thing to waste 
 I purchased this for my 4 year old son because he LOVES to take pictures.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money, however this product is way over priced for the quality and ease of use.  Not to mention after having it less than 24 hours it completely stopped working.  However, when it did work every single picture was blurry.  There is only one button for every option and it is very confusing.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  It is being returned 
 These are the type of books and garbage that let an actual  abuser get away with harrassing an ex-spouse and using a child as a pawn.  Doesn't anyone realize that this gives guilty people a loophole to pass the blame for the degradation of a parent child- relationship to someone else.  If your child doesn't like you, then you need to look inward at your own shortcomings and fix yourself, not look outward for someone to blame, just because admitting the truth is too difficult.  Maybe your child just doesn't like you...and maybe the child really has been abused. I've had about enough of all these fake syndromes.  I read this book and I am appalled.  No child who truly loves and admires a parent can be manipulated into "revisionist history" and being poisoned.  Society needs to give children more credit than that...and the authors of these "books" need to find something else to do.  Only a lemming would be so stupid as to follow this author's suggestion that parental alienation is possible simply by "telling" a child anything.  Children will continue to love and admire a parent who is worthy regardless of circumstances. If you've lost their love and affection you have only yourself to blame.  My ex tells my son terrible things about me all the time, and my son simply comes home and tells me what is said.  He follows that up with "I love you" and "I know the things that are said aren't nice".  It has not damaged my relationship with my son whatsoever, but my ex has lost the respect of this child.  Think about what is in this book, and then put it down and run...never to follow this kind of bunk again 
 It's rare that I don't finish a book.  I realized after getting 1/3 of the way through it that I just couldn't get interested in the characters. Took it back to the library. A friend of mine who also reads a lot had the same experience. Harris' other books were much better 
 This is a collection of essays previously published in newspapers and magazines around the nation where some 10 years ago we could witness Lewis' early literary attempts.  Although Lewis is a witty, scrutinizing, insightful, and overall entertaining writer, I think this book is highly overpriced. Most of the topics in this book cover financial/business culture issues that date back during the late eighties, so there's also a bit of historical perspective to it, when LBOs were a la mode, Donald Trump was making headlines, and Japan was considered a threat to the US economy and welfare...crazy thought.  Go for Liar's Poker if you want to read Michael Lewis, that script is a jewel 
 this book is retared...i would never let no one else read this it really that bad...i cry it was so bad...every time i look at it makes me sneeze...now that bad...i just sneeze i look at it...it give laTisha ga 
 Horribly disappointing.  These manufactured dialogues are evidently Stephen Law's way of dealing with his personal problems with religion.  For example, in one chapter Law manipulates his "teaching" by having God contradict the Bible (the assumption being God's the author) in a dialogue with a conservative religious person. Law even sarcastically concludes the chapter by saying this dialogue is only a dream, the real God would probably respond differently.  Good idea for a book, ruined by the authors distorted logic. There are numerous ad hominen and circular reasoning errors.  The title and premise fooled me into reading it.  Mr. Law, how will you pay back the readers for wasting the time they invested in your philosphical rant against religion 
 I bought this book hoping for a Christian perspective on the Christian-themed The DaVinci Code by Dan Brown.  What I paid for is unabashed preaching on how the Gospel can be spread through never re-interpretting or revisiting the collection of stories called the Bible.    These two theological scholars don't add any additional light to Brown's story nor do they actually show proof that the DaVinci Code couldn't have been true (which, in fact, I agree that most of Brown's work is fictional interpretation.)   It seems like another opportunity for Christians to talk to themselves and reinforce a narrow viewpoint through villianizing the "mass media" and the general population.  Pure back-patting fluff 
 Professor Pollack, a pioneer of feminist criticism and art history, has written a classic in Vision and Difference.  This new edition has a cover with her surname in bold letters, Pollack, as if playing off her famous name.  An unsturdy introduction adds a page to the length of the book.    After careful study of both editions, one will find no textural additions to this edition.    The title has been changed by juxtaposing words so that the first edition does not appear along side this version. The first edition is titled  Vision and Difference: FEMININITY, FEMINISM and the Histories of Art.  Two words have been switched.  
 Like many people have repeatedly said, Bigger Faster is not a good album. 4 Non-Blondes are the epitome of a one-hit wonder band. Anyone thinking about purchasing this album needs to seriously rethink what they want to do, because the only song they'll want is "What's Up". Even that one song on repeat listens is going to get old after more than one listen. And then it starts to latch onto your brain stem and slowly kill any function your brain was capable of. It's really a dreadful song in retrospect. Linda Perry (doesn't she look like a post-op Perry Farrell?) undulates like a dying cat when she wails "Hey yay yay Yay yay yay Yaerggggghhhhh-- What's going on". It's simply grotesque. I remember that several bands in the early 90's tried their hand at this quasi Folk/Grunge conglomeration, and results were disastrous. Another one of these acts in question was Blind Melon. Sure, everyone (myself included) loved "No Rain", but if you bought the full-length album, you'd wished you hadn't 
  	The book Hubbert's Peak: The Impending World Oil Shortage is about the economy and the impact one scientist had on the world with his predictions.  Hubbert's theory stated that in the early 1970's oil production would reach its highest level. He was doubted my many scientists, but when it came true scientists used it to look at what the future holds for oil production. It is expected to hit this decade at some point. This book describes the origin of oil and development over the many years. It also describes several different oil fields and the prosperity of them, and the different types of techniques and bits used to find oils by scientists. Each scientist has different methods of finding the oil fields, and they use data sets to record the sites and sizes of them. It provides an overview of what the future holds for oil production, and what different kinds of energy we can resort too if needed to avoid the economic troubles lying ahead. 	I thought this book was overall pretty boring. I wasn't  entertained or hooked on it, and it didn't make me want to keep reading in the end. I found it very confusing most of the time, and it had a lot of information to try to digest all at once, such as numbers and equations. It wasn't the kind of book I really get indulged in, and want to read more of, or cant put down.  	I would recommend this book to those who like to read books about our economy and what's going on in different industries. This book is easier to read for adults, as it contains advanced material that could confuse younger children. For those who enjoy reading advanced books about our economy or oil, this is an excellent book. 
 Highly disappointed.  I bought this book based on a good percentage of people's review and found myself uncomfortable when she started talking about vampires etc. other than the subject of psychic attack and how to deal with it.  I dont follow everything she says as I have applied it myself based on my personal experience of being under psychic attack and attacks from evil entities (I'm a clairvoyant) with a gift of discernment.  I have dealt a frightening experience with evil entities similar to that as described by my brother from a movie his seen apparently called "entity". The best advice I give to anyone is get Robert Bruce's book: "Practical Psychic Self-defense".  I'm a bit concerned that Dion Fortune deals too much with the occult even to the point of calling out a "God" other than Jesus for help 
 This book is good for devoloping a litte more technique, but I gotta say that's about it....Example: the "chapter" on string bending is like one lick over and over again with some subtle differences. The same goes for the other chapters. They never go really in depth or give you a variety of playing material 
 I think what this movie did is not simply reverse the color scheme but generally speaking the attitude. I think it condemns for the sake of condemning and moves the problem from where it really is.  America is not perfect but it is as perfect as they come to give each individual the possibility to succed regardless of the skin color, this movie, in my opinion is anti white, which is as stupid as being anti black 
 I gave this only one star as I didn't actually read it. I thought I was ordering books for my grand-daughter, but it turned out to be audio tapes. I paid over $12. for it, but was only refunded $7. Extra fees were added that weren't there when I purchased.  I wrote to Amazon about not wanting a refund, but wanting the actual books, I got NO RESPONSE. I will never order from Amazon again, I am very disappointed with the way this was handled 
 I think the most frustrating thing about a fax machine, is when you put your four or five page fax into the feeder, and the machine sucks two or three sheets at once ruining your whole fax!  I especially got this machine because I thought it was a quality machine, and wouldn't do that, but I was wrong.  Sometimes this machine sucks more than one sheet at a time which is very frustrating.  I would stay away.  It prints nicely, but it doesn't help if it ruins your faxes.  I see other reviewers have the same problem 
 I keep reading and listening to his books because everyone says how good they are, but I have never found this to be so.  He always strikes me as someone who potters around never really interacting with people who then goes home and writes about it.  He seems more at home studying statistics (which he includes everywhere) and drawing his own facile conclusions from these statistics.  I always imagine him stuck in his room reading his newspaper, surfing the net and smugly summing up his brief interactions with people in the real world.  All his travel books are equally awful as he never really interacts with anyone - just comments on them later.  Still lots of people think he is grea 
 This vacuum hardly picks up anything.  The blower on it blows the dirt away from it, so it can't pick it up.  The noise is so loud, it hurts your ears 
 Just received my Original Big Wheel for my son and the axle that holds the back wheels on is not in the box.  I call customer service and left a message on their recorder that the part was missing.  Went to the website for faster service................ After you fill out the information, it tells you that you will have to wait 3 or 4 weeks due to high demand.  Try telling this to your kid when he is watching feverishly as you open the box.  Looks like the parts were just thrown into the box without proper packaging.  Thumbs down until I can get the parts to repair 
 Their books seem to focus on making money in real estate. Why don't they come out and say so. How many people do you know that have boought a house with no moeny down? This book is not reality but it sure is making them rich 
 For an accurate biblical view of Israel read or listen to, "The Future of Israel" by John MacArthur 
 As is often the case with this style of music ( elevator , hospital lounges , dentist's offices muzak ), this  is an unfailingly, numbingly pleasant, but unexceptional album that sounds appealing enough when it's on but isn't compelling enough to get excited about. This is the sort of album that is almost anaesthetic, you put it on while peeling potatoes or folding the laundry - in fact, best not to put it on at all.  Absolutely safe , lazy , dull , boring , cheesy and fishy...nothing fresh or new. Flat boredom.   In the same league of the latest albums by Rod Stewart , Selline Dion , Kenny G. , Bette Midler , Carly Simon...you know what I am talking about.... 
 Shekhar Kapur's vision of A.E.W. Mason's The Four Feathers is well done visually, but unfortunately much of the original story is lost to create a more fast-paced and action-packed plot. While the basic story is kept, many small details seem to have been needlessly changed. For those who don't know, The Four Feathers is supposedly about Harry Feversham, a man enlisted in the army. When Harry is informed he will be sent to war in the Sudan, he hides this information and quietly resigns from the army to be with his fiancé, Ethne. However, life with Ethne is soon changed when he receives three white feathers from his army colleagues. Explaining to Ethne what he has done and that the feathers are a symbol of cowardice do not help Harry; in fact, she tears a feather out of her fan to make four feathers. Harry then sets out to regain the lost respect of his friends through helping them, in an ultimate goal to regain the respect of Ethne.  For the most part, only minor details are changed from the novel to the movie; for example, the way that Harry's friend, Jack Durrance goes blind, or the fact that Harry disguised himself as a Greek, not as an Arab. The change that seems most prominent, however, is the fact that in the film, Jack Durrance knows of Harry's resignation from the beginning. This subverts the whole quest that Jack undertakes to find out the truth in the novel. In addition, the entire `battle' between the warden of the House of Stone of Omdurman and Harry and Abou Fatma was created solely for action value in the film. However, despite this addition of action, the movie still seems to drag at points.  Films are almost never completely accurate when following a novel; that is why they are only based on them. However, as I've said, a lot of the changes made seem senseless. I would recommend this film to someone who has not read the book or who does not mind liberal film interpretations of novels, if they have an hour or two to waste. Those looking for a movie to keep them on the edge of their seats would be advised to find something else. 
 The Apple Remote is included with the iMac G5 and works great with it and Front Row.  However, for the iPod, it's almost useless.  The lack of menu navigation capability using the remote is crippling.  In short, don't buy this remote, look at other non-Apple remotes that are more full-featured 
 Given the book is from Kathleen Jamieson I was a tad dubious the book would offer objective information. I've seen her commentary on PBS multipe times and she is a reliable spokesman for the Democrats. I thought perhaps the written word may provide her more latitude to provide alternate viewpoints, or at least express a more thorough examination of political issues than is possible in her tv clips. I could not have been more mistaken. The reviews on this page accurately describe most essays as dull, which they are. Anyone who is even remotely in touch with news sources outside of the Today Show is aware of the "sound bite" culture we live in, and the consistent disparity between public pronouncements of our elected officials and the telling details. Ho hum - we really don't need a dozen essays to tell us this. More telling would be a thorough examination of WHY this phenomenon persists, which requires more analysis of the news media which drive our political culture. Face it, most of what politicians do is performed with one finger in the wind, and that wind is largely blown from the network news studios. If they approve, then there is no problem; if they criticize and question, then our friend the politician has a problem. Preening on tv is the coin of the real for most politicians today, not the art of statecraft. The homogenous make-up of the news opinion leaders is proven left-leaning. Exhibit "A" is Walter Cronkite, once the most "trusted man in America" and now an outspoken liberal, who is also known for once saying in order to be a good journalist one HAD to be liberal. Have a look at the cumulative public and private pronouncements of Tom Brokaw, Jane Pauley (married to Gary Trudeau), Dan Rather, Judy Woodruff (married to the liberal Al Hunt), Peter Jennings, Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, Connie Chung, etc., etc., etc. They are all Democrat-friendly and critical of Republicans. When was the last time  you heard ANY network anchor express admiration for Ronald Reagan? Of course you have not, because it hasn't happened. This is why the book is a yawner, it is mostly liberal academics decrying the state of political discourse in this nation, but they can't point the finger at the culprits of chronic misinformation because they are, in fact, their liberal brethren in the main-stream news media. Why, I may ask, is the nation over 2 years removed from economic recession, yet nearly 50% of the country still believes we are in recession? Putting aside your feelings on the economy, the empirical fact is we are NOT in recession. This is an indictment of the news media, that the people are so terribly misinformed about something so important as the economic state of their country. They should be ashamed at their terrible reporting, but dont' bet a lobster on it. They are certainly proud, as they have somehow saddled a Republican president with the image of a bad economy in an election year. Clinton's economic numbers were not much better than Bush's, yet the media consistently trumpeted his handling of the economy (which was in strong growth when he came into office, and was in negative growth when he left). For a truly informative book on understanding the underpinnings of American political discourse, ignore this book and pick up "Amusing Ourselves to Death" by Neil Postman. It is neither liberal nor conservative, but the watershed work on how our basic cultural values limit what we are capable (collectively, not individually) of understanding about politics and the nation in general. Good times come and go, but stupid is forever. The title of Ms. Jamieon's book is as misleading as its contents, and the perfect embodiment of the empty-headed academic pseudo-insights we'd all benefit by avoiding 
 As a psychiatrist and person with mentally ill family members, I can only bemoan all of the misinformation contained in this book. The truth is that many of the mentally ill in America do not get the treatment they need precisely because they believe the things said in this book, on tv, etc. As someone who has lived outside of the US and in the developing world, I can tell you that their mental health treatment pales compared to what is available in the United States and is much more primitive and coercive. Although it is true that many psychiatric medications have serious side effects, the consequences of living with symptoms of a serious mental illness can only convince you of how devastating that can be to both the ill person and his or her family. Furthermore, as someone who is also experienced in administering ECT, I can personally attest to the wonderful success rate of this treatment for persons with severe depression who have failed all alternatives and who would rather be dead than live out their lives. (And many, unfortunately, do decide on death as a last resort).  As far as lobotomies, ice baths, and forced stays in hospitals or other facilities, these are things of the past in the United States. In fact, one of the biggest problems I face in my practice is the extreme difficulty I have in placing someone in the hospital when they actually need a brief stay (typical stays are 5-7 days) because of a lack of psychiatric beds ( more than 90% of psychiatric beds were eliminated from American hospitals in the last 15 years as a cost-cutting measure). The other problems faced by modern psychiatry still includes stigmatisation of the mentally ill and then all the more mundane issues such as needs for help with housing, employment, and job development. But I bet you wouldn't find the author writing a book about that 
 Anyone who argues that the infamous "band" An Angle is not a blatant ripoff of Bright Eyes is clinically insane. The person that argues "sImPLE PLAnnn and GoOd ChArloTTE sound the same OMGGZ that proves that bright eyes and an angle can sound the same and thats perfectley oK!!1111": are you seriously comparing those "bands" as being worthy of even being discussed in this conversation? Of course there will be bands that sound similar to them. Simple Plan is mainstream crap made for 13 year olds. As for bright eyes and elliott smith?! Are you serious? Do you listen to elliott smith? If you did, you'd know the song structures, sound of his voice, etc is entirely different from bright eyes. But not to drag on, "flicker of a cigarette", "did you, did you, did you", "like a locket like a necklace...". It is simply impossible for all of this to be a coincidence, as well as the sound of his voice (he's from Sacramento for god's sake, stop faking a Nebraskan accent), and the artwork. I hope this is a joke and if it is, I will just laugh along with whoever made it, because they did a damn good job. 
 I can't believe I wasted as much time as I did on this book.  This is perhaps one of the worst slap-together-a-story jobs in recent publication.  I was looking for a slice of NY life, and what I got was no Big Apple--just a rotten apple.  Does anyone want to buy my copy (only about 3/4 read and slightly vomit stained) 
 Clearly this product is overrated. In my opinion the book is a complete mess, with definitions, propositions and theorems mixed with the main text and not clearly evidenced from it.  It's funny, because the book uses a panoplia of bolds, italics, etc in the main text (well, there is only main text here) which I dislike and think is unnecessary, and then do not use it to evidence the important results. As a result I think this is probably the worst book that I can remember of for reference.  There are better books and it's almost impossible to get one worse than this one 
 This is the worst Asian movie that I have ever seen.  The story is dumb and doesn't make any sense, especially the ending.  And to top it off it isn't that scary - it only gets a little bit scary at the end.  My recommendation:  Don't get this movie.  It is also too expensive.  It you want to watch a good Asian horror movie, I have lots of recommendations.  Wishing Stairs is pretty good.  Koma is an excellent movie. A Tale of Two Sisters is pretty good. Good luck 
 Just received the German 4 disc digipak. GOOD NEWS. played 10 mins of both - no problems. Menus are all in English (or German) all the extra's on the English R2 SE's are here except for the photo gallery.  The sound is very good and the restored english mono is BETTER than the MGM 5.1 also on here with the commentary and German mono. The 5.1 sounds muddled compared to the mono which is strong and has good clarity and separation.  Picture. No problems I could see on my 6ft screen via InFocus 5700 projector from an Arcam FMJ-DV29 DVD player. Player is set to progressive playback and did not have to change anything.  Only watched first 10mins of each but doing A-B comparisons with the English R2 MGM SE's the German ones are noticeably better, they look less washed out, contrast is not set so high and colours are a lot more pronounced especially on Fistful, which is why I bought this set, but also on Few Dollars More as well.  They are also cleaned up a bit more as well as most importantly Few Dollars More is at last the full version, which no MGM DVD is worldwide..... 
 Take a "humourous" title, take one sentence (in this case : Don't take too much responsibility for things) and write an entire book about it - don't forget to include quotable phrases that mean nothing.  This is the perfect recipe for getting money out of the easiest (and most populous) demographic in America : the incompetent middle manager 
 This book as really good basic information, although most of the other information is obsolete.  Most texture artist(new or vetran) have surpassed this technology long ago.  It's great read for the basics, but beyond that, their are better books 
 Dear Film Company Jackasses,  Surely you know we already hate you for your greed - Why do you add insult to injury by taking fine films like "The Great Santini" and cutting them to Full Screen?  Yet another fine film marred, no doubt, by some big company's desire to cut corners. Burn, Hollywood, burn 
 This book is not by Kathy Reichs.  It is by Max Collins, but features Tempe Brennan.  I love Tempe Brennan - Kathy Reichs' forensic anthropologist.  Why she let this author use her character's name and some other characteristics is beyond me.  Here, the character and the story is flat, one-dimensional, linear and written poorly.  It's like a cheap knock-off that is obvious to all once you buy the book and begin reading.  What a disappointment.  
 The self-improvement books How to Win Friends and Influence People and Talking the Winner's Way are both way superior to this short book. Most of what you read is basically review if you've ready other similar books. And what's present doesn't pack enough substance or "how to" to make it really worth your time. About half-way through the book, Gabor started presenting fresh ideas. The problem, however, is that it was half-way through the book. Not a bad read, but there's so much better. If you happen across it one day on the street, it won't do any harm to read it. But I can't recommend paying money for something you already know, or can get for a better deal 
 THE WELLSPRING by Sharon Olds is representative of much of her poetry, which I characterize in the same way as the respected poetry critic Helen Vendler:  self-indulgent, sensationalist, and even pornographic.  It is bad enough that this book if full of sexually explicit acts, such as in the poems "Full Summer" "Early Images of Heaven" and "First" as well as many others.   In addition, the poet expresses her disrespect for life in the poem "Killing My Sister's Fish" in which she recounts the episode in which she poisons her sister's fish with ammonia, and does so in her own words "as if without regret."  I feel reverence for all life, no matter how great or small the creature, and was  greatly disturbed by this poet's attitute.  In short, I am thoroughly REPULSED by the poetry of Ms. Olds, and will communicate as much to all of my family, friends, and acquaintances.  Respectfully,  Catherine Ros 
 Levi was a political prisoner, a situation that would drive anyone to seethe, become negative, and cynical.  I read this book and it was clear to me that Levi was not in the most positive frame of mind.  He is relentlessly negative about his situation and the people he has come into contact with.    Did Levi ever find out that the "peasants", many of whom had lived in the United States in the early 20th century (and knew English) and had returned to Italy, later became indispensable to the Allied forces that liberated Italy?    I guess you can't blame a prisoner for "being negative", but man, it comes across loud and clear in his viewpoint and portrayal.  As his own writing indicates for all to read, he comes across as arrogant and condescending.  Did he hate the North, the nation of Italy, all Italians, as much as he hated the South?    I'd like to blame his writing on the fact that he was under duress, but somehow I get the feeling Mr. Levi would have had the same condescension no matter what his circumstance was. 
 We can't add anything to Christianity, there are no more Gospels.  Nothing that we need to add, no stories we need to tell, or make up to explain who God is or what He thinks.  It is all before us.  He's told His story, He's revealed His character, and His Truth through the bible.  Glenda's book, to me, is half-baked.  She even admits she is no theologian.  Maybe that's where she should start with the bible herself, instead of making up stories about her conversations with God that are not biblically sound and contradict the Truth of who He is.  She puts way too much emphasis on the individual.  She stressed throughout her book that "we" are love, If we are Love, then why do we need a Savior.  If we are perfect why did He send His son to die for our sins?  Glenda's book is not one of Christianity, it is philosophy.  Self help, not surrender to a higher power.  She is promoting herself, her work.  We don't need her telling us what He thinks, He already has.  We ourselves, can go directly to the source.  He layed Himself out to us, fully exposed.  No hypothesizing necessary from authors like Glenda.  
 too bad the description did not state this was a bottomless drawer, if it had i wouldn't have gone to (4) stores looking for it--finally found and bought(2). beautiful look but is NOT at all functional for me. now, i will return the (1) i built and the other which is still in the box :(  also, the screw for the knob was not the right one, had to find one of my own!! too bad! 
 I travel 2-3 weeks a month for work and I needed a hairdryer that was better than the 1000 watt hotel dryers, so after some research I decided to purchase the travel-size T3.   During the first time I used it, it started smoking and the coils in the back flared up and caught on fire. (There were actual flames -- although they quickly burned out)  I took the dryer back to Sephora and I was quickly given a replacement.  While I had dryer #2, I noticed that it took 15-20 minutes to dry my hair, when it usually takes 20-30. However, I have the full size T3 at home and it takes about 10 minutes when I use that one.  I was expecting this to offer the same power as the other T3.  The bottom line is that I didn't notice a big difference between the travel T3 and the hotel hairdryers that are built into the bathrooms.   After 6 months, the handle broke on the 2nd hairdryer making it rather challenging to use.   If you want a great hairdryer, buy a full size T3, Elchim or Chi Pro -- if you need something to travel with, you're better off with finding space for the full size model. 
 I honestly can't believe that the other two glowing reviews are for this book. They would more likely describe Jefferson's War which I recently read and enjoyed a good deal.   This book seems to be written by an academic elite who doesn't clearly describe the events of the time in overview. Instead he gives a cloudy and partial image of what was going on through a bunch of obscure, minor, news clippings and plays from the time. Worse, it's chopped up into several dis-joint chapters, each of which read like an essay by his grad students who are tyring too hard for an A, making up for a lack of research with a plethora of rambling analysis. If I hadn't read Jefferson's War which chronologically goes through the events I would have been completely lost reading this book.   If you want to learn the history of this time, with romance, action, adventure, exotic lands, swashbuckling, amazing and interesting facts thrown in, etc. read Jefferson's War. If you want to listen to an academic make convoluted pointless arguments -all the while passing modern judgement on the views and values of the time- then this is your book. The irony is that the author was audacious enough to put the word obscured in the title of his own book . . . 
 I agree a lot with Wolf's review of this book. It just dosent add up. I think that generally, people throw around the word Karma carelessly. Before your born, you choose the experiences you were going to have, the signigigant relationships, life mission etc. You choose the way your going to grow on your spiritual path. To write a book that says you can bypass this is misleading. However, I do believe there are certain cellular and DNA memories from past lives and current lives that CAN be released. I suggest others interested in Karma and other related books search for the Matthew books "Matthew tell me about Heaven" by suzy ward Botton line, nomatter what, your here to grow on this planet Earth, otherwise why would we come? I suggest others interested in Karma 
 ALL THE BEST SONGS ARE ON OTHER ALBUMS.  This is an audio recording from multi-media presentations.  Much of the material is geared around visuals and Anderson's stage personnae.  This is like listening to a television broadcast of a football game without the picture.  You get the general idea what is going on, but you miss a lot.  It is not like listening to a football game over the radio, where the broadcasters explain what you aren't seeing.  Without the visuals to go with this CD, many of the stories and jokes come up flat.    This CD set is about 4 and a half hours long.  It was taken from several years of Anderson's live shows that eventually became the United States.  Each CD more or less covers a specific "tour".  Her back up band changes from CD to CD.  You can tell that as time goes on, she gets more famous (and maybe has more money) she is able to add more to the shows (and her backup band gets bigger).  The sound quality is amazingly good.  It is sharp and crystal clear.  There is almost no audience noise, which does help create a good atmosphere for her stories.  About 80% of the material is spoken word.  There is some music.  It is probably less than 45 minutes of the total 4 and a half hour production.  The recordings come from early in her career.  She later redid most of the best material and put in on other albums.    I would suggest getting her other CD's.  Or if you want to see her performance art work, I would suggest searching out the Home Of the Brave VHS tape (I don't think it has been released on DVD).  Don't get the Home of the Brave CD 
 The author of the book said he wanted to go for aesthetically pleasing, but figured artists wanted more on visibility.  He would've done so much better going with his first choice!  I wanted a good book of poses, and have yet to get one picture out of the book!  Most of the poses in this book weren't pleasing to the eye at all.  The models are all young, thin people in ridiculous, often painful looking poses.  A little variety would've been great, too, and the two photos of pregnant women in there don't count for much.  There are no old people, fat people, or even normal sized people!  There are, however, an archive of the worst poses I've seen to date.  Do yourself a favor and go get a good book like Anatomy for the Artist by Sarah Simblet or Virtual Pose 2 by Mario Henri Chakkour.  You'll actually get some use out of them 
 I bought this book because I thought I'd relate with the author's choice of the title "The Best Little Boy in the World".  It took me less than fifty pages to realize that this was one of the worst books I've ever read.  I can imagine that this book probably made a lot of difference when it was written, but today, I like to think we've progressed beyond the self-loathing, hatred of our own nature, and belittling of anyone that isn't like us to make this book less relevant for today.  If I was recommending a book to a teenager to help them with their coming out process, I definitely would not recommend this book.  I mean, come on, coming out is traumatic enough as it is, why would I want to make it worse by suggesting they read a book that will only put them down and make them feel worse about themselves?    
 true to form and true to his evangelical christians supporters, Ibn Warraq again bring to us the hate and lies that made him so famous amongst the haters of Islam and Muslims.  the group (Warraq) are playing a dangerous game in this world of missionaries' geopolitical agenda.  
 I was very disappointed.  The one star I gave it is for the instrumental with the recorder, it was good.  I thought the rest was a very poor tribute to LOTR 
  An extremely convoluted read. Another reader mentioned "dizzying" and I concur. Chock full of psyco-babble and others' personal stories that I found uninspiring.  The numerous exercises Myss requires of you to dissect past emotional events, felt somehow unhealthy and too self-absorbing. How can one be objective about the dynamics of past painful events since our perspective of them can change dramatically with time?      The author's voice was to me that of a least favorite professor in college. You know, the one class you would nod off on occasion? I took alot of effort for me to get through the first lengthy chapter, which I did, indeed, fall asleep around page 83.     However, the bottom line for me was the lack of joy in the authors words. I found Myss overcomplicating, and over intellectualizing too many fundamental Spiritual practicalities and principles. This book would seem better off in "general psychology" and not in the "Self-help/improvement" section of the bookstore. The over-analytical process could be enough to send someone in crisis over the edge.    
 As a big fan of 70's Krautrock, I've been intrigued by the buzz surrounding Neu! in hipster circles these days.  They seem to enjoy a higher standing than excellent bands like Can, Popol Vuh and Kraftwerk, and my excitement increased when the cashier at the hip, indie-type record store practically gushed over my brilliant selection.  So I rushed home to listen to it and.....was completely underwhelmed to say the least.  This band has quite the cult following, who I'm sure will be hitting that "unhelpful" button, but I'm sorry.  I gotta call 'em the way I hear 'em.  The entire second half of this record consists of the band taking two (rather mediocre) songs and then playing them at the wrong speeds like little kids playing with their parents' stereo.  That's right, they actually recorded the songs being played at 16 rpm or 78 rpm or whatever, and expected people to both pay for and be entertained by it.  To me it's "experimentalism" at it's most pretentious and annoying (not to mention lazy-how about just writing some songs or something?)  The opening "Fur Immer" is actually a very nice encapsulation of the Krautrock sound, as Neu! lays down some interesting synth and guitar textures over a driving beat.  Unfortunately, the bass player's decision to play exactly one note throughout wears thin about halfway through the eleven minute running time.  "Lila Engel" is instructive as an influence on the post-rock movement.  Play this for any Mogwai fan and they'll instantly recognize the musical language.  Maybe I just picked the wrong introduction to the band.  Maybe Neu! and Neu 75 are better, but after blowing sixteen bucks on this one I'm not sure I'm in a hurry to find out 
 I'm a beginning db student, and this book is bad. Really bad. I'll just pick a few words that describe my experience with it: verbose, awkward, vague, anguishing...  Mine is now filled with handwritten corrections that our professor helped us add (I can't believe how many typos slipped through editing). Our whole class pretty much agrees that this book still needs some serious work before it could be considered publishing material. The university department chose this book based on Kroenke's excellent teaching and database reputation. However, it seems that he really has no idea of how to put together a good book. Something criticized in other reviews is the text's layout. I agree--it's horrendous. You are often reading about a diagram two pages back, or one page ahead. In fact, I'd say that, more often than not, when the illustrations are referenced, it is on a totally separate page. (Did that make sense?) Example: "Figure 4-5a shows how......." So you'll have to flip two pages back to see the illustration. Ugh! I normally love learning, but I really have to force myself to trudge through this drivel 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting Jackie Chan's movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way ENTIRE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 I'm a big fan of the Friday the 13th/Jason movies. I've moved into reading the new Jason X books. First one was direct from the movie and well done. The second one lagged and failed to focus on Jason so fell short of expectations (limited as they were, it is afterall a slasher book). This third one was so dismal it should be discontinued immediately.   First the "Planet of the Beast" takes place around the conveniently named Planet #666 which just happens to be the order in which humans discovered it in their search of planets; this in itself is utterly moronic. Second, "Jason X" is the name of the movie not the character however the author seems to insist that's the killer's name now. The mass of inconsistiencies shows the author did no research or possibly never even seen the Jason X movie. She repeatedly comments on Jason's pale cold blue eyes. Did she not even look at the cover photo for her book? Did anyone in editing not see the movie? Jason's eyes, after being transformed are a burning reddish orange, certainly not blue. The author writes about Jason's mouth which is non existant from the new mask. Most damaging (other than the eyes which bothered the crap out of me) is the repetitive statements regarding Jason's extremely fast speed. What??? Jason has never moved fast and even basing it off the Jason X movie, he moved no faster after transformation. Fourth, as another reviewer stated, Jason was a killer not a torturer. The mass amount of dismemberment was boring and nonsensical and was there for the 'gore purpose' only and it falls completely short of that, again hinging on moronic. The author didn't even attempt to explain how Jason revives on Planet #666.  For all my ranting, here is the summation of my view... in short, this book seemed to have been written by a 12-year old and is just simply abysmal. The author didn't care about the book or subject matter, the author had no clue about the subject matter, and the editing was terrible (just the amount of typoes and grammar was disgraceful for any book). I don't expect much from a book based on "Friday the 13th" but I do expect the author to show some ingenuity and/or reasoning in their work.  Even as a fan, you shouldn't read this book. This book doesn't even deserve a 1/4 star for a rating 
 The house a 2 dimensional cut sheets of plastic with an image only on one side.  The train can only really be pulled and not pushed because the car behind the engine has a different kind of link that makes it awkward to push.  Everything else is standard Brio.  If you decide to buy this, you definately want to get the North Pole set with the Christmas tree as it makes a wonderful sound.  
 Walter Mosley, like too many mainstream and mystery writers, appears to believe that "science fiction" means "logic and plausibility get tossed out the window." That the official Amazon.com review compares this book to the work of Philip K. Dick is amazing and wrong-headed; Dick knew how to ground his surrealism in the real world and especially in real human beings. Whatever Mr. Mosley does in his mysteries and mainstream fiction, that's not what he's doing here 
 This collection of self-aware, music snob drivel is not completely about rock stars who kill themselves. Sure, that is a flimsy thread that the author goes back to every so often, but make no bones about it - this book is about an irrelevant person's relationships. This is only the 3rd book I've ever thrown away without finishing, and that's saying a lot.  I bought this book at an airport thinking "hey, I love music; I love pop culture; I love roadtrips...why not?". I put it down after 20 pages after the author quickly abandoned the premise of the book (the one marketed on the cover) and went off on a tangent about some relationship with some girl. I came back to it about 3 weeks later, ready to give it another shot. Two more relationship stories and 70 pages later I decided I was bamboozled and tossed it away. I just don't care about the author enough to be concerned about the one that possibly got away or the one that could never be.   Put it this way, if the book was marketed as a story of a man and his 3 tortured relationships you most likely wouldn't buy it.  He also is one hell of a music snob, throwing in some of the most obscure music references to make sure you know he knows his music. Add in that "Kid A" diatribe he went on, labeling the album as a phrophecy to 9/11 - an intentional reach of a theory. I haven't seen such stretching of lyrics since Nostradamus' words were transcribed.  Stay away from this clunker 
 The first Crow Film, including plot, eventually evolved from Brandon Lee's death.  The first film was going to include the Skull Cowboy from the Comic.  The Power of the crow could not be stolen from him by hurting the bird.  This is a Testimate to how all of the films after the first have failed.  This film and 2-3 tried to build on a story line that was never supposed to be and should not have been.  As seen by their success.  The movie The Crow was amazing, and made so by Brandon's performance along with his supporting cast.  I admit some of the scenes filmed after his death were cheesey, and that the actors did not seem, AT ALL, very thrilled to do them.  All of that a side.  You can't build on the accident that made the first film.  They should have starting with Part 2, tried to stick with the original story, and maybe, just maybe, they could have made the wrong this right 
 My son got this as a birthday present.  After taking quite a while to set up, with several of the cheap and flimsy sticks breaking, the game lasted but a few minutes.  Since no one wanted to take the time to set it up again, it got tossed.  Save your money!  Buy Blink! 
 I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me! Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT! Yes "wacky artist" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages! Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter! WE KNOW! Don't tell us 100 times! This is what I think: Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...OR she's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing. Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work? Also, is it cold stone sober? Or STONE COLD SOBER? (it should have been the latter) No editor caught that mistake?  I've been a fan of Ms. Steel's work for 21 years now and the past few year's works have been deplorable! I first excused it due to the death of her son.. But her talent never picked up again. From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff. If you want to read a novel and not think about what you're reading...then read her books, this one especially. If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky, Luanne Rice, Alison Clement, Susan Wiggs..

 Pages 1-40 disclose some background information relating to patents.  Here, the author is plainly uncomfortable with the topic. Pages 41-107 describe various regulations relating to FDA submissions.  Here, the writing is somewhat more assured.  On page 14, the author states that "claims tend to get long winded because for some reason lost in the mists of time, there can only be one sentence in each claim, so that [sic] sentence sometimes gets very long."  This is false.  A basis for single sentence claims is the Patent Act of 1836, but also in a publication from July 1836 called "Information to Persons Having Business to Transact at the Patent Office."    On page 15, the author states that the Seaborg claim is a broad claim.  This is false.  The Seaborg claim is a species claim (a narrow claim).  The Seaborg claim is NOT a genus claim (genus claims are broad claims).    On page 15, the author states that "the broadest patents have the shortest claims."  This is not really true.  The author forgets that certain extra words, such as "comprising" or "or", are universally used to broaden claims.   Again, the author might have described how "comprising language" is used to broaden claims.  The author also might have explained how "or language" is used to broaden claims.   But nothing is said about these techniques for broadening claims.  Note also that what can be broad is a CLAIM in a patent, not the patent itself.  From the writing, the reader might infer that the SPECIFICATION determines whether a patent's coverage is broad or narrow.  But this is not the case.  An author writing for a novice audience should not be using careless phraseology in referring to established, clearly defined concepts.  On page 16, the author tries to describe the Doctrine of Inherency, giving the example of a mechanism of action of a drug.  This is a confusing example, because there are really two issues going on in this example: (1) Inherency; and (2) Failure to satisfy the utility requirement (35 USC 101).  This is also a bad example because often, when faced with a discovery relating only to mechanisms, the patent attorney might draft a claim reading, "A method to detect this mechanism" or "A method to stimulate this mechanism."  For the claim given by the author, when written by an attorney to read "A method to detect this mechanism" or "A method to stimulate this mechanism," only utility is an issue (inherency would no longer be an issue).  The author should have used the much better example found in a case from the Federal Circuit, In re Cruciferous Sprouts.  On pages 18-19, the author attempts to explain novelty, utility, and non-obviousness.  However, the author only mentions the statute 35 USC 103, and fails to mention 35 USC 102 (novelty) or 35 USC 101 (utility).  At this point, it is becoming clear that the "book" is unusually disorganized and inaccurate.  On page 23, the author states that "A patent is a sword, not a shield. . ."  This is false.  As soon as a patent is filed, it becomes a powerful shield, as it can become prior art under 35 USC 102(e), preventing the allowance of U.S. patents, e.g., of competitors.  Morever, as soon as a patent application is published, it also becomes a shield, preventing the allowance European patents, e.g., of a competitor.   On page 28, the author tries to explain the "Function, Way, Result" test.  But what a mess the author has made.  The author writes, ". . . it might infringe under the doctrine of equivalents because your gizmo has an element that performs a similar function by similar means in a similar way . . ."  What happened to "Result"?   Where is "Result"?  Where?  The author is further confused here, because he uses the term "means."  In patent law, the term "means" is used to invoke 35 USC 112, paragraph six.  The term "means" should not be used when initiating an explanation of the Doctine of Equivalents.  Another mess.   On page 31, the author writes, "This is called prosecution history estoppel if you really wanted to know."  This type of comment is excessively informal, and is not appropriate for a "book" on patent law.  On page 89, the author states that "The FDA recently approved a combination of two well-known cholesterol lowering statins giving new life to Merck's Zocor by combining it with a newer statin sold by Schering-Plough."  This is false.   The compound of Schering-Plough is Zetia.  But Zetia (Ezetimibe) is not a statin.  This "book" contains only about 30,000 words.  This is the length of a typical law review article.  At $25.00, this tiny "book" is no bargain.  The production could be better.  While the quality of the glossy cover is excellent, the ink in my copy of the book is smeared on pages 34, 49, 88, 105, and 108.  Citations for cases, and the names of cases, are missing (pages 51, 66, 71, 74).   This "book" contains way too many errors in its attempts to describe various issues in patent law.  For this reason, this "book" deserves zero stars 
 No need to write a review. Just look at the title.   Well, okay, I'll write a small review. Not only is most of it misspelled (I think it's supposed to be: "Get Crunk Who You With: The Album", but that could be open to punctuation), but even with proper grammar it doesn't make a lick of sense. That should tell you right off the bat it's "meeeyooooozzzzikkk" for morons. Who the hell takes this guy seriously anyway? Can you believe this crap is on the same charts that Led Zeppelin were on 35 years ago?!?! Scary...  Now it's time for the inevitable swarming of "Not Helpful" votes from rich wiggers and pre-teen girls. Oh, joy. Oh, pure ecstasy. Oh for the love of Norman Rockwell and the Lettermen 
 The seller made a mistake and did not have the title in stock. They had later sent me an e-mail apologizing for the error and credited my account. 
 The only reason I am rating this book a 1 is to get my father's attention - Matthew Henry "Jake" Jacobson. I have not seen or heard from you in 10 years. Hope you are enjoying your travels in Cambodia more than you enjoyed your daughter 
 If only they'd put as much effort into sound processing as they do the computer graphics, this would be a great disc.  As it is, it sounds like a bootleg-quality ripoff made from a videotape.  At least someone could've flipped on the Dolby switch.  Perhaps they're saving that for the "remastered" edition 
 This book takes advantage of the fear of being hacked by presenting the reader with a ton of paranoid, poorly written information. So many books before this one have approached network security in a much better manner. I've found so many mistakes in this book, or critical omissions, that I finally stopped reading it 
 I was livid at the author's underestimation of the intelligence of the American consumer and investor.  With his ludicrous assertion that the US and the world economy and the value of currency should be limited by the arbitrary supply of a yellow metal is ridiculous and has been pilloried for more than a half century by actual economists.  His arguments to support his conclusions are so fraught with logical fallacies, any senior high school debator could rip it apart.  His fundamental lack of understanding of debt-backed securities is frightening as is his assertion that the US Government controls the money supply and the whimsical printing thereof.  For someone who lambastes with such slavering scorn, the Federal Reserve Bank of the US, I'm surprised he hasn't actually realized that the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 privatized monetary policy decisions in the US to prevent the federal government's capricious issuing of currency.  In addition, if you're going to take on John Maynard Keynes and Alan Greenspan, it would help to have a solid litany of proof, rather than scattered and fragmented anecdotal evidence that spans perhaps 6 fiscal quarters at best.  Also, when explaining the beginning and end of trends, especially referring to the recent rise in gold prices, cite actual data and genuine trends.  Any novice at Excel could plot the points you gave and realize that the trend started well before the 2001 recession. Throwing up a graph and misrepresenting its data further impugns the author's credibility and his "agenda."  Furthermore, Mr. Wiggin, as  a follower and commentator on the currency markets, the dollar is down only against the euro--hardly a "demise."  All other currencies in the world, peg themselves to the dollar because of the US's robust economy.  Eastern European and other black markets deal in dollars.  Perhaps you should take Macroeconomics 101 again and refresh your memory on the concept of debt-backed securities, get a tutor to explain Keynes and write something that will do more than foment hysteria and promulgate misinformation and wild unsubstantiated conclusions.  And--return America to an beleaguered economy manufacturing expensive goods with that no one else wants to buy (think GM and its overwrought pension fund)--what are you thinking?  It would be nice to see a relevant observation with a logically sound conculsion.  Wiggin completely disregards the (Growing) portion of US GDP that is a direct result of services and entertainment and bemoans--in Jeremiah fashion--that doom is imminent because manufacturing's share of the GDP is declining.  His right-wing, Bo-Gritz-for-president, unsubstantiated diatribe may be gospel at a Libertarian mass meeting, but his economic sturm-und-drang just doesn't pass academic or serious financial scrutiny.  While Americans are heavy spenders and should save more, it's a perilous leap in logic to assume that the economy itself on the verge of collapse. Perhaps Wiggin should consult Moody's and Standard and Poors for a primer on the term "creditworthiness." I'm far more open to a study of the legitimate problems with the US economy--inflation, the transfer of wealth from manufacturing to services, or even the disappearance of the middle class.    All in all, Wiggin refuses to acknowledge the single, saving grace of a falling dollar--American goods and services cost less abroad--and more people consume what we have to offer.  An abysmal disappointment. Nothing more than a peurile rant from a two-bit charlatan. 
 I didn't really care about the characters nor the love story.  The implied passion was just that, more implied than revealed through the actions of the characters.  I was excited when I picked this book and disappointed when I finished it because my expectations were high.  Maybe too high.    Do not read the introduction which spoils the conclusion of the novel.  Just a heads up 
 This is my first review and I am writing it because I am compelled to let others know that this is not a good product.  I spent at least 10 hours trying to configure the device and at least one of those hours was spent on the phone with Linksys.  I have experience with networking and quite simply this device does not work as intended.  I was able to get it to work for periods of time but it stops after 5 minutes or so, or, I have to reconnect.  Don't waist your time or money on this 
 As many books the beginning of this one is excellent. But as you go over and over it gets boring and boring. The book has four stories that at the end will meet and all of them are stark boring. And at the end... just skip it. Better'd be if you skip this book 
 This is a dreadful book.  Didn't the writer do ANY research on Bosnia? When I got to the part where she said that describing the Bogomil philosophy was critical to understanding the mass rapes in 1992 and 1993, I  nearly tossed the book in the trash.  The Bogomils were a medieval  religious sect that died out in the 1500s.  Recent scholarship has  questioned not only their influence, but also whether the Bosnian nobles  were even Bogomils in the first place.  The writer relies on a single  interview with a seemingly distraught woman, she quotes extensively from  the interview and decides that understanding this obscure theology is a  useful tool for her readers.  Maybe if she'd done the research instead of  quoting someone she felt sorry for, the book would be better 
 This is a mindless book with no substance.  It is amazing how people can make money selling such meaningless nonesense.  This material is not original...just a bunch of quotes.  This is not at all helpful for customer service.  Dont waste your money 
 I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.  I feel like the characters have lost their voices.  The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books.  Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books.  I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone.  I tried to start the next book, and it was worse.  Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series.  
 I never quit reading books. I could see how this story would be confusing and hard to understand. I was able to keep up with the reading and understand it, but it was just plain boring. This book I just wasn't into. I didn't look foward to reading it. So I didn't finish it. Morrison jumped around to much.. once I started getting familiar with characters, she would switch it up. I don't know how it ever ended, but I wasn't patient with the book to find out 
 This is the worst DVD I have ever purchased! What a waste of money! I thought this would be like a VH1 "Behind The Music", but instead this DVD looks like amateurs threw it together and put it up for sale -- I could have made a better DVD of Britney on my computer! Unless you want to waste your time and money, do yourself a favor, and don't buy this piece of crap 
 I just finished listening to as much of the book on CD as I could stomach.  The minutia and lack of knowledge of police terminology and tactics was nauseating.  The words forhead, perp, peruse, crim, and finger were repeated over and over and over.  What might have been a good story in half the words was ruined by descriptions of everyone's clothing, spouses, children, and thinking 
 I am an RN student and this is the worst textbook I have had.  The ideas in it are really scattered, so it is difficult to find anything in it.  The chapters are extensive, for no reason and with minimal content 
 I bought this watch for work to time a 2 min procedure.  I found the 30 sec sweep hard to get used to.  I'm used to a 60 sec sweep. And the minute hand was difficult to read.  I really had to check to see if I was at 1.5 min or 2.5 min. 
 It is typical of our marginally educated educators in this country to bungle their research. Carnoy's book is an example. They make absolute comparisions of student proficiencies after controlling for the some of the demographic and socio-economic effects but in so doing they leave out the most important factor of all: How did the students compare with their regular public school cohorts when they entered charter schools? Perhaps lost to these ed-researchers is the fact that charter schools attract low performers compared to the public school alternatives. The real measure of a quality school is not children's absolute performance, but how much do they improve year over year. On that measure, charter schools are signficantly superior to their regular public school counterparts. 
 Nice compact box, and recording quality better than I expected.   One major flaw though, no preview when recording 640x480 resolution, just a black screen with 'REC' in the top corner.  Dropping back to 320x240 resolution doesn't help, this just displays the video preview in a tiny letter-box in the center of the display.  A real shame, I love the concept, but the lack of preview is a real problem.   Technical support claims that a future firmware upgrade will fix it, I'll keep my fingers crossed, but don't have high expectations 
 I was so disappointed in this version! I have a "Joy" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist. It doesn't act as a foundation for cooks -- it assumes you already know everything! PLUS, despite my not using it very often, the binding came apart and pages came out (after less than two years.) Find an old "Joy" on ebay and you'll be happier 
 This is great looking watch at a good price but very heavy.  I am unable to wear this watch with activities like golf and tennis. 
 The author's monosyllabic vicabulary utterly deadens what was an extremely interesting film. He adds no philosophy to the complexities, and adds very little in the way of plot. It reads like something one of the soulless Strangers might have written: devoid of joy, interest, creativity, and heart 
 I received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas.  The chest is beatiful and will be great for future use; however, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea.  Although the bags are highly aromatic, the tea is very bland, as if the bags were old. I am sure Bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty, just not the box I received. 
 I don't have academic training on philosophy argument and thus the book becomes a long and winding essay that is difficult to grasp.  You can read the first chapter from http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7749.html and see if this is the kind of books you would like 
 I went through an entire box in two days!  The fill with milk in no time and have to be changed constantly.  Plus, the diameter of these are much smaller than any others.  Try Gerber or Lansinoh 
 On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the illustrious Ms. Cornwell?  Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly.  However, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  For such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans throughout.  Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ."  Are you kidding me?  The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must WORK in one of the houses.  The author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy.  Read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.   DY 
 The set-up was easy and the bikes were easy enough to load, but when used in a 2-in. hitch it wobbles like crazy!  I was a nervous wreck just driving across town watching our bikes sway 45 degrees on every right turn.  I had a neighbor who knows alot about bike racks look at it and he said it was assembled right, but it's just not that tight in a 2 inch hitch.  
 This book is so bitter.  It repremands a learning improvisor on the very thing they should be trying, experimentation.  It trys to enforce it's view of an artform that is often open to interpretation.  I used to love this book until I realized it's just another name dropping text trying to masqerade as an authority on improv.  I recommend trying Mick Napier's Improvise or Keith Johnstone's Impro instead.  They realize that there is very little room for the term 'don't' in improvosation.  Truth in Comedy is just another example of the politic laden ImprovOlympic machine that makes Charna Halpern money and doesn't pass on any of the profit to the performers working for her.  To buy this book is to contribute to a corrupt system.  Don't get suckered in like myself and many others 
 Written in the sixties, this book wants to show how the middle age was dark, poor and uncivilized. Duby writes well, but his feeling about this period empeaches him to be honnest and to see the quality of certain things, like carolingian administration for instance.  Duby wrote this essay to show how dark was the society before the 13th century, before "le temps des cathedrales" on which he did a better work.. 
 This book is a great stepping stone for understanding.  But considering the Occam's Razor Theory; "the simplest explanation is the best"  I feel simply that understanding Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs is a better source to understanding your childrens needs, or anyones for that matter.  Being that our primary purpose in life is to be successful leaders of service to others.  By clearly understanding the role we are in, knowing what actions to be successful to DO, and implementing a system in the home to cover all 4 primary needs of our children, then we will automatically cover any areas of possible "temperement hinderings" in others.  To achieve the above, I reccommend the Bible.  The book by Hal Urban, available here at Amazon.com titled Lifes greatest lessons.  20 Things That Matter (to know the 8 things that sucessful people do).  And refining revising and rennovating our habits to revolutionize the impact we have on society through this lost art called "A Family". Confucius stated; "The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home"  I say...Duh!! 
 Have you heard?  Many Christians are seeking authentic Christian church life.  And they are leaving the institutional church (i.e. the religious buildings, empty pagan rituals, professional staff members, etc.) to experience it!    This I applaud.  Many Christians would do well to read "Pagan Christianity" by Frank Viola.  The institutional church is not the model given to us by the apostles.  And please know... I grew up a Southern Baptist and was on the ministerial staff for 6 years.  This conclusion was not all that easy to embrace.  However, I did discover it to be true.  Most truth loving people recognize the institutional church doesn't bring the results we see in the book of Acts. (e.g. read "Church Planting Movements" by David Garrison, published by the International Mission Board)  Yet, many are not willing to leave the comfortable confines of the man-centered institution to discover real ekklesia.  So... why did I rate this book so poorly if I am a part of a "house church" myself?  Because this book dishes out church in homes like it was fast-food!  Tony and Felicity Dale seem like wonderful people who have seen some great things happen in homes, but it would seem their method of starting churches is not founded in the N.T.  First, they use a proof-text (Matt.18:20) to establish the existence of a church.  A true church is a group of believers in a particular locality who have joined together in community for the purpose of gathering around Jesus Christ. (e.g. read "The Normal Christian Church Life")  A church is not just getting a couple of Christians together and doing a bible study or singing some songs. This idea is a really popular strand of "house church" that has many rushing out prematurely to do this.  These people have no real solid foundation and knowledge of the roles and workings of an apostle(church planter), prophet, pastor/teacher, etc.  In chapter 10 "IT'S OK TO START A CHURCH," the Dales encourage you to nonchalantly go out and find someone who will allow Christians to meet in their home and walla!  You will have a "house church".  Question: is this the model in Acts?  Go read it.  The Dales even admit from their experience that the life of many a "house church" does not last very long.  Why?? I believe it is because "Simply Church" is so simple it is not biblical.  If you believe that the church gathering in homes apart from the religious systems of man is what Christ and the apostles intended, then you must believe there is an order to things.  (e.g. Eph. 4:11)    However, if you believe church is a "cell group" or some other kind of alternative fellowship to the insitutional church... I imagine you can do whatever you want.  And many do.  Unfortunately, these "house churches" usually do not last.  Why would you want to trade one wrong practice (the institutional church) for another (house church as alternative)?  It is not an alternative.  It is the model given by the apostles to the community of saints.  We must be careful we do not trade one man-centered institution that meets in a building for another man-centered instituion that meets in a home!  Remember-- Real Christian church life comes by gathering around Jesus Christ in the order of the New Testament.  T. Austin Sparks puts it this way, "The church is measured by Christ: more Christ, more church; less Christ, less church."  The simplicity is found in gathering around Christ with a New Testament understanding of who we are and how we are to function within a local community of believers.  A biblical "New Testament" church comes about by a group of believers gathering around Christ the Head of the body.    The journey that you embark on in a true church... I believe can be represented in a picture.  It is a picture of believers hand-in-hand circled around the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.  This community is singing, encouraging, rebuking, correcting, and edifying for the worship of the one in the center:  Jesus Christ, the lamb who was slain!  Don't get hung up on mimicking the "first-century style" of church... be consumed with Christ!  Place him in the center.  In time... you will discover your church life is authentic.  I highly recommend you read the writings of Frank Viola if you are interested in gathering around Jesus and experiencing the freedom of the first-century church.  His book set is very helpful for those who seek to model Christianity in Acts.  He references his claims to Scripture.  Frank Viola's set: 1. "Rethinking the Wineskin: The Practice of the N.T. Church" 2. "Who is Your Covering: A Fresh Look at Leadership, Authority, & Accountabiltiy" 3. "Pagan Christianity: The Origins of Our Modern Church Practices" 4. "SO YOU WANT TO START A HOUSE CHURCH?: First-Century Styled Church Planting For Today" 5. "From Nazareth to Patmos: The Saga of the N.T. Church"  I also recommend reading: "Paul's Idea of Community: The Early House Churches in their Cultural Setting" by Robert Banks "The Normal Christian Church Life" by Watchman Nee "Life Together: The Classic Exploration of Faith in Community" by Dietrich Bonhoeffer "God's Ultimate Passion" by Frank Viola "The Untold Story of the New Testament Church" by Frank Viola * "The Release of the Spirit" by Watchman Nee 
 This and Mad Jack were stunning dissappointments.  Where are the fiery heroines, the ones with true pluck and spirit?  Why do all of Coulter's females become bedridden at some point?  What happened to the mystery?  There was nothing fresh about this novel.  The relationship is missing the brilliant spark that is so enchanting in many of her previous works--it seems lately Coulter is marrying off her couples earlier and earlier.  This story has been done to death by Coulter.  Try the "Song" series or the early Sherbrooke brides 
 The Influetials is either just a big statistical blob or I missed something.  Keller et al start out by describing the influential as someone who other people in the community kind of look toward.  They are very socially connected and respected.  There is no doubt in my mind that the proposition that one in ten people has a huge influence on how the other nine think, however instead of exploring the social patterns Keller et al try to define that person whom they call an "Influential"  They begin by saying in the first chapter that statistics can't pinpoint an influential and then spend most of the book tossing statistics on influentials at the reader - lots of tables that don't tell me anything.  One thing that I found interesting were the case studies scattered through the book.  Basically these were mini-biographies of influentials slanted more towards what they were up to at the moment.  Even these weren't all that helpful.  I recommend skipping The Influentials.  The title is really good but the book doesn't focus or do much to back it up.  Actually things just get muddled.  The Tipping Point by Malcome Gladwell has a good bit of discussion about who influences opinions and how.  Check that out instead 
 I returned this item on October 16, 2006, and have not received any refund to date.  How long does it take to receive a refund?  The book is probably very good, but it wasn't what I was looking for.  Joanne Cohe 
 I am just beginning to read this book.  I just opened it and began reading the first tutorial.  It wants me to import a file into my flash 5 project from the CD-ROM that comes with the book.  I look into the contents of the CD...nothing!  The file "forest.gif" isn't even on the CD!  Just by the looks of it, it doesn't look like this book will be very good.  I mean, I just now started it!  To me, this is embarrasing to the authors.  Be careful what you buy folks.. 
 . While the author attempts to appear even-handed by emphasizing her efforts in analyzing what she terms as "the Turkish view," it is crystal clear she did not approach the matter with a scholarly perspective. Housepian Dobkin has no purpose other than demonstrating that the Turks were guilty.   It's amusing the way she tries to play innocent by writing that she was "puzzled" that "a few" critics had found her book "highly charged" or "subjective." (When Dobkin cherishes fiercely anti-Turkish sources such as Dadrian and Hovannisian, how in the world could she possibly be objective?)  For example: she herself writes, "Mesopotamia's oil-rich lands were all this time under British military occupation." That explains it all; the British had laid claims to these oil-rich lands via secret treaties during the war. Oil was Britain's war booty all along. So Dobkin's attempts to make it seem like the Allies were being nice to the Turks for reasons of oil, when the Turks no longer had control of these lands, are very hollow.  An American who had changed his mind over Turkish excesses pointed out that to force foreign powers to control the treatment of minorities in Turkey would be "similar to foreign powers having insisted after our revolution on inserting a clause to the effect that we protect the American Indians," an argument that Dobkin finds "not only strained but absent-minded." Far from it; outside forces have no business in dictating the affairs of a sovereign nation, yet Dobkin expects that Turkey should strangely be exempt from this rule.   She also complains about "the missionaries who had discredited their own eyewitness testimonies," and others like Arnold Toynbee who had done an about-face from their former propagandistic views. Dobkin does not even consider the possibility that the former tellings of these partisans could have been false. (Toynbee was part of the British war propaganda division, for example.)  The author had already made up her mind on the guilt of her accused, and was strictly interested in finding sources to prove her case. A historian who wishes to arrive at real truth needs to consider all the sources. But as even one of her fans here pointed out, Housepian Dobkin is no historian. (Llacko, July 25, 2000) Dobkin made her case by referring to, as Llacko put it, "first hand quotes, at length, from people who were actually there."  Yet there were people who were actually there with no reason to defend the Turks, whose first hand quotes Dobkin purposely left out or de-emphasized. This was highly unconscientious of her. Her purpose is the same as some of the equally questionable reviewers here, who seem to have no use for the truth. They have their prejudices, and all they desire is to perpetuate their agenda. One can see this from the way in which they uniformly pile on the negative ratings on reviews that go against their ingrained beliefs.  One reviewer (Omer "aok34," Aug. 1, 2005) who provided a taste of what these other parties had to say offered arguments that are are hard to dispute. The city's fire chief, a foreigner (Paul Grescovich) who was in the best position to know the goings on knew that the Armenians and Greeks were behind the fire. Why would Dobkin treat this as though it meant nothing? (She only referred to this testimony in her bibliography.) Grescovich had no reason to defend the Turks.   Then there is the American special representative to the Near East Relief, an organization meant to help the Armenians, and not known for its friendliness to the Turks. Mark Prentiss was there, and he was spectacularly honest in his reporting. Prentiss had no reason to love the Turks; he was strictly and only interested in reporting the truth.   At this writing, reviewer Omer only has 3 of 14 stars. It must be asked of the people who went out of their way to give a negative rating, why would they wish to perpetuate a falsehood in the face of irrefutable truth?  Omer asks why would a nation burn down its own city, especially when the rest of the nation lay in ruins. Indeed, why would they? Think about the logic: If the Greeks displayed a record of leaving a scorched earth policy during their retreat, how could these reviewers not bother to consider the actual incentive the Greeks had and constantly demonstrated, aided by the Armenians of the city? (The Greek priest Chrysostomos was overheard instructing his flock that it was their religious duty to set the city on fire. He was among the casualties, and as Dobkin footnoted, a French admiral felt the priest deserved his fate. Dobkin referred to the priest's individual death as a "massacre," by the way.)  As for the worth of the firsthand testimony Dobkin provides, an article written by Prentiss for the Atlantic Monthly in Jan. 1924 gives us deep understanding. The foreigners were so inundated by "evil Turk" propaganda - not unlike many of the reviewers here, it seems - that they actually claimed to have witnessed atrocity events that never took place. Repeat: they didn't purposely lie; they were actually imagining things. Prentiss wrote that he must have encountered a hundred such made up tales:  "It was too much for a good many men - and not weaklings by any means. They were like children, who fail to distinguish between what they imagine or expect and what they really see. It is possible for an idea lo be so vividly present to the mind that it passes for fact on that ground alone."  And let's not forget there was no shortage of bigots who hated the Turks on account of their race and religion. The U.S. consul at Smyrna, George Horton represented a fine example. He would actually go on to pen a hateful book called "The Blight of Asia." In his opinion, the entire Turkish race was a "blight." Yet this racist is one of Dobkin's most beloved "eyewitnesses." (Diplomats generally did not check matters out firsthand, relying instead upon what others had told them.)  When I look at some of the reviewers here, I see the same kind of blind prejudice. Dianne Foster, for example, tries to come off as impartial at the start of her June 12, 2002 review. And then she goes off to make unthinking propagandistic claims like 2 million Christians fleeing after Smyrna [is she referring to the resulting post war population exchange between Greece and Turkey as "fleeing"?], gives a glowing nod to the propagandistic film "Ararat," and then admits her genocide sensitivities (with Smyrna making "Kosovo look like a picnic"), allowing her to easily buy into the claims of what Foster insists is a "scholarly" work. She actually believes there are over 200,000 people in "quay" illustrating the cover of the book. The nearest year Smyrna statistics were available was 1918, showing 65,000 Greeks and Armenians [Dobkin wrote the Armenian portion was no more than 20,000], and 114,000 Turks. (Along with 50,000 foreigners and 21,000 Jews, for a total of 250,000.) How could there possibly be 200,000 poor Christians awaiting their demise?  The reason why "neutrals" like Foster can accept the claims of horrible propaganda is because they have a built-in disposition to believe the worst of the Turks... as a result of the continual bombardment of hatred from certain ethnic groups who make it their business to perpetuate this hatred. This is why they similarly make it their business to write reviews here with no consideration for real truth.   Note, for example, the Feb. 6, 2004 offering of Kallya Georgiades, who offers the following incredible "logic": "If you don't believe in the massacre of Smyrna and the massacre of Constantinople why should anyone believe in the Jewsih Holocaust?" (Dobkin tells us of an author, Michael Llewellyn Smith, who believes in the guilt of the Turks, and of a total casualty of 1-2,000 resulting from the fire. Is this "massacre" to have equal weight with the Holocaust? And what is this mysterious "massacre of Constantinople"?) What drives these poor souls is an intense emotionalism, not clear-minded reason. That is why they will make a point of giving negative ratings to reviews in opposition to their beliefs, regardless of the truth therein.  A quick note regarding Smirnaios claiming "it was TURKEY that invaded Cyprus." (Apr. 25, 2005) Yes, and it was an Athens court that found the action legal, based on the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee, in place mainly to counteract massacres committed by the Greek Cypriot majority. Same pattern as with "Smyrna" and the "Armenian Genocide": the Greeks and Armenians begin an aggression, and when the aggression is answered, the biased world will not care about the events that brought on the response; only the end result will be pointed to, exaggerating the tales of villainy, so that blame will always fall upon the Terrible Turk.  
 I usually only feel compelled to write reviews for books that move me. Well, this one certainly did--to the bathroom to THROW UP! This insultingly unintelligent book is chock-full of every cliche known to man (or should I say woman). From leg-humping dogs to French dreamboats, The Botox Diaries is about as cleverly written as a fart joke. As an avid reader, I try to finish a book even if I don't like it. Well, there is an exception to every rule! What a waste of time 
 This book is beautfully illustrated.  And that is the only good thing I have to say about it.  It is a terribly negative book. Everything is "don't do this, don't do that!"  Babies like to splash in the bathtub, and it is joyful to watch them play, but in this book the baby is told not to splash in the tub.  Ditto for stopping to smell the flowers: "Don't be so slow, baby!"   My toddler loves looking at the pictures in this book and saying "please, baby, please", but we have changed the tone entirely, and most of the words so that this book is not negative and unpleasant 
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 As fair as studies aids go, this one is not very good. While concise and simple, the book really lacks the aid aspect. This book is like buying a textbook and reading it. In addition, I felt it times it wasn't very useful. I would read the UCC (especially 2-207) material and feel like I wasn't any better off than when I left class. I would buy instead the Emmanuel's and/or the Emmanuel Flash Cards if you want a stronger study aid. Unlike those additions, this book lacks the useful charts and acronyms that help when you're trying to remember the series of questions to ask yourself on the exam. In essence, if you are going to buy only one guide, and you don't need a second textbook, don't buy this one. However, if you haven't been going to your first year classes this is a good book to buy 
 ok for cornbread but NOT at all for scone 
 This book was a real disappointment. There were several scenes throughout the book that were not realistic and others that were incredibly boring, such as the entire first chapter which focused on Hammond's trip to the SGC. Do we really need to know Hammond's history? There were also some blatant mistakes such as Carter being referred to as a Captain and a Major in the same chapter. I hope that they find a new author to continue this book series because McConnell is not doing the show justice 
 The plot is new..yet..it didnt offer what his other books have.. Kept dragging on with the same reasoning..over and over and over again 
 I am [...] the unit because it will not run a slideshow from a media card. 16 Mb of internal memory for a slideshow is just not enough! Read on!  If you call they will tell you that the slideshow from cards is not possible because on Page 13 refers to excluding pictures from the slideshow on only on internal memory. This is not a definitive statement that slideshow is not possible from a card only that excluding individual pictures from a card is not possible. (because the unit is not capable of writing to a media card.)   Looking further on p13 it states: "Choosing slideshow frequency Note: This function applies to photos stored on all media." Page 27 in FAQ states: "2) Q: Can I switch between different slideshows photos by using different memory cards? A: Yes. When you connect your memory card to PhotoFrame(tm), it will slideshow photos stored on that specific card." Finally, the Quick start guide FAQ states: "Q Can I switch between different slideshow photos by using different memory cards? A Yes, Digital Photo frame will slideshow photos stored in the card or camera currently connected."   Clearly the three references I provide indicate that the DPF can operate slideshows from a media card. IN REALITY SLIDESHOWS FROM MEDIA CARDS DOES NOT WORK. Philips how about a firmware upgrade?  I bought this thing to allow my mother who is not computer savvy and lives far away to look at family pictures. I was planning on sending preloaded cards to her. All she would have to do is insert the card and turn it on. (Mom is 75 and this is as technical as she gets..). Do not buy this DPF for older, none computer savvy people. Since media card can not be used, you have to use the internal memory for slideshows. The internal 16Mb memory can hold about 70 pictures - that's it. It is also unclear the maximum size a file can be. I believe the internal memory converts the file to a DPF friendly format and renames the file when copying from a media card. (How is Mom going to tell me which picture to print if the name changed?) Why have media card slots if they are useless? Internal memory is way too small! DO NOT BUY and save yourself the hassle. 
 There is no doubt the artist's voice is beautiful.  However, the interpretation of certain songs by a man and child are way off.  For example, "Tengo Una Muneca" is NOT a lullaby, but an upbeat  children's song and to have a child drone it out debases such a Mexican  classic. One of many aweful and inacurate musical interpretations on this  misguided CD. For the best and most classic Spanish children's songs turn  to the tender and playful "Cri-Cri.&quot 
 ...I did not like it all!...the book is so predictable! By the 3rd to last chapter, I already knew what was going to happen. I do not reccommend this book unless you like books about history 
 This plan is a hazard to your health -- no exaggeration.  It's a '70s-style two-week crash diet that eliminates ALL carbohydrate-based foods, including whole grains.  You'll be eating nothing but meat, protein powder and vegetables for two entire weeks to start out.    Kirsch encourages you to drink two protein shakes a day so won't have to prepare food, giving you more time to do the 90 minutes' worth of working out (45 minutes of strength/toning, 45 minutes of cardiovascular).  Nice sentiment, but that is too much for anyone but a performance athlete, and it's nothing but a way to set you up for failure if you aren't already working out.  Physically fit people can quite easily achieve and maintain health with 30 - 60 minutes a day, no more than six days a week (though I don't deny that an hour is probably better for beginners).  NOBODY should ever work out 90 minutes a day every day, even for two weeks.  Where he's really peddling hazardous medical advice comes in the recipes.  Yes, it's another one of those stupid diets that won't let you have carrots or fruit (in fact, he brags about how he was able to 86 the carrots in one recipe).  How many times to doctors and exercise physiologists have to say this?  You lose pounds on these protein diets because they deplete your glycogen stores -- and when you use up glycogen, you shed water.  ATTENTION PEOPLE: THERE IS A REASON THAT PEOPLE DOING THESE STUPID LOW-CARBOHYDRATE DIETS LITERALLY GAIN FIVE POUNDS IN A SINGLE DAY AFTER EATING STARCH.  YOUR BODY STARTS TO HOLD ON TO WATER AGAIN, AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO DO.  These diets make people dehydrated, lethargic and light headed.  You cannot survive long-term on them.  He also drops ridiculous pseudo-science here and there, like his vague reference to "research" that shows artificial sweeteners are treated like sugar by the body.  Give me your citations, chump.  That is an outright lie.  There's never been any such claim in a replicated, peer-reviewed study.  AWFUL advice.  I don't care what celebrity client names he drops.  You will fail with this ludicrous, by-the-numbers "low carb" plan, because no person on Earth will follow it for long.  Every friend I know who still "believes" in this outdated, firmly debunked garbage actually eats sugar and starch on the sly.  I've witnessed it with my own two eyes.  They are very natural foodstuffs -- things that humans are clearly evolutionarily meant to consume.  I am extremely sorry none of the other reviewers mentioned this before I bought the book.  The older I get, the more I believe people peddling this snake oil should be prosecuted for dispensing fraudulent medical advice 
 My book club strikes again with this inane, predictable and hard to complete selection.  I think Kim Edwards found the novel difficult to finish writing, because the ending was even more bland and poorly developed than the rest of the book.  The premise of the novel is interesting enough, which is why I found it mildly engaging.  However, I found myself hating all the characters in the book (save Phoebe).  The metaphors the author uses are for the most part cheap, and are further deflated by their constant repetition.  How many starfish metaphors can she make in the course of just a few paragraphs?  Then there was the overuse of several phrases..."silverfish" is just one that comes to mind.  Still, this was Kim Edward's freshman novel, so I can excuse some of the overly-elaborated and amateur metaphors; hence the two star rating.  I had a difficult time trudging through this book to reach the end.  The middle section could have been half as long and still sufficed.  The characters were all, without exception, poorly developed and painfully uninteresting.  This doesn't make the invisible plot any more tolerable.  I would say that if you really wanted to feel like you wasted your time reading something, then choose this book.  There is certainly nothing to be gained by reading it 
 Every Christmas since I was 11 I have gotten this book as a gift. Last year was no different but I am really pissed off that the company was too lazy to wait for the November 2 Election Results. This was the same terrible decision they made for the 2003 issue. They must suppose us peons can get the information online now. But the great thing about the Almanac is that you could read about the elections w/o being near a computer.  Another change they made in the 2004 and '05 editions was to list the 1990 and recent Census Estimate populations for cities over 5,000 but not the official 2000 pop's. It makes it seem as though almost every town in America is booming when that is not the case. They should put 2000 official population and the most recent estimates instead.  My favorite sections are: Politics and elections, population, the countries of the world, birth rates, employment, and the top 10 stories of the year. Having a crossword puzzles instead of factual information is a really bad decision and cheapens the book as a whole. I'll still ask for this book as a Christmas present, I just hope the 2006 issue returns to The Almanac's previous high standards. 
 Our family bought this tank and we went through plenty of goldfish with it. We stopped buying when our 10 year old was using the scope to look at the fish. She was pulling it up and down and turning it and when she was finished, she put it down and saw that she had put it down on the actual fish. The fish was bleeding and died. The kids were not very happy. I guess this is an okay tank but not great. You might want to put only beta's in it. I would suggest getting something with a filter and heater if you want any other kind of fish 
 I think the mobile is very cute, but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly. I tried attaching it in several differnt places. I am going to return it. 
 Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of "heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads," is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see. 
 This band is a rip off band.....plain and simple....not something NEW....they are ripping off "The Zombies".  I cant believe how easily people are duped...next we'll have some new band playing "led Zeppelin" sounding music and calling IT new....good God in Heaven!!! This is astounding!!! Truly....nothing new here folks and if you want to say they are GREAT go for it but its like a bad hack of "The Zombies".... 
 This album really dissapointed me. After the first half hour the music  warms out it's welcome. As a big fan of both ambient and jungle, I hate to  say it, but after listening my reactions were either annoyed or bored.  While this epic tries to be the "2001" of electronica, it ends  more like "Xanadu" 
 This has to be the most boring book I have ever read. Well, I haven't quite finished it yet as it's taking forever to push my way through it. And I'm sure that more boring books exist, I just haven't read them.    I wanted to learn about KKR and LBOs - particularly as a division of KKR recently bought one of the vendors supplying my own employer. I was hoping for the big picture of what took place as well as some entertaining anecdotes. But this book consists largely of page after page of uninteresting minutiae of conversations between the various parties involved. There really is no need for such detail and a little bit of editing could have halved the size of the book without losing any essential information. And a bit of theoretical discussion would have been far more valuable than some of the biographical material. It felt a bit like watching someone else's home video. It probably means a lot to the people involved, especially as they'll get the in jokes and quirks of the participants, but it's painfully boring for strangers forced to watch it out of politeness.  I'm sure that much of the conversation is fiction anyway. People don't reliably remember this level of detail of converstaions over a period of years. What are remembered are broad brushstrokes - and this is what the author should have written.  There are occasional moments of entertainment - like Ted Forstmann obsessing about the evils of junk bonds. But most of the characters seem quite flat and uninteresting.   The fact is: I wanted some of this information in this book. As it provided some of this, albeit with a lot of suffering on my part, I'll give it two stars.  Update: Well I did finish this book eventually. My final opinion is much the same 
 This is a valiant effort but the author concentrates way too much on contemporary music and "trendy" scene bands; it's as though she never listened to anything that came out before 1980.  A far better bet is "Music Lust" by Nic Harcourt, which is basically the same concept but written by a professional music journalist and KCRW radio DJ, which gives much better lists of songs and artists 
 The actors are wonderful, but the story it is very sad!!! I wish an old Italian RICH lady would have gone to England and married a poor man!! Than, her Italian family at the end would have killed the baby.......!!! But, this is not important for the writer, as long as there is a happy ending for the english world!!!!  I hate it !!!  hypocrit!!! 
 It's hard to believe I watched the same movie as everyone else here. This movie fails on every level. It isn't a good action movie, or a good silly movie, or a good comedy, or a good satire ... or much of anything but an endless parade of lame gags, terrible dialogue, weak characters, vapid plot, and so on. There isn't anything redeeming about God of Cookery. Don't be fooled into thinking you'll like it because you like Shaolin Soccer, Iron Chef, Rumble in the Bronx, Ong Bak, or almost any other far-superior show or movie to which it might be compared. God of Cookery is just painful, feeble, and empty 
 Unlike the rest of the Rich Dad books that I've read -- which were for the most part fantastic -- this book was terrible.  Michael Lechter may indeed be a very bright guy and a star in his field, but he is an absolutely horrendous writer.  The intro by Robert Kiyosaki was the only really enjoyable part to the book.  Lechter immediately jumped into complex explanations of the various types of IP protection available without really clarifying anything for the lay person like me.  And no real life examples of anything -- just references to a couple hypothetical "horror stories" that he relays at the beginning of the book.  The only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is because at the very least I was able to get some basic definitions of IP terms down.  But I guess I could've gotten that from a dictionary too 
 If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time--don't.  I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked.  There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward.  It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either.  Do your self a favor and skip it 
 I don't usually do fiction, but have picked up a few excellent reads in that category. This isn't one of the best. For those who prefer nonfiction, and who are seeking a concept of god they can live with in good concscience, check out God Without Relgion by Sankara Saranam. 
 Being new to VB I expected this book to help me through the rough spots.  I am a embedded programmer who uses mostly assembly language, but wrote a fair amount of C programs on the PC using the old Borland 4.  I find that seeing some examples is my best way to learn.  You would have thought with 25 years of experience I could figure out how to code in VB.    Well, this book looks like some C++ I have seen, not like any basic I am familiar with.  Most examples look like cryptic C++.  Perhaps this is the way VB6.net is, and, if so, I should have bought visual C++ because I know C, just not C++.  I suppose the book is fine for experienced VB programmers, but I cannot recommend it as a highly experienced programmer 'trying' VB for the first time 
 So this is what the onetime flagship of the east coast has to offer us. a bunch of remix's with washed up rappers(Craig Mack comes to mind). Hip hop turned pop. BIG gotta be spinnin in his f***in' grave. Knowing he use to roll with this sellout b**ch puffy. Jackin' beats, spittin other ni**as verses, rappin about his wealth. Everything about this ni**a is wrong. He's not even talented, just ridin a dead rapper's street cred. F*** badboy for life 
 I must admit that I finished only 2/3 of this book, I just could not bear anymore, even as entertainment.  It was that bad.  But, from what I read, I advise that the plot is pointless and unrealistically laid down.  The characters, especially the main character and her love interest, are very poorly developed.  What is developed of the main character is unlikeable.  The book has the tone of someone who is talking (i.e. writing), not because she has something to say (she doesn't), but because she likes the sound of her own voice.  Wolitzer does know how to string words together well, but there is nothing upon which to hang those words, which is insulting to the reader. I knew before I read the book jacket that Wolitzer much teach creative writing.  It is obvious from the content of the book that she considers herself a literary giant and thinks that impressive. She should stick with that, her "novel" is beyond disappointing.  I'm sorry but the comparison to Wolitzer to Anne Tyler is laughable. 
 ...at least of the ones I've had, and I've had a lot of them. This is like a bad sitcom where they take chunks of older epsiodes and try to make a new one because they're too cheap and out of ideas to make something new. Most of the DVD is made up of classic, but heavily duplicated shorts having to do with numbers. There was not one that I did not already know was on another DVD. In between, they had Elmo and Telly doing some kind of video-game like adventure that made no sense. Much of the acting and movement was so bad that I think that they must have just done it with one take and accepted it. Come to think of it, the plot is so weak that they may have made that up as they went along. As if to add insult to injury, the DVD is very badly made so that you can only get to the video by fast-forwarding (not skipping!) through the annoying commercials in the front, especially that god-awful elmocize commercial that gives us parents nightmares. If you skip it, then you see the FBI warning (oh pleeze) and the Sony Wonder logo, and then you're back to the main menu to start all over again. It's like trying (and failing) to get a piece of childrens software to run on the computer - a crap shoot, and you only wind up frustrated and with a very angry toddler. Save yourself the pain and annoyance, this DVD isn't worth the plastic it's made out of 
 I'd be okay with a story that had 1 or 2 last-second escapes, but this book has at least 10, if not more!  I think the author spent too much time watching action films and incorporated every single escape trick into one book.  Even a Bond film would not go this far out on a limb.  They only other Reilly book I've read is The Contest, which I suppose was just as far fetched, but I give that one more latitude since it was science fiction and this one is not.  Another complaint is that a 16th century manuscript is woven into the story - which is not a bad idea - but there was no effort at all to change the language to the appropriate era.  The book does have a lot of action though... so if you like wild adventure and can completely suspend reality, you'd probably enjoy.  Appropriateness:  I would like to have recommended this as a fun action book for teens, but be aware that it contains a lot of language and a lot of violence.  There are many gruesome deaths of all varieties.  There is no sexual content or discussion of it 
 The best way to destroy sales is for the "author" to blast portions of the book.  In the follow-up to the commercially successful Catch This!, Terrell Owens has said there are erroneous passages in T.O. Because of that comment, it brings into question the validity of the entire book.  Love him or hate him, Owens is a pop culture phenomenon and that may be why Simon & Schuster rushed to print a second autobiography. I can only guess that Owens was not happy with the project and decided to tank sales by ripping the finished product.  Within the proper context I am sure Owens has a ton of interesting things to say. The line of children's books slated for release may be the venue for Owens to make a positive and lasting impression with fans.  
 My two year old really doesn't like this book.  I got it since all the other books we have by the same author are really cute.  This one is just a grumpy book.  I'm sure there is a lesson, yes, but I will find another way to teach my son that bullying isn't right 
 My drive FAIL after one year and a half...!!! This company really suck BIG TIME....I lost all of my data ...!!! ALL OFF IT...!!! THIS IS THE THIRD ONE THAT FAIL OUT OF FOUR OF THEM I PURCHASED LAST YEAR!!!  Total JUNK...!!! NEVER buy a LACIE AGAIN FOR SURE....MAXTOR EXTERNAL IS THE BEST!! 
 It goes way too fast////i do like the abs workout section but the aerobic section isnt good. I will never buy firm tapes agai 
 This was my first Patterson book, and while I may still try some of his other works, this one was not interesting or gripping in my opinion.  The character development was weak.  The novel is full of twists in the plot, and has a few good moments, but the people seem too simple to really grab my attention.  If you have not read this author before, I would try a different book first.  I have heard that some of his other books are quite different from the books in this series. 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 As big a Peter Cetera fan as I am, this is one album I easily live without.  Tracks 1,2,3, and 5 are passable but don't compare favorably to World Falling Down, One More Story, or Solitude/Solitaire.  The rest of the album all blends together, lacks any memorable hooks, and is at times unlistenable.  It may not be entirely Peter's fault; the production here is consistently uninspired.  There are so many wonderful albums in the world.  Don't succumb to completism!  You don't need this 
 I may not be a teenager anymore, but I too have suicidal tendencies occasionally. After reading this book, it doesn't seem to be a big deal to actually go through with it. In fact, it sounds pretty neat! Thankfully, as an adult, I still have some good sense left to decide against it everytime that thought crosses my mind. This book would have a tragic result in the hands of a suicidal teenager. Of that, I'm certain. However, unlike most other reviewers, I do not believe Anne Puryear had ulterior motives other than to help others in similar cirmcumstances. I do not believe she is the epitome of evil like some have portrayed her. One reviewer even went so far as to suggest Puryear intentionally drove her son to suicide so that she could write about it and make tons of profit. Those types of allegations are absurd and heartless when the simple fact remains she only meant to help. Nothing more, nothing less. Unfortunately,she was too grief stricken to realize how her book might do more damage than good. That's where her fault lies. All other accusations are ridiculous and border on the bizarre 
 Fiction doesn't get any more shallow than this, and don't let anyone kid you that it's a satiric comedy of manners. Gossipy name dropping and bed hopping may entertain Grazer's crowd but anyone with a brain is going to get turned off quickly. The book is a complete waste of time and money. I stopped reading after the first 10 pages. Yuck 
 Just like the old Chariots of Gods, his books are very interesting and and entertaining.  But please dont think that you are reading a scientific work.  Real historical works are not as sexy and entertaining as these books just as real archeologists are not Indiana Joneses.  
 I have been struggling with a true Othello syndrome .. where my mate accuses me of having a non-existent affair.  This book devotes one paragraph to that specific problem, and the advice is summarized as "get professional help".  Thanks.  This book overadvertises & underdelivers, and is probably useful for mild cases of jealousy.  If you are the victim of serious delusional jealousy then get yourself a copy of The Green Eyed Marriage, which is based on real psychiatric research and helped me cope tremendously.  If your mate drinks or abuses substance, get yourself to Al-Anon 
 what a ripoff. the "miniature version" is stashed in the details, not placed in the title. the reviews are for the full version. and now i feel like "amazon shopping for dummies". i have absolutely no use for a 2"x2" book on anything 
 and now I'm just as ignorant as the fools who wrote it. I actually have nothing to say that hasn't already been covered by other reviewers. I simply wanted to bring the rating down. Oh my god, what a horrible, horribly offensive book. If you're desperate for validation then this book is for you. If you need to prove to other people just how godless they are then you will love this book's twisted logic and general stupidity and ignorance. Reading this book is like reading an angry and overzealous fundamentalist's blog. Except it's a book. That you pay for. Pay MONEY for. It's not even that the book is biased. It seems to be almost intentionally offensive even to people like me, whose religion is not listed.   I have a list of grievances miles long. I'd like to go through chapter by chapter and explain what's wrong with this book, however I have long since returned this filth.  I will, however, make a list of everything wrong with this book that I can remember.   1. How can reincarnation be true if there are more people in the world now than there were before?  I wish the author had attempted to research the religions on something other than wikipedia. People are not always reincarnated as people, they can be reincarnated as animals, bugs etc.  2. Haile Selasie thought the Rastafarians were "ridiculous" for believing he was god! Haile Selasie never publicly dismissed nor supported the Rasta movement.   3. Should I mention the hypocrisy? On the first page of the section on Islam in bold letters there is SEPTEMBER 11TH 2001. While the book tries weakly to divorce the religion from the actions of a group of terrorists one can't help but associate Islam with the big bold letters on the page. Yet, in the Christianity section they yadda yadda'd the crusades and every other stain on the Christian religion. People invoking the name of Jesus have caused considerably more bloodshed than a group of terrorists who could hardly be called followers of Islam.   4. Vodun uses "saints" and they say they believe in God, but they use magic and zombies to hurt people. My heart exploded. Any serious research of Vodun will dispells the myth of African witch sicing zombies on people. No one can deny that there are practicioners of the religion who use it for bad (much in the same way the Pope condoned slavery or how Puritans burned witches at the stake) but it's a small, small number of people and frankly, I don't think they have enough power to raise people from the dead and such. Most practicioners of Vodun consider themselves to be good Catholics.  5. I'm sorry, but Modernism, Post-Modernism, Marxism, and Magic the Gathering are not religions. Wow.  6. Someone's review said it showed what was "logically false" about other religions. What? Two words, "Virgin Birth." Another few words, "rose from the dead," "lived in a whale," "walked on water." These things are all logically false, that doesn't stop people from believing them and it shouldn't. Faith is not logic. That's why you can't apply human logic to something human's can barely perceive. Which brings us to:  7. Did they really just reject evolution and then use the law of thermodynamics to disprove it? The irony is too much I can't even bear it. Someone once used a variation on the rolex in the woods theory to prove God existed. It was strange because 1. I already believed that God existed and 2. God is not human. Don't apply silly human logic to a being we can barely fathom.   8. This has no business being in the "world religions" section of any bookstore. You can't teach other religions from a Christian perspective because they're just that, other religions. This is a Christian book and it should be in that section.  9. The trick.  I can't believe no one stopped them from doing this. It implies just that, that every person who isn't a Christian has somehow been bamboozled into believing a worthless faith. Which means non-Christians are simply put: dumb. This the most vicious and risky part of the book. It cultivates a lack of respect for people who think differently. Lack of respect can quickly become a lack of compassion which almost always turns into hate.   Even though I really, truly hate this book, I can appreciate what the author is trying to do. Educating teenagers about other religions is a really good idea. Allowing them to make informed decisions based on accurate information is an even better idea. This book basically bullies susceptible people into agreeing with them by berating every other religion or philosphy out there. I don't want to speak for him like the book does, but Jesus did not preach disrespect or ignorance.   To all the Christians out there: You don't need this book to validate your faith. Be secure enough to read something that isn't loud and scary propaganda. Other reviewer's have recommended books that must be better than this.   I did read in "Kevin's" review that book can certainly quell people's doubts. Oh my god. Did you really need someone to bad-mouth every religion before you could finally believe? I'm so sorry. 
     What can you say about a book that introdouces three characters in one chapter? Or has a character thats entire vocabulary seems to consist of "Hotcha, Gotcha" and says that nearly 10 times a chapter. I would honestly not care if all the people upped and died. This book has no surprises but one, a "plot twist" that was obvious 6 chapters away. Did I mention I hate the annoying, underdeveloped, characters. Oh yes. I usually like Bruce Coville, but with this book, he has bought himself to a level of unreadability that is only outclassed by the sequel 
  I was shocked that Lois Shawver who paints herself as representing the "TRUE POSTMODERN" would have written a book with such obvious underpinnings of a MODERNIST theory of sexuality, Kinsey (1948,1953).    As most readers know, Kinsey as Shawver has done in this book counterpoised heterosexuality and homosexuality on a single bipolar continum, which ranges from exclusive homosexuality to exclusive heterosexuality, creating a kind of "zero sum game," in which the more one is hetereosexual, the less one is homosexual, and vice versa.  At the outset, the lack of clarification of the terms "hetersexual", "bisexual", and "homsexual" are much more complicated than thier casual usage by Shawver.  Perhaps this book and the obvious modernist underpinnings shed light on the assault led by Lois Schawver on gay lesbian and bisexual participants in the Marriage Family Therapy online community. This book leads to the forcing out and osterization of homosexuals within thier communities with the alternatives left after shedding the current don't ask don't tell policy in effect.      
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 Some don't care for this movie as it wasn't completely true to Jerome Kerns life, but I love it for the great musical numbers many of which are big production numbers. HOWEVER, I don't know what the studio was thinking when they let this into the public domain. This copy looks as though someone filmed it from the only decent copy which I have on laser disc. I wish the studio could put out a quality copy. 
 I'll give it this. The writing style in and of itself is quite good. The material however, is, if you'll excuse the pun, another story altogether. Lili grows up in a repressive/opressive environment, struggles through her life and meets a white man who is able to set her free from her horrible life. I wonder though if   we're expected to believe that Roy actually considers Lili to be his equal? I imagine their future would entail her bearing him more children and raising them by herself while he works rediculous hours as a journalist... is this supposed to be a semi autobiographical novel? Is she supposed to make him dinner every night? It seems to me that while she might have been "saved" by Roy, she still isn't master of her own life. Perhaps Lili has forced herself to believe that she does love this man, simply because he is her way out? In the end it might be a better life, but it's still not much of one, especially if her love is manufactured out of need and not true feelings. 1 out of 5. I would have given it a 1.5 but it wasn't an option, so I rounded down 
 If it wasn't for the fact that I listened to the audio book version during my daily commute to work, I probably would have abandoned this book halfway through.   The end is confusing, and I'm left wanting more, not in a good way 
 I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.   For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.   Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.   The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.  However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.   In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now! 
 This game is totally cheesy.  I was so disappointed!  It basically runs like a computer screen that shows a text question followed by the answer.  There is no scoring.  The words are not spoken.  The music is annoying.  It is a text based trivia challenge with no team play and no scoring.  Terrible as a game.  Should only be purchased if you are interested in brushing up on your 80's & 90's trivia and being bored to death in the process 
 When I was buying this, I did not know much about Muddy's or Wolf's discography, and I didn't bother reading any reviews.  In fact, I first thought it might be Muddy's own original CD called "Muddy and the Wolf" for some strange reason.  It isn't.  Half of this CD is Muddy Waters, and the other half is Howlin' Wolf.  This is not a collaboration either.  This is SOME of the material taken from Muddy's highly acclaimed Fathers and Sons CD and SOME of the material taken from Wolf's London Sessions and basically glued together into one incomplete disc.  If you think you want a *sample* of either man's style, this is probably a bad place to start because it only represents Muddy late in his career doing electrical blues and Wolf in a once-in-a-lifetime collaboration with the British rockers in London.  Not a typical sample of each man's career at all.  I do own Wolf's London Sessions and find them interesting material, but they are not by any means a true representation of the bluesman that Wolf was.  As for Muddy, you'd do much better just getting his Fathers and Sons CD.  Save your money here 
 Horrible family you care nothing for, and nobody you'd want in your own, and that's saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional.  Even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her.  Hell, I really want to slap everyone on the cast, crew, and the writers.  I bought this for 5 bucks, and it wasn't worth 5 cents.  These people are unsympathetic, unbelievable, and totally made up.  The women wear too much eye-liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs.  I bought the movie because of Johnathan Schaech (based--okay--on his pretty face and his presence in That Thing You Do), but he's not even in it that much.  He's better looking than all the girls in it too--including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when Alyssa dumps her.  I fast forwarded through this after the first half, pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made Dumb and Dumber look like  Hemingway.    In summation, if you like this movie, you have been dumbed down by the evil Hollywood machine, and I suggest you check out good foreign films like A Good Marriage and beautiful scandals like Valmont immediately.  There is no excuse for liking unmoving, plastic dreck of this nature.   
 If Kennedy or Vanderbilt is your last name and I mean The Kennedys and The Vanderbilts, if Bill Gates is your wedding sponser or if you are a member of the Royal Family then this book is for you. If you live in the real world you may not want to bother reading a book that would embarrass even Martha Stewart. Even if your wedding budget isn't that of a small nation you can uncover some ideas to use on a realistic day of bliss. But I would leave out the "Honeymoon bed out in the open" next to a swamp unless you are marrying Jeff Corwin or the Crocodile Hunter. Look at page 116 and see if you would like to spend your wedding night there but McBride-Mellinger says "far from sight of the area's inhabitants". It's also far from sight of a bathroom,room service and Walgreen's to get some mosquito spray and close to sight for anything with four or six legs or even eight hairy ones that hopefully would be four groomsmen rather than a spider. As in all the weddings in the book, the cakes are works of art, the prettiest I've ever seen (pgs 106&107, 214&215 "a masterpiece" and the chapter on Confections) and the flowers are magnificent. If you read this book make sure to have a dictionary for all the $2.00 words as it must have been written with a word processor in one hand an a Thesaurus in the other. Also, a really good cook book will come in handy to try and figure out what everyone was eating. McBride-Mellinger is even so helpful as to tell you how to dress the "help" as if in this day and time the guests even know what to wear, where the "help" should go to the bathroom, and to prepare food incase they work more then four hours. But do show respect because Maria McBride-Mellinger has a very high opinion of herself and a much over inflated ego. "The Perfect Wedding Reception" is that: perfectly ostentatious,pretentious,over the top and prefectly not for middle class America. The book is a "perfect" waste of a good tree. For over 30 years I have been a floral artist and wedding planner with the experience of over 500 weddings in all parts of the US and Europe 
 I see where this would be appealing to sum. I just never "got it".  Oh well. 
 Yes! Can you imagine, a picture book of "cottages" and it is riddled with filler pictures. There are pictures of houses that are much to large for "cottage" definition, there are pictures of structures that have none to very little moldings or marks of even being close to "cottage" and I have to say that although I am not familiar with this photographer- he must have gone through his stack of mediocre leftovers and stuck them into this collection. There is even a picture of a row of houses that look like projects. Cottages by the Sea is a much better book. I will do more research on Douglas Keister but from what I have seen thus far, I will not be promoting him to any of my cottage fanatic friends. This guy does not know the first thing about cottages and I even believe I could have done a much better job myself with a collection of TRUE cottages and my digital camera. Maybe I will. I give this a 2.5 
 The book is about how you should prepare to public speech. It talks about how to setup a stage, how to work with a michrophone, how to walk in a stage and the known advices as 'know your audience' and 'rehearse'.  I think this might be good reading if you lack any clue about the process but for people that need to improve their presentation skills it's not worth. Also there's almost nothing on tips for preparing slides (the most common media, I think).  The author keeps giving infinite acronyms where she wants to work on topics (almost all topic groups gets its own) and it's really annoying 
 There are a couple of good songs on here. I love the song Sunday Morning. But then they went and put crappy songs like "Hey Baby" and "Hella Good" on it, and it just went to hell. Plus all of their most overrated songs, which I just am not a big fan of. No Doubt was awesome up until Return Of Saturn, and Gwen's solo career just sucks horribly. 
 I guess I expected more out of this movie but I confess I was mildly disappointed in it. At first, the movie seems to be having a hard time making up its mind whether to be a comedy or a drama and the resulting mish mash is a bit unsettling. Still, it was a great cast; Dean Martin was particularly adept at westerns, much more so than Frank Sinatra, who pretty much plays Frank Sinatra in this one. It is fun to see the two of them compete for the ladies, in this case, Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress. The bad guys are well represented by Victor Buono and Charles Bronson. A fun movie but not particularly memorable.  
 It's a cute little set - and I mean little.  Wayyyyy over-priced.  (...) Just didn't live up to expectations 
 I enjoyed the selections made in the past by Windling and Datlow, they have truly opened my eyes to many writers that I would never have considered reading and even one story that I still gives me nightmares! These compilations were always great for assisting me in locating books written by up and coming authors and their recommendations are generally dead on....however, since the series has added two new editors the quality of stories has dropped dramatically. Gone are the truly scary and wonderous stories of previous additions. I keep buying and hoping that the series improves and I can once again rely on it as a solid anthology 
 The chocolate war  The chocolate war was one of the best books I have ever read...NOT! The chocolate war portrayed a very inappropriate scene. The boy jerry was supposed to sell chocolates but refused, but the book sidetracks and talks about naughty things and also swears a lot. I would not recommend this book because it seemed inappropriate. I don't think that this book should be available to children at a middle school level. This story might be better if the bad words and other bad things war taken out. I think that the story line seems great when jerry denies selling the chocolates because of Archie. Archie is a suspicious character that knows every one. I wish this book was more school appropriate, but it isn't and was a horrid book. Therefore, this book would be great if the author published a book with the Sam story but more school appropriate situations and words 
 "Ender's Game" and "Speaker for the Dead" are modern classics of SF, well-written novels with an emphasis on characters that is often lacking in the genre.  Even a spectactular novel would be hard-pressed to follow these two.  But "Xenocide" is not a spectacular novel at all.  Instead, "Xenocide" is talky and implausible.  The Ender books are not all about action.  But not much happens at all in "Xenocide."  Contrast "Speaker for the Dead," which is not by any means an action/adventure novel, but which is chock full of character-driven actions.  I can sum up the problems with "Xenocide" in one phrase, a howler uttered by the superintelligent Jane entity after being made aware of a huge plot hole (one she obviously should have noticed) - "Now that you mention it..."    Fans of the series should simply stop at "Speaker for the Dead. 
 I bought this product after having taken Diet Fuel w/ ephedra several years ago. I needed energy this time and to lose a few extra baby pounds.  Within minutes of taking my FIRST and ONLY pill I had a horrible reaction.  I broke out in WELTS within 10 minutes all over my body. I was shaky and sick to my stomach.  I drank 5 glasses of milk to neutralize it and finally started to feel better. I thought I was going to die.  My only thought was there was no way losing weight was worth never seeing my kids again. After about 2 hours the welts disappeared but I felt horrible for the rest of the day.  Obviously there is something in it that doesn't get along with my body but after that reaction I had I have decided that no diet pill is worth the chance of what can happen to you.   
 After hearing and reading a number of astonishing things about this book, I had to give it a read.  What I found was not exactly what I expected.  While some sources have described the Dru character as a "sinister dictator", the truth is not quite so interesting.  The book itself is nowhere near as interesting.  Upon opening the book to the table of contents, one can't help but take notice of the number of chapters in this book.  There are 53 chapters in just 173 pages!  For those of you who don't have a math minor, that's a little over 3 pages per chapter.  And for some reason, many of the chapters are explicit continuations of the chapter before.  What was the point of this?  Why not keep the two chapters a single chapter?   Needless to say, the writing here is atrocious.  The plot is paper-thin, the characters don't develop one iota, and a romance sub-plot rears its ugly head on the last two pages of the book!  How was this book published?  Why was it put into print?  Therein lies the intrigue.  While it was anonymously written at the time, it is today well-known that the author of this book was Colonel Edward Mandell House (he gives a little hint in the text when two characters meet at Mandell House [yeesh!]), who was the virtual co-president of the United States with Woodrow Wilson.  Wilson admitted time and again that House was his "alter ego", even to the point that House was given accomodations in the White House.  Why is all this important?  Philip Dru leads a revolution against the United States government.  Not a bad thing in and of itself, if the reasons had been more compelling.  What happens in the aftermath, however, brings shudders to students of history.  Philip Dru becomes dictator of the United States, without too much reservation.  He tosses out the national constitution, as well as the state constitutions, and has them rewritten.  He institutes a graduated income tax (which did not exist at that time in the U.S. because it was ruled unconstitutional;  however, with the "ratification" of the 16th amendment just a year or two after the publication of this book, we got one for the first time and have lived under it ever since), forces popular election of senators, nationalizes industry, and reorganizes the entire government at his whim.  And Dru is definitely portrayed as the friendly protagonist.  If the First Lady were to write a book calling for revolution, abolition of the constitution, and a unitary dictator, would we worry?  I sure hope so.    But more worrisome is the fact that all of these thing eventually did come to pass in this country.  (Sure, the constitution wasn't abolished and rewritten.  However, the New Deal Supremee Court made rulings that effectively gave Congress carte-blanche to pass ANY law it felt like, even those that explicitly violate the constitution [see USA PATRIOT Act]).  Was House prescient?  Did he simply see the tides of popular opinion swarming over the masses?  Or was he simply one of the many manipulating the domestic policy of our republic behind the scenes?  The structure and execution of this book are amateurish at best, more likened to the writing of a 10th grader than any kind of real author.  Perhaps that is the point.  This book was clearly aimed at the unwashed masses.  Every piece of dialog in this book espouses the benefits of socialism and evil of capitalism.  But this effort is so transparent that it leaves us with nothing of any literary merit, and in its place only political ramblings of a clear Fabian socialist.  These ramblings, of course, entail bringing up relevant issues and injustices (female suffrage, corporate exploitation) and packaging them with solutions that involve only the addition and centralization of power in the federal government.  While those who educate themselves will see this work for what it is, the many people who read this book (not today, since people don't read, but back then there were probably more than a few) would end up buying into bad solutions for exaggerated problems.  There is absolutely no reason to buy this book.  The price simply doesn't justify it.  A reader will gain no enjoyment from it.  This book only redeems itself in its historical context:  it was written by a man who pushed Woodrow Wilson to sign the Federal Reserve Act, which destroyed our economy and continues to devalue our money to this day;  to lead us into World War I, despite his campaign promises not to (the Lusitania was carrying English munitions and was a valid military target); and to attempt to sacrifice the sovereignty of our nation to a world governing body in the League of Nations, which our Congress rightly rejected 
 Please don't waste your money on this agenda-driven, ill-informed book. Anyone who tries to convince you that climate change is not a serious and potentially catastrophic problem is either delusional or receiving funding from the oil industries. There are dozens of much better, more persuasive and well-researched books out there: James Gustave Speth's Red Sky at Morning is a good place to start.   Just because something is comfortable to believe,  legitimates your current lifestyle, and doesn't ask you to change your habits of consumption does not make it tru 
 Of course I want to restore my mind and body!  The title alone made me want to read the book.  However most of the "miraculous" claims are supported by case studies from the doctors' clinic without a single footnote referencing any medical study.  Those who are skeptical of traditional Western medicine MIGHT enjoy reading this.  However, I found that this book promoted a lot of unsubstantiated claims to cure whatever ails you.  Too good to be true usually is 
 "Art:  A New History:  by Paul Johnson      If nothing else,  this text has a bargain price; but there are critical shortcomings with the book.  First,  it is minimally illustrated, even if the colorful reproductions  in the book are useful.   What it lacks is reproduction of some of the most critical drawings and paintings ever made.  It has only a couple of works by Francisco Goya,  and none of his major work.  Likewise with Picasso. "Guernica" is not represented in the book, and it is one of the most powerful murals the artist ever produced.       Another reviewer correctly identified that the history seems to elevate certain secondary or minor aspects of art history,  while sublimating major or primary elements of art history.  This is a difficulty.        Although the book is large, and has some utility,  I cannot recommend it highly.  If one can afford it,  some usefulness can be obtained, but it may leave the reader with an erroneous perception of the artists 
 I find this text the height of irresponsibility.  People who legitimately do animal chiropractic have to be licensed, and must first be either DVMs or DCs with 180+ hours of additional training, and pass rigorous testing before practicing.  The very idea that laypeople are encouraged to do their own adjustments is frightening.  You can't learn this from a single book! Yikes!  You can do tremendous damage with an improper adjustment.  Will we next have books for laypeople to remove someone else's appendix?   Anybody that works on my horse must be trained as above. I beg people to not do this 
 The authors of this book need to take a course on conciseness.  As a reader, I don't want to wade through endless wordiness.  I want something dense with the insight that I need.  It's too bad because I had high expectations for this book.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 This more like a high school paper gone wrong than a serious book for adults. Typical of the nonsense circulating around lately regarding Hydrogen as an alternate fuel.  Poor science, terrible reading......  Does not factually deal with the real issues such as cost of distribution, storage and gasification.  An insult to any reader with a brain 
 Professor Gardner himself is an example of a learned person who has mastery, but lacks understanding. People, including bright persons, do apply their knowledge to reality. They are not all stuck in a time warp where the false values of their childhood control their "understanding."  Lawyers practice law. Physicists do physics. Historians write history.  Where is the gap between mastery and understanding that he opines? May it not be that there are levels of understanding? Is there really an opposition between knowing and understanding? Perhaps for Prof. Gardner, but not, I think, for the rest of us. Those who can think out of the box, so to speak, in their respective fields, the ones who can be creative are a limited number. They help and enlighten us all. Can a teacher show a child that he or she really doesn't understand what he claims to "know"? Of course. Children are malleable. Even adults can be persuaded to revise their thinking by a sufficiently persuasive speaker even if what that speaker proposes is false. We've seen it time and time again. He's riding that old hobby horse that rote learning is destroying society. It's not. It's reformers like Prof. Gardner that are driving sincere educators to despair as they drive more and more dictators of our schools to believe that the education we are giving and have been giving is inadequate through and through, based on too many false premises, and that we are all up a creek intellectually. It's the height of elitism, and hides a deeper lack of understanding 
 The author lacks of moral clarity in the issue of the Middle East.  It seems that the only democracy in that region has the fault of everything. As Mr. Sharansky explain in his last book, "The power of Democracy.....", there is at least two  ways to know when something is anti-Semitic.  1) when someone compare attitudes as diabolic.  Ej: compare Israel politics as Nazis, or the way Israelis treats Palestinian as Auschwitz (Saramago). 2)  when someone like Mr. Swisher critics  the attitudes of a Nation o people, but says nothing about the same attitude in others country or people.  It seems in these books, that Palestinian terror does not exist, that suicide terrorist take places in another planet. And yes, despite the many interviews he made, witch are interesting in many cases, this book is anti-Semitic and anti Israel, with no sustainable bases.  
 At best Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code is just a mediocre modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones. The characterization seems like it came straight out of a 70's made for TV movies. If you have read any mysteries before the plot is paper thin, the first time the true villain makes an appearance, it is basically a "well isn't that contrite" moment. But it is a fast EASY reading novel. This book is just fine for lounging on the beach or passing the time on a cross country airline flight.   Some people take the conspiracy overtones to being anti-catholic. I think this is just nonsense but if you are sensitive to this sort of thing you might be offended by this book. Althogh, there are some kooks that think this book is about reality, instead of fiction,   A much more interesting book, in a similar venue (modern day mystery with religious conspiracy overtones), is Foucault's Pendulum by Umberto Eco. Be forewarned, Eco's novel is a MUCH more challenging read but in the end is a more enjoyable novel. It is analogous to comparing cotton candy (Da Vinci Code) to a 12 course gourmet dinner (Foucault's Pendulum). Both will satisfy hunger, both are a type of food, but the popular one is something which can be consumed casually and in the end leaves you wondering if you should have made an effort to consume something that would have been more fulfilling.  
 Yeah, that's how I felt when I noticed the lack of gore and the lack of development in the characters.  Even the zombies are the same thoughout the picture.  How can a zombie go from one part of town to the next in what would take a serious muscle car at least an hour?    Regardless, it's worth owning to have the scene where they rise out of the cemetery.  The kid is downright annoying but, when I was a kid I liked him!  Suppose it's not time to have kids yet, aye?  Regardless it could have been better.  Flawed  but, if you viewed this before the first one... don't let it stop you from getting the first!  The first one rocked.  I thought the 3rd one was produced much better than this as well... but they just keep killing this series as part 4 and 5 I once again heard were terrible 
 Jeunet shot himself in the foot with this nonsense. I admire his attempt to create something cutting edge though. Personally I didn't see the whole film, I walked out before the ending. Audrey Tautou is probably one of France's least talented actresses. Yes, I know we all loved her in Jeunet's single sucessful film Amelie which is probably the only film of hers that most American's have seen but please, the girl can barely act, has no presence and no joie de vivre. Since Amelie had it's success Tautou has appeared in no less than a dozen terrible movies, the foreign shelf at Blockbuster is lined with them.  I can hear the howls of dissent from the readers of this review right now,  angrily clicking their disapproval of my review but I've studied film at NYU and have seen virtually every French film good or bad since before the Nouvelle Vague. Trust me on this one, this is a crummy film. a worthy effort at being cutting edge by Jeunet perhaps, but still a crummy film 
 Completely and utterly out of context. The author of this book takes things that appear to be out of context and lists them in this bias, prejudice and predisposed book. He appears to have prior knowledge of understanding the Bible, and has many points of topics that seem as if he is right. The reason that it is wrong is that he takes verses of the Bible and compares them to other passages that have similar subjects, but are talking about completely different situations. The whole passage, along with the text above and below that verse need to be read. The author points out many "infallible" contradictions that include numbers. During transition from the Greek and Hebrew to English there have been many different translations made. It is possible that a zero gets left off or 1 too many get put in. This is an error of man (key piece of information), not God's Word. Although man has made errors in translation, this is not God's fault, nor have any of these errors changed the doctrine of the Bible. Although the author makes it clear that he is not a believer, I think that it is written from a very bias view that has no true evidence of his theory. I would not recommend this book to others, but if you do read it, please keep this information in mind. 
 i am dumber for watching this. just a van going from town to town. with kids talking about how 'bad' their neighbourhood is!! nothing happens. just dumb people talking some sort of english that is barely understandable.... 1 star.. 
 BLACK CHRISTMAS is not as effective as HALLOWEEN. The killer is annoying, some gurgling lunatic who uses obscene language to get his point across. The direction and editing is weak. How many times do we have to see the woman wrapped in cellophane up in the attic...she's dead ..I get it...Move on! I wasnt routing for the characters or the killer for that matter...this movie just didnt deliver. HALLOWEEN and WHEN A STRANGER CALLS "borrowed" from this film and both movies were scarier 
 These books are so well written and you cannot put them down once you start. It also challenged me to really think about how I felt about the moral issues that were uncovered in each of these books even though I thought I already had a opinion.  I felt like I had moved in next door to these women. I would like to have them as neighbors 
 Mr. Dietrich, whatever his academic credentials, joins the ranks of many a China scholar that so romantasizes China that careful research and balance are rejected.  This book is so hopelessly simplistic and over-generalized  that its almost useless; documentation is almost non-existent, and his  analysis of the events of modern China are reduced to a 6th grade level  with scant detail and almost no evidence.  The "achievements" of  the communists in China are very romanticized and if one wishes to really  understand the last 50 years of China's history, this book is not the way.   Save your money 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
      I'm amazed that such an overwritten book as this found a reputable publisher, let alone received such good reviews. If it had an editor, he or she wisely decided to remain anonymous. I had been looking forward to reading this, but 400 pages in I had to stop and see if others had the same problems with it that I did. Although I rarely quit on a book, if Barry uses the phrase "influenza, only influenza" one more time, I'm outta here.     The book is repetitive, poorly organized and too long by half. The writing is choppy. Short sentences are wonderful. Moderation is wonderful. Short sentences are wonderful in moderation. As another reviewer observed, this is a good rough draft. What it sorely wants is editing, only editing. Such a fascinating subject, such a disappointing treatment. Guess I'll take the 1927 flood book out of my shopping cart.          
 Fat Joe's (A.K.A. Jose Antonio Cartagena) seventh solo album is "Me, Myself and I". Those familiar with his work may have noticed the album cover is similar to one of better releases his third album "Don Cartagena". The Bronx MC keep's this release short at twelve track's, and this album has three guest appearances which come from The Game, Lil Wayne and H-Mob. Production comes from Street Runner, LV, The Runner's DJ Khaled, Nu Jerzey Devil & Scott Scorch. The Runner's provide some of the best production on "No Drama" (Clap And Revolve) a grimy sounding cut. Lyrically Fat Joe is his usual braggy less then entertaining self for most of this album. His lyrics are as egotistical as his album titles. My problem with Fat Joe resides in the fact that he never puts any of his people on, instead following the same formula time after time. The Terror Squad is a crew full of talented MC's (even with the loss of Cuban Link and Triple Seis) and singer Tony Sunshine has a lot of potential - all of them get put on the back burner each year for a less then impressive Fat Joe album. Two of this album's closing track deserve some praise - Fat Joe's dedication to his Mom on "Bendicion Mama" and the follow up cut "Story To Tell" are decent. Buyer Beware, satisfaction not guaranteed 
 Joseph Campbell wrote "The Hero With 1000 Faces," arguably one of the most influential books of the 20th century.   Christopher Vogler wrote "The Writer's Journey," which might have been renamed "The Hero With 1000 Faces For Dummies."   Now James Frey has written "The Key," which might be renamed "The Writer's Journey For Dummies."  The only thing you will find in this book that is not in the previous books is countless directions to read Frey's "How To Write A Damn Good Novel," and other "Damn Good" books.  Do yourself a favour and read Campbell and Vogler instead 
 My understanding is that this book is an accessible summary of the ideas Catsells presents in his three volume magnum opus, the Information Age (which starts with the Network Society). If this is so, I am definitely not missing much by not having read the trilogy. This is a really bad piece of sociology, characterized by a technologically deterministic analysis. Why did I give it two stars instead of one then? Well, it does have some OK parts. Catsell's analysis of the origins of the internet is an interesting bit of the sociology of technology and what saves the book from pure technological determinism. He also presents some convincing data (gathered by other people) that use of the internet for socializing does not suck people into an on-line world, alienating them from the world of face-to-face interaction; this happens in the case of a few troubled people, but most people use the internet to enhance their already existing off-line relationships. The rest of the book basically argues that the network format of the internet is reshaping the rest of society in its image, with everything from big business to governments to social movements adopting a network form in response to the rise of this new technology. This is, frankly, ludicrous reductionism. It doesn't even stand up to a simple test of chronology--a lot of the developments that Castells argues are driven by the internet predate the explosion of ist usage in the mid-1990s. As Castells himself admits, businesses were already taking on more of a network form before the internet appeared big time on the scene, and social movement scholars have shown the same is true of transnational social movements. On top of this, Castells shows an effusive enthusiasm for all things networked, whether they be transnational corporations or the transnational social movements that oppose these same corporations. I'm really at a loss to understand how one can enthuse about both of these opposed phenomena. Castells does see some of the problems with the new network society--loss of job security and the digital divide, for instance--but he tends to downplay these. And his solution to these problems tends to come down to more of the same--more internet access, more network social organization. Talk about a narrow vision 
 I recently purchased this book on Amazon and dug in. The technology does not get in the way of the message and the author has a light humor which makes the learing process go faster. Incidentally, I had a question so I left an email for the author, and got a personal response the next day, clearing up my question. I recomend this book and other titles written by this person 
 This book covers a lot of the basics of what HLA is but contains holes.  After reading this book three times I am still left with questions as to how to implement HLA in an application.  I [...] still have unanswered questions as to how to implement the HLA.  The examples in the book are implemented in Java [...] however I would have been happier if the examples were implemented in C++ as well.  This is a good starting point, in the absence of alternatives, but could be better 
 It amazes me that in this day and age, a novel about two people who remain passionately in love throughout the book, and which uses an African-American maid and a Korean neighbor for its simpering supporting cast, which uses time travel merely as a conceit, with none of the philosophical implications of how time affects relationships: it obviously doesn't have any impact on the eternally horny Henry and Claire, can be taken seriously. This book is a Hillary Duff movie, paint-by-numbers cliches( the mourning virtuoso ruined by the shakes) racist(Black maids and Asian neighbors who say cute things and always pop over with ethnic dishes) stereotypes hiding behind a "love makes the family" veneer. This book was Barbara Cartland hiding behind Chip Kidd style cover art. No doubt Anne Hathaway will star in the film 
 I just finished doing a major remodel. I'm not a contractor so I bought a few books on the subject - this being one of them. I knew I'd be working with experienced tradespeople, but I wanted to know enough to make sure they were doing things right. The information in this book was too basic and incomplete. It might be more appropriate for someone who has a contractor building their home and wants to understand the scope of their work rather than as a guide for doing it yourself 
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 As I read this book it was easy to tell that it was not written by Mr. Cussler, the story was slow and the plot was transparent.     This book just didn't have the "zing" of the older Cussler stories.  If you are just laying around with nothing else to do it will give you something to read 
 These hair topia pills are nothing but garbage! Pure nonsense! Trust me, I know this because I used to buy them.  I first bought these pills last year in June 2005 after hair formula 37's unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage. Well, these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned, and had promised also change dry and brittle hair into long and healthy, and it did absolute NOTHING. I said to myself, like hair formula 37, that maybe I just need to give this more time, so I bought a 2-month supply and gave it 3 months in all and there was no difference at all. This product might just work for others, which it has, but it certainly didn't work for me. I must admit that I brought this on myself, as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway, and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like Giant or even hair vitamins in the damn Dollar Store! Thus, I am here to warn others not to waste their precious money. And if you are going to, please don't do it on this site-you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique.com. 
 I bought this book on the basis of the positive reviews, and boy, do I regret it. This was very little help and is written in a schizophrenic, haphazard form that is maddening. Example: right after he has you load up the first lesson, he goes off on long explanations of functions that he then says will be used in later chapters, not that one. Then he gets back to the lesson - supposedly - and goes off explaining other controls. Finally, the chapter ends and YOU'VE NEVER EVEN USED THE LESSON! He tells you to close it up and start importing your own material.  And, as stated before, there are many typos, or worse, errors like telling you to use the button on the right when he really means to say left, so it's confusing and frustrating. I used to tutor English at university level and if this had come across my desk I would have considered it a rough draft. Even from a pure logic standpoint, it's a jumble. If you're a beginner to Final Cut Express, stay away from this one 
 In a quest to find the perfect chocolate chip cookie, I followed this recipe with enthusiasm and excitement.  When I served them, the expression on everybody's face was more than I needed to know, they were absolutely the most disgusting chocolate chip cookies I had ever tasted!  Not only did the batches of cookies go in the garbage, so did the book.  
 I have seen some junk over the years, but this takes the prize...the most useful part was the 3.5mm cord and batteries. I doubt that this product cost more than $5 to make and I think its an embarrassment to Monster Cable, who I thought associated themselves with 'quality'...avoid this like the plague and go and buy the Tivoli-PAL...sure its more expensive, but you'll regret buying this Monster product, unless of course you make telephone calls with two bean tins and a piece of string, in which case you'll be pleasantly suprised 
 This book would've been a "find" if I were in my early teens, but for any adult who considers themselves a bibliophile, this book is just too lightweight.  Yes, it is about books and literature, but the coverage is extremely shallow.  I would consider this to be something like the Reader's Digest Condensed Books form of Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia.  Buy that work instead of you're looking for a good reference work on literature 
 The back cover of my copy of Stranger In A Strange Land has a quote on it from the Washington Post.  It says that it's "the best of (Robert Heinlein's) many books".  Well, if this is the best Mr. Heinlein can do, then I won't bother reading any more of his books.  Stranger In A Strange Land is one of the most disappointing "classics" I've ever read.  If you think you'd like a book where the Muslim character is nicknamed Stinky, the women are called "wenches", and one of the female characters says the following, "Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault", then this is the book for you.  I could probably overlook these missteps if only the rest of the book wasn't such hippy-dippy pseudo-intellectual garbage.  Stranger In A Strange Land may have been a classic in the Sixties.  Now it's little more than an embarrassment.       
 The music is bad and so is the dancing.  I donated this to my public library so that people can try it for free before committing any funds to it.  However it is better than no exercise at all 
 Ok, the Greg Duli thing has gone on way to long.  Is it me or does every song he writes/sings sound the same?  He has not sung a decent song since his "Helen Highwater" days...and even then it was all cover songs.  The songs in "She Loves You" remind me of a "Warhol" painting.  It's basicly a product (like Cambell's Soup) that you seen over and over in print or illustrations, then he blasts music on top of a sub-par voice and calls it a masterpiece.  I assume that's why he moved to Cali as they are so "culture starved" he can pass it off as art.    He talks of his pain and draws from his experiences of life.  I can remember Duli running home crying because the braces on his teeth came loose while sled riding.  I am sure soon we shall see a song called "Trauma in the snow on the river bank", read interviews in trade rags on how it "changed him so", and see pictures of him in the snow...with a smoke in hand of cours!   I understand that he has found a following of lost souls such as his, reaching for some truth to this life...all waiting for him to unvail some beautiful reasoning to "it all."  Unfortunately, he's just a guy from Sharon Park in Hamilton, Ohio, singing for a buck and trying to make you believe he's something other than what he really is.  Admittedly, this sometimes works, as it did for Charles Manson (not comparing the men, only their methods).  But then again, what do I know...I only buy music. 
 Wow I never would have seen the days Punk died. Lets face it Punk is a dying genre and this CD proves it. I am saddened the day that the Emo filled Vans Warped Tour Compilations beat out the Punk-O-Rama Compilations. Have you heard the Vans Warped Tour 2005 Compilation? It blows this out of the water and that's not even saying much. It saddens me that a CD with Punk in the title is a joke to Punk. Whoever said buy Depeche Mode CDs shut up you really aren't helping at all and why even bring it up? What an idiot... they are terrible 
 Bishop Spong is very interesting, instead of attacking conservatives he attacks Christ Himself.  The sad thing is for all the good points he has unless you reimagine faith (or lack of faith) like him, you can easily discount his ideas and some of the true things he says.  He is an important figure, not because of his scholarship which is laughable... he is important because he does prompt discussion and challenges the complacent. 
 The Berenstain Bears and the Messy Room is about Bother and Sister Bear who never clean their room. One day, Momma bear had enough and made the cubs change their way. After talking, they decide to do something about it.  This book teaches children about responsibility. This book is good for children from 4-11. I thought it was a pretty good book 
 the offspring..a band who draws inspiration from some of the best music around(the damned, TSOL, agent orange, adolescents, and DI), have great record label that is responsible for new records/re-issues from TSOL, The Damned, and other great legendary punk artists, and a band who used to be really great punk revival have truly disappointed me with records like this.  i fell in love with the offspring when i bought smash..after that, i proceeded to collect ignition and ixnay.and still, i loved them..but i was iffy on this..i mean i knew of songs like pretty fly and why dont you get a job and how bad they were, but songs like kids arent alright made me a buyer...i must say, i was rather impressed with this and decided that i underrated it...that was 3 years ago.  now, i think this album is just okay..i mean its good enough to be able to warrant a stay on my windows media player on my laptop, but as for keeping the disc, it isnt.  i say get this..get it cheap..rip it to your comp and then sell off. it gets old fast 
 I bought mine from JC Penney and I absolutely hate it! (I even have two of them!) Then my mother bought one from QVC and she hates it as well.  The worst part about these spice racks is that they are NOT airtight.  Thus, many of my spices have gotten moisture from the air inside and well, they've caked up which renders this product useless.  And, with the cost of spices these days, that can be pricey.  I didn't receive any more than 5 spices with my set and they were mostly ones that I would never use.  Weird stuff like Cajun seasoning - not things you use almost every day like Cinnamon.  When you try to measure out the spices as directed, you get at least double the amount so I don't recommend just holding it over your recipe and dumping it in unmeasured.  It WILL be off.  Check out the reviews for this product on cooking.com - they all concur with mine.  I definitely DO NOT recommend this product.  In fact, mine's going to the Salvation Army after 5 years of aggravation and I'm now here on Amazon looking for something else 
 These skates are very comfortable... but within ten minutes the stopper had busted. No wonder this item is no longer being sold. : 
 When I pirchased this movie I though that it would be like a beginning to end movies about the destruction and the people who worked at the World Trade Center.  I was very disappointed in the movie and would not recommed it to any one.  Marilyn A. Dillard  I wish I could send it back, but I guess you do not accept returns 
 I didn't like this book.  Truth be told, I still haven't finished it, and I bought it over six months ago.  The characters are boring; the situation (while ripe with potential) drags; and the recipes don't even sound good.  I am supremely disappointed, as I usually love what Nora Ephron does.  Bummer 
 I have read all of J. Kellerman's books and always found them fascinating..this one is just confusing.  Too many characters with way too much "conversation" with each.  One gets confused as to which one is which and why they are a concern to the case of the confession.  By the time you are half way through, you don't really care who died, you just want the story to get finished. Alex seems to be sort of the "outside looking in" and observing all this.  Thank goodness Milo is still Milo.  The Robin character is in need of some sort of mental therapy help herself and it seems peculiar that Alex would bother with her. 
 There are better live performances of Meters and related material out there. This concert seems thin in its sound texture, not very powerful, and generally and uninspired. In contrast, george Porter Jr and the Runnin' Pardners'CD, Things aint what they used to be, is much tighter and energized, and the real horns are great. So get that one if you can find i 
 I had never read Paul Auster but had heard good things about him. What an immense disappointment this book was. I almost always finish books, but I set this down halfway through and never picked it up again -- and it's only 192 pages!  I don't know if Auster wrote this because he lost a bet or if he actually thought that a first person narrative from the POV of a dog was a good idea. It doesn't really matter; the end result is not interesting, not moving, and not worth reading 
 A snappy title and a great idea did not match up to the reality once listened to. The range of songs was odd - and most were rough - both in musicianship and lyrics. We listened to the CD once and I immediately regretted buying something based on great previews and accomplished artists who contributed to the tracks. Perhaps they were all drunk on rum when they came to the studio?! Don't bother buying this. 
 I was mislead by the title of the book; I was looking for GENERAL information about the how and whys of home schooling from a non-denominational point of view. I plan on teaching my child about God and  religion, but not as part of my home schooling cirriculm. I wish I had  known about what the book was really going to discuss 
 Having just read the John Hammond bio that I purchased at the same time, I was not as impressed with this book. Even though I am familiar with many of the artists, it just didn't hold my interest that well. The author did seem to know his material, though. I just saw Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young again this summer. I wonder how they feel about each other now with so much gone on in decades before! It's a wonder more of these people didn't die of drug overdoses or std's! If you want an uplifting experience, this isn't for you 
 I thought the book was "oversold" in a way.  From reading the jacket it looked like the "answer" to the Berenger Sauniere mystery, to what on earth it was that turned this impoverished rural cure  into a wealthy identity.  Now, yes, I know we have the sacred geometry, but  it's unfinished?  Where's the follow-up on the trough near the grove of  trees?  Where's the follow-up on just what may have actually happened at  the focal point of that pentagram?  We don't see it.  While the anecdotes  are interesting, and tragi-comic in some cases, they almost appear out of  place?  In some parts I felt like I was reading "The Making of Holy  Blood, Holy Grail"" (which I loved by the way) 
 Lewis' interpretation of Satan makes absolutely no sense to anyone who knows the poem - until, that is, you realize that Lewis really believes in the devil and can't stomach the idea of a book that makes him into a hero 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 I saw this recently and was to say the least, very disturbed by the video surveilence of Kell KILLING Blackmon. It is a very sad true life story of one very disturbed individual. Troy Kell comes from Nevada, he has, now, no life..he has not had one since he was 17. He was incarcerated for a BRUTAl murder of a Man who was "stalking and harrassing" his childhood friend, "Sandy". He committeda brutal crime, shot a man 6 (SIX) times in the head at close range. This documentary shows the real inside of prison life, allbeit through the eyes of a very disturbed young individual. Kell is articulate and comes across as highly intelligent. But is he really?, he is now on Death Row. Very good documentary but also very disturbing 
 Given that Professor Dahl has written numerous books on democracy and is considered an expert in the field, "On Democracy" is surprisingly uninteresting. The book covers various aspects of democracy (history, preconditions, systems of government, elections, and its relationship to capitalism) superficially. With the exception of a few (very occasional) facts, the book provides little beyond what an educated person with an interest in democracy (e.g., college and reads the newspaper) already knows.  Part of the problem is the writing: it is meandering, thus the book's 200 pages are not enough to go into any issue in depth. Part of the problem is a lack of focus, for example, Dahl spends several pages trying to show that assembly based democracy is not practical for large populations (which should be obvious), while not a single page on how democracies in practice assess the opinions of large populations (e.g., polling, districting, etc.).  A deeper problem may simply be that Dahl is a political "scientist". Law and economics seem to have long since stripped polisci of logic and empiricism, both of which are missing here.  Why two stars (instead of one)? The book is well organized and does provide a framework for thinking about democracy; Dahl just never develops it 
 I am really impressed with the good ratings this book has gotten so far. I hate it.  The authors incapability to explain the multinational context in simple terms, his approach to pack every little, tiny detail that somehow might correlate to the overall subject into each chapter, and his inability to use formulas and graphs in an understandable way, makes me wonder if the author actually knows what he is talking about. I find this financial book the worst I had to deal with so far. As an honor student with a finance major I feel like Shapiro is trying to hard to create a book that covers all. His examples and illustrations are somewhat interesting since they provide some information on how things work in the real world, but they lack something really important that I personally find essential for demonstration purposes: clarity and comprehensiveness.  Additionally, I find his approach to verbally describe his calculations in huge paragraphs disturbing. As disturbing is his way to create his own symbols and acronyms and not using those other financial books use. When studying you therefore need so much time in figuring out, what his symbols actually mean, that you would rather read another book.  I personally doubt that Shapiro has actually understood the subject himself. He is using the trick I always use when I do not want my professors to notice my lack of understanding: verbosity. Quantity is not always good.   I would definitely simplify the book and use clearer formulas, a more mathematical approach, better graphs, more information on how these formulas could be derived, less words, fewer sub-chapters,  more interesting case studies at the end of the chapters, more problems for self-evaluation at the end of the chapters, clearer examples and illustrations....  There is so much room to improve that it might be better to rewrite the whole book using a better author. 
 This book is filled with fatuous anecdotes and virtually useless information.  It is written by an agent about agents.  There are few useful examples.  A  basketful of useless, hackneyed slogans and overworked stories, this book is a sad testimony to why readers have such a limited choice of well written creative books today 
 It seems that all previous Quickbook versions will not run on Windows Vista and I had upgraded my system. So, I bought Simple Start as the least expensive way to get a Quickbook product to run on Vista. Turns out Simple start runs fine on Vista BUT you cannot load a company file from earlier versions. Thus, Simple Start was simply useless to me. When I called Intuit customer service they said that for another $100 they'd give me a license number that would unlock that feature. By that time I was committed and had no choice. Talk about getting ripped off!! 
 THe complete fat flush program is an impossibility for most. The time it takes to shop for, prepare, and consume would be a full time job. Not to mention that you are suppose to drop everything to search out all "organic" meats, veggies and even juice! I did learn some interesting facts about how to increase bile production.  Just add some lemon to your water, cut back on your portions and enjoy life 
 It takes a few attempts to get through this book. I read it through about 3 times before I could understand what the authors point was. It is more of a documentary then anything else. Perhaps he could have ellaborated on the  myths and ledgends, as well as zodiac references to the pyramids. Other  than that, it's an interesting read 
 I am very disappointed, could not force myself to finish it! This book should not be recommended for University programs. It is biased, full of stereotyping, and has "popular", rather than scientific references (with all my respect to Daniel Goldman's Emotional Intelligence commercial success). Textbooks should be professional and free of political agendas 
 I hate Monopoly, but loved the idea of making my own game board. Sadly, MYOO had so many limitations! I gave it a higher ED rating because you can turn the game into an educational one, but it isn't intrisically educational. It doesn't print out spaces with color bars, just little green squares that you glue on the board below the pre-printed color bars. The background on everything you print is School Bathroom Green. You are stuck with Lotto squares on the board (bad for me since I believe gambling is evil). And you only have twelve Good/Bad News cards. I liked making my own money, though.  I figured out how to do most of the same stuff in Word. Here's how: I took the board from a "Your Town" clone of Monopoly and measured between the big squares. I think the individual squares are 2.5 by 3.5, but it doesn't matter, since your board may be different. In Word, I used a legal-sized paper (I think that's A5 for you Brits) and made a table that was nine columns that's how many are on my board) and two rows. Then I messed with it to get the proportions correct. You can fit three rows on one sheet of legal paper, if the return is really small, like 5 points. That gives you space to cut.  To get color bars, get your cursor in the top row. Type any letter.  Then highlight it, go up to "format" and click on borders and shading. Click on shading, click on a color, then make sure it says "cell" and not text or table. I use only 15 percent for most colors. Click on OK and you should have a color bar. Type in whatever text you want. Then click below to type in your property name. On printing, I found the last squares were outside the printing range, so I will only have eight squares next time and will print a separate sheet for "railroad" squares. The corner squares are about 2.5 inches on my board. I would recommend you make them bigger, then trim to size, so you won't have any dead space on your board. Cut and glue to a board you picked up at a thrift shop or yard sale and painted or covered. The property cards. These were actually easier than I thought. Make a table one column wide and two rows deep. Make it fill the whole page. Color as above, and type in whatever you want. When you print them out, print out 8 or 16 pages to a sheet to get cards. For chance and community chest ... well, what I came up with was using mail merge and a shipping label template. You  just print out on regular card or paper, and cut. The data file used for the merge would have your classy one-liners. I don't know about putting graphics in. Also, I can't figure out how to use merge. I did it once but can't figure it out now. Money I haven't been able to do. I have QuarkXpress and Adobe Pagemaker but don't know how to use either program. Plus, I wanted to make the money in Paint or something simple. Hope these directions help someone 
 This book struck me because it appears to address a wide issue in depth.  Unfortunately, the introduction only gives a few brief details about the authors of the book, who include mainly interested writers, as far as I can tell.  As a former history major, I have often come across examples of exhaustive research; unfortunately, this book cannot fall under that criterion.  Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln are not trained scholars and their mildly critical perspective leads to some interesting logical jumps.  Unfortunately, the authors will posit a claim with only one source to support their argument.  This sort of specious scholarship allows the writer many freedoms in terms of the conclusions he can come to, because of the lack of acknowledgment of conflicting sources which would heap contrary evidence on his weak claims.  Overall, the book is neither terribly interesting nor well-researched.  This is like if the Da Vinci Code were a restaurant and Holy Blood, Holy Grail were the menu.  It seems appetizing but there isn't any substance or sauce to entertain the taste-buds.  
 The clear/colored picture of a rooster on this handbag...which you can't tell from the picture. Kinda weird 
 I came to Kellerman after dabbling in Stephen White's Alex Gregory novels, a series about which I'd developed rather mixed feelings. In order to get some perspective I decided to go back to one of Dr. Gregory's role models, with the book that started the Alex Delaware franchise.  In the beginning, When the Bough Breaks was a revelation. Flawlessly written, with perfect pacing and a slowly building sense of menace, this book is required reading for any fan of the genre. However, problems develop about 2/3 of the way in.  *******SPOILERS FOLLOW********  Things took a turn for the worse when Detective Milo Sturgis dropped out of the action. At first I didn't notice he was gone because the pace was still holding up very well. In hindsight, this awkward handling of a major character is indicative of Kellerman's unbalanced approach. My first real problem came with the overlong episode at Jedson College, where the plot relies on dense passages of expository prose. This seemed like an immature writer's mistake, and it was odd coming after so many pages of confident buildup.  Looking back on it now, I wonder if Kellerman is one of those writers who is better at setting the stage than he is at leading the reader to a conclusion. My satisfaction rapidly evaporated as the story reached its climax. What started as a haunting meditation on loss and evil, in the manner of Stephen White's Private Practices, became overblown, with too many plot elements and a dramatic showdown that could have been lifted right from the latest Hollywood action movie.  My final opinion is that for all of his flaws--the smugness, the lapses into banality--Stephen White displays a craftsman's mastery of the mystery thriller, a mastery that strangely eludes Kellerman. Two stars 
 Philosophers were the worse thing that happened to Islam, worse than philosophy is the suffism and worse than suffism is the shiism. I consider Shiism to be worse the suffism becuase if there no darn shiism and their teachings, there wouldn't be such a thing a suffism. Shiism the root of this evil phenomana.  It is unfortunate that these kind of books are being published under the name of "islamic religion"  and a few ignorent people getting attracted to this sufi/shia nonsense 
 Losing a court case is like suffering a poker "bad beat."  Nobody really wants to hear your story, and it's considered "whining" if you don't get over it after one beer.  Amazingly, losers comprise more than 50% of all lawsuit participants.  Most go away muttering under their breath about judges who don't understand them.  Some can't get over their legal "bad beat" and write books about their loss.  So say it, so be it.  The Discovery Institute has published their whine after the Dover bad beat.  Entitled "Traipsing Into Evolution,"  it appeals to the court of public opinion.  Appeal denied.  This is a wretched book.  The Discovery Institute PR campaign for Intelligent Design bears a laughably strong resemblance to Baghdad Bob, the Iraqui "Information" minister who claimed there weree no Americans in Iraq's capital city as those same Americans pounded up the stairs into his own studio.  His mere statements of fact served as their own proof, no matter how outlandish.  Traipsing continues this M. O.  None of the factual assertions in this book are to be taken seriously.   The book overlooks a peculiar idiosyncrasy of courts.  Unlike Iraq's ministry of Information, courts rely on something called "evidence."  There are two components to that concept.  First, only evidence actually admitted in court "counts." Out of court self serving press releases are not evidence and don't count.  Second, the evidence proffered in court must meet certain minimum requirements.  Witness testimony, for example, must be both under oath and subject to cross-examination.   That means witnesses must answer questions from an attorney who is not sympathetic to the witness's own position.  The witness  cannot decline to answer and the witness must tell the truth.  In the Dover trial, the Intelligent Design side offered: (1) out of court press releases; (2) proffered witnesses who waffled, equivocated, and finally admitted the lack of factual support for ID when cross examined; and (3) some of the Intelligent Design witnesses got caught lying under oath.   The trial judge's opinion detailed ID's lack of evidence and the witness testimonial defects, including the falsehoods, throughout his 139 page decision.  Any intellectually honest post-mortem would have addressed these issues head on.  If you expect Traipsing to do so, you'll be disappointed.  Traipsing argues that ID is good science and that it is not creationism. In "Bhagdad Bob" fashion, the book offers Discovery Institute press releases as "evidence" in support The court rejected both propositions based on the evidence actually offered at trial.  As just one example, two Discovery Fellows, Michael Behe and Scott Minnich testified as experts.  Both were asked under oath if ID was science.  Both had the choice to answer truthfully or to lie and prevaricate.  To their credit, they answered truthfully.  Minnich testified that ID was not science and Behe testified it was as scientific as astrology.  Based on this evidence from ID's own proponents, the judge not surprisingly found that ID was not science.  Frankly, the authors distort both the in-court and out of court evidence in their book.   The book makes much of the fact that the judge found a lack of peer reviewed literature and ignored the "vast" ID favorable literature enclosed in the book as Appendix B.  There are two reasons why the judge did not consider this literature.  (1) it was out of court hearsay, not subject to cross examination; and (2) It is not scientific research, it is essentially propaganda. This second point is why nobody was willing to actually testify in court that such peer reviewed ID-specific scientific research existed.    If you are interested in what really happened, get it from the horse's mouth.  Read the opinion itself and the actual evidence and trial testimony.  Both are online. 
 The application of the Golden Rule to our everyday lives is something that we can all agree is good.  John Maxwell does a good job or defining the golden rule, its worldwide acceptance, and how we can apply it to our everyday.  It was more like a walk down memory lane; to a time when a teacher or mentor first explained the concept to us.  However I do have a few concerns with Mr. Maxwell's book.  First there might need to be a better job at researching Fletcher thoughts on Relativism...in his book he labels Fletcher as the father of mordern day Realativism...quoting (or rather misquoting) Fletcher's statement that love can justify anything.  I am in not postition to defend Fletcher, for I am not that familiar with his work, however he does not just use the term love.  Rather he uses the term Agape Love, coming from the ancient Greek...the highest and purest form of love...one that God would have for us, a term any minister or pastor of the Christian Faith would know very well.  Second after page 86 the book get repediative and seems to get off track.  This links to my last issue with the book and why it gets a bit off track, as it turns into an advertisement for Mr. Maxwell's corporation, the last several pages are nothing but adverstisements asking you to visit their web site for free character quiz and then taking you down a road of Buy...buy...buy our products.  Not what I expected and was somewhat disappointed.  In short taking some know concepts, putting a somewhat of a new spin on them and then publishing to add another book to the list of those authored.  Part of the disappointment is that I know this book could be better 
 This book was so boring I could barely stand it. In fact, I had to abandon ship halfway through. The main character is kind of interesting, as are the two kids, but the story itself is so slow-paced that the characters can't carry the book. I am a huge reader and I can count on one hand the times I've had to quit a book midway, but this one just couldn't hold my interest. I found myself daydreaming everytime I tried to read it. The writing was over the top...the author sounds as if she's writing to try to get an award rather than tell a story. Pretentious readers may try to act like they enjoyed this mess, but don't believe them. One of the worst books I've ever read 
 I had never read the Scarlet Pimpernel, nor seen any of the films. One day when I didn't have time to finish a chapter, I thought I'd start the Introduction. I was enjoying the mystery-style nature of the story, then, in the first three sentences of the introduction they tell you who the Scarlet Pimpernel is! I have quit reading the book because of this. I plan to start again, in hopes that their spoiler was not far off anyway, but it was a terrible let down - on par with when my sister gave away they end of "The Sixth Sense" - which I could not enjoy, knowing what the big secret was. If you get this edition - or any edition, just in case - don't read the introduction 
 I watched this movie last evening and I have to say that I have never seen weird, confusing movie since 12 Monkies.  I'm still confused.  The plot is pathetic and mindlessly confusing, it's all about lucid dreams and Tom Cruise seeing how many times he can flick his hair in a minute while the cameras on him.  The film is basically all a blur from start to finish, it's a dreadful mix of sci-fi nonsense and obvious fake romance.  Why on earth would someone want to remake a foreign film with this kind of plot anyway.  Don't buy this film on DVD or you'll be wasting your money.  I'm sorry if you've found this review uninformative, but since Vanilla Sky is really about nothing whatsoever it's very hard to go into much detail. 
 Puhlease folks! This book is filled with the most sophomoric metaphors and turgid prose that is taught at the Iowa Writers Workshop. And people think this is great literature - HAHAHA.  Don't bother 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
    Unlike Anthony Rupert, I'm not going to say it just sucked, but I was by no means his best effort. It wasnt as utterly useless as M.A.D.E, but it wasn't good. Wasn't quite as dissapointing as Beautiful Struggle, but it wasn't good. I think that is what it comes down to.    Feel It In The Air, Oh Daddy, Change, Lord Have Mercy, Flatline, Tales Of A Hustler Pt. 2, Wanted and It's On are just incredibly dry and monotonous. That alone is 8 of the fifteen tracks so roughly half of the album is blown. To add to that, One Shot Deal and Gotta Have It are sickeningly blatant attempts to be radio freindly. Tracks of honorable mention  would be I Can't Go On This Way (its straight), Don't Stop is original, Purple Rain would be classified as dry if it were not for the guest appearances as Mr Rupert said, Bread & Butter is pretty decent (with an annoying a** hook), and where me and Mr. Rupert disagree is that I think that Look At Me Now is one of the higher quality tracks on the album (The observantion about the message in the song and him being in jail was mad funny though).    Overall, I can't just slam it because I am a genuine fan of Beans, but this just isn't good. I"m sorry, if your opinion of this album is one of high favor, you have to be biased or not a true head, because we have seen what Beans can do and in comparison, this is a very lack-luster effort. Lyrics are there (sort of), but the album is like a steak thats well the hell done for all you beef eaters. Just not good. I hope its becuase he is in jail..............I really hope its because he is in jail 
 I wish there was a way to give this a rating below one star, because this movie certainly doesn't deserve any. I'm a sixteen-year-old highschool junior and i know for a fact that I could write a better script than this. PLEASE don't waste your money. As the person who reveiwed this before me said, watch this only to make fun of the bad acting.  Oh, and for the record, you can actually hear the director yelling "Cut!" at the end of one of the scenes 
 I am a Buffet fan but I hated this CD.  The Acoustic guitar stuff is distorted. The rest has jimmy at his worst.  I recommend choosing a different Buffet C 
 Is the Internet the last, best hope for the Democratic Party? The authors, who are the  founders and moderators of two popular leftist websites, would argue a most resounding yes. However, I'm not quite convinced that theirs is the best solution, even though they gave a rousing lecture on behalf of their book a few months ago before a friendly audience at a noted New York City-based progressive think tank. And much to their credit, both in their lecture and book, they  have offered at times a thoughtful, occasionally profound, analysis of what is wrong with the Democratic Party. But frankly, I think they've missed the Democratic Party's ongoing woes, which more thoughtful, conservative authors like Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter have noted in their books.  With much regret, I also think that both authors have become part of the problem, since they have ignored the significance of ongoing battles in the global War on (Islamofascist) Terrorism, acting as if these battles had no relevance to current American politics (Daily Kos founder - and co-author of this book - Markos Moulitsas Zuniga has taken a hypocritical stance by opposing Connecticut Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman's reelection due to Lieberman's unwavering support of both Israel and our participation in the War on (Islamofascist) Terrorism, since he and his co-author, Jerome Armstrong, have argued persuasively in their book that Democratic party activists must move beyond single issue politics.). Instead, for example, I have found a more thoughtful analysis of current partisan Democratic Party views on Israel's bloody, but necessary, war against Hezbollah stated eloquently in political pundit - and commentator - Dick Morris' recent column (http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/Comment/DickMorris/072606.html) co-authored with his wife Eileen McGann, than I have seen from those posting at either www.MyDD.com or www.dailykos.com. Since some of the comments on Israel's current war against both Hamas and Hezbollah  that I have seen posted at www.dailykos.com could be described as rabidly anti-Semitic, then I have to wonder whether potential buyers should purchase this book. My own answer is no, recommending instead, more profound works written by the likes of Dick Morris, Bernard Goldberg, Kevin Phillips, Peter Beinart and Joe Conason, to name but a few, who are more thoughtful scribes across the political spectrum than the authors of "Crashing the Gate: Netroots, Grassroots, and the Rise of People-Powered Politics" 
 I thought this was a fun read some years back..well-written..hence my first inclination to give it 2 stars, but taking another look..if a man ever wrote about his "repulsion" over sex with an overweight woman, the way Robin describes sex with Michael, we'd be taking to the streets in protest...there was such an unkindness to it..and this was a woman with a dear, overweight friend...I'm changing my mind..back to one star..too much shallow emphasis on looks, money, etc..it's not a race thing..it makes all women look bad. Well, maybe just these women..I'd like to think some of us are different 
 Beginners won't really benefit from this book. The author's vague description of perspective confuses rather than explains. The book resembles a sketchbook with some notes dropped into it. I would recommend The Art of Drawing and Pencil Drawing Techniques over this thing anyday 
 I bought and downloaded the eBook of this famous book for my research. It is NOT usable. Most of the text is missing. I have never seen such a bad scanning result. Unbelievable. 
 Hello People wake up How Many times can the same 3 children escape 1 bad guy?!? this Book was horrid! Boring, Boring, Boring, After the 5th book i was snoring and this tops it all its not even the last one!!!!! After 12 books its still not over, my grandchildren will be reading the100th book if he continues like this! (and between me and you, what kind of a person cant recognize a baby in a conciarge outfit)I dont plan to even bother to read the 13th book, i can see lemony saying the series will continue after the book "The end" if there was a 0 star i would give it!! 
 ........from reading Danielle Steel.  Here's the book:  three bachelors meet three women.  They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.  BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.  I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.  Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.  My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.  THAT'S sad 
 This book was very well written.  The characters were well researched, and quite believable.  I have truly enjoyed Miss Howard's books.  I stumbled upon one of her books and picked it up not really knowing what to expect.  I am now reading the fifth of many that she has written, and am looking forward to reading many more of her wonderfully written novels 
 How you could follow up Flyy Girl with this ish, I will never know. I didn't finish the book. Only thing I did was skip around to see what happened with Victor and Tracey. I dont know what happened with you!! Were you in that much of a rush to put the sequel out that you didn't care if it was good or not? I guess you knew it was gonna sell anyways because you knew that everybody was waiting on this.. Omar you should be ashamed of yourself.. I WOULD NOT recommend anyone to buy this book. Borrow it, check it out from the library, or ask somebody what happens... Believe me if you spend your money on this you are gone be mad as hell 
 Well, well, well, it looks like "Cliff" has done it again.  This fabulous entity has actually managed to create a cheatbook for The Holy Bible.  Amazing.  What's more amazing is that people pay money for it.   Honestly, does anyone actually believe that a person can condense the  entire 39 books of the Old Testament into a little yellow, book, published  in a series known for its inaccuracies.  And this in regards a book so  involved and requirous of absolute accuracy.  Hmm, perhaps I too may waste  my money on this psuedo-tome...maybe not.  I could take some more time and  thought and actually read the book, but  that would require too much  effort.  Oh well, back to my Comic Book Classics.  It's like Cliff's Notes,  but with cool pictures 
 I am not an accountant, I'm an engineer.  I knew almost nothing about about accounting, but I wanted to learn double entry bookeeping.  So before I even read this book, I studied Barron's "Bookeeping the Easy Way".   Having gained an understanding of bookeeping, I then proceed to this book.  And what I learned is that accounting has many, many categories of events to be accounted, lots and lots of counter-intuitive conventions, jargon galore, and an unending supply of seemingly arbitrary rules.  What I did *not* learn from this book is that accounting is very logical, an entire system built on two postulates (to borrow some mathematical vocabulary).  Happily, I share a 45 minute commute with an accountant friend, and he enlightened me.  But without the individual tutoring, I doubt I would have made much progress with this book despite many hours of hard work.  I could forgive this book for obscuring the beauty of accounting, since after all most readers are interesting in acquiring skills, not contemplating beauty.  Unfortunately, this is a car wreck of a a "how to" book.  The text is wordy, amiguous, and convoluted.  None of the illustrations or tables are numbered.  I ended up re-reading almost every passage several times.  Whoever invented accounting was a genius, and accounting is probably one of the most important inventions of all times.  This book does not do the subject justice 
 I absolutely loved two of Lisa See's other novels: "Snow Flower and the Secret Fan" and "Dragon Bones" and recommend both of them highly - she is an incredibly talented writer.   That being said, I had very high hopes for this book but was disappointed. The one-hundred year odyssey of her family is indeed fascinating and the amount of research she did is evident. The emotional journey she must have encountered while writing the story is palpable. As with the above-mentioned novels, you feel like you know her characters and get such a sense of their surroundings- the sights, smells, and tastes of their lives. On the flip side, however, this novel was just too packed with details. It felt like she tried to cram everything in. Certain chapters certainly could have been cut out entirely from the story and it would have had the same meaning and effect.   It should have focused more on Fong See and his life as opposed to then focusing on his childrens' lives and going on and on from there. His story is undeniably both interesting and troubling- it depicts "American" prejudice, racism and the difficulties facing minorities in this country.  However, it would have been more poingnant if it stood alone as the focal point of the novel.    
 First and foremost, do your job as a U.S. Senator. Stop the book tour doing self promotion. How is the real estate issue going? Please explain!! 
 This book was good in giving you the basics facts of Norris' life, but it left me wanting a more in depth biography along the lines of the one of Jimmy Swaggart done a few years ago. If you want to know the highlights, and low lights read this but if you can just check it out of the library 
 A very dissapointing title from Taunton.  Basically a series of near-advertisements for systems you can buy and simply install.  The few do-it-yourself projects look like summer-camp woodshop material.  
 This pendant looks great in the picture but when I received it, it looks like yellow glass, doesn't look like a crystal at all. I'm very dissapointed 
 If you are a cop or in law enforcement this book might be worth your while.  However, you're better off skipping this one; there are too many other good books out there.  Since when does piecing together interview after interview, quote after quote pass for good writing?  I get the feeling that Schulman spent time as a stenographer.  There are so many people, so many different angles in this book that I don't even think Schulman could keep track of it all 
 This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood.  I'm not sure when this "score" was "written", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film.  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film.  With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while.  If you want an affective, edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another edition.  
 Don't Buy it. Be warned. It's stupid. You will regret it is the worst possible thing that has come to musicals and hopefully will be the last 
 I found this book to be offensively un-American.  The characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts.  The best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises.  I think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters. 
 I just returned this book because I thought the colors were too bold, garish in some cases. For example, imagine a combination of black, salmon pink, and pistachio green.  If you are daring this book could work for you.  But if you are an all-white-wall person like me, just branching out, I think you better pick another book 
 When used in the music industry, the term rebirth would indicate erasing the slate and starting anew, and presenting yourself as something different.  Perhaps Jennifer Lopez thought of this knowing that her singing career was in decline, and opted to give her fourth album the title Rebirth.  Is there any legitimate sign of a rebirth on this album, you ask?   A few songs in, and the answer is clearly no.  The songs are still built on synthetic arrangements with synths and samples where real instruments could be, the lyrics are still some of the most shallow you'll ever hear, Lopez still isn't doing much in the way of writing, and her thin voice still sounds the same way it did on her first album.  You would think by now that with all the time that Lopez has spent as a recording artist that some aspects of her output would have improved, but that is not the case.  If the Lopez faithful (who made her first two albums multi-platinum hits) need any proof how weak her voice is, listen to some of the songs here, including the single "Get Right" - she TALKS her way through a lot of these tracks.  That's right, not singing or rapping, but talking.  You have to hear them to know what I mean.  Did you ever stop to think that she doesn't perform live because she can't sing a note in tune?  One thing I'll give her credit for is that at least she isn't taking advantage of her fans by performing "live" concerts while miming the whole thing (like those hacks Britney Spears and Hilary Duff).  The material is so weak that it's little wonder why her fan base has eroded as of late, despite her high profile.  In summary: Not being true to its title, Rebirth is instead a continuation of the weak bubblegum pop and lite R&B sounds that we've come to expect from Jennifer Lopez.  In short, expect more studio-enhanced singing, more synthetic music and more lyrics so weak that even Black Eyed Peas would have rejected them.  You can definitely do better than this album - just don't expect to hear it on the "hit music" station 
 Of Rick Moody's books, I've read "The Ice Storm" and "Garden State."  I liked both of them, although I prefer the film version of "The Ice Storm" to the novel.  So I picked up a paperback copy of "Demonology," thinking that it would be equally engaging.  I was wrong.  I couldn't make it past the first few stories, they were all very thin and flat, and as I was reading, I couldn't help but think, "Who cares?"  The first story, "The Mansion on the Hill," was unbelievably slow and tedious to get through, the same was true as I gave him another chance and started reading the subsequent stories, hoping in vain that things would get better.  A real disappointment.  I would drift off as I was reading, and could have skipped pages and still known what was going on in the plot.  A very empty, unsatisfying read.  Like expecting a steak dinner and only getting a rice cake 
 This book is most appropriate for someone who has just entered the workforce.  Many of the lessons regarding behavior in the professional world are useful, but not profound.  I was  dissapointed in the section of the book devoted to personal matters.  In general, I would not recommend to anyone with more than a passing knowledge of basic personal financial skills.

 Save your money or give it to charity. This is one of the worst films for a long time. The characters are one-dimensional, you don't care who they are and when they die, you're indifferent. The direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory. I was so bored with this film that I can't even bring myself to write anything else about it 
 I hated this book! I usually love Coulters work and her heroes, but Anthony was just revolting! The rape, the beating, everything about the way he treated her, including the whole 'I loved your mother, you'll do as the next best thing' just left me wishing that another character (even Edward)would come save poor Cassie from this monstrous man! He just completely degraded her. So what if he loved her - move on, get over it. Personally I see his actions as a deranged stalker, not a man in love. I disagree with all the other reviewers who state that we shouldn't apply modern values to historical romances - hello? If I want realism, I'll read a history book. This is supposed to be fiction! If it was really accurate he probably would have no teeth and smell bad! Plus, we as the readers should identify with the main characters. Cassie's decision to love the man who raped her just left me cold. My kind of heroine would have fought and made him pay (maybe castrated him after beating him thoroughly!) If you like romances - stay away 
  "One Deadly Night" may be the most unusual true crime tale this reviewer has read.  This is entirely due to the fact that author Glatt, or his publisher, rushed ODN to print far too soon. The following will attempt to justify that charge: David Camm was a former Indiana State Trooper. He may have been a fine cop but it appears he was anything but a good husband or a nice guy. (There are no crimes attached to those personal shortcomings!).  One evening in September 2000, Camm's wife and two children were murdered in the garage of their New Albany, Indiana home.  The setting is a Louisville suburb, not a remote town in the cornfields.  ODN is told mostly from a prosecutorial viewpoint.  The investigating State Police fingered DC as the perp from the very outset. Virtually no effort was made, at least within the pages of ODN, to identify another suspect or accomplice.  This reader had the suspicion that Camm made enemies among his fellow troopers while still in uniform and was receiving some serious payback.  It is almost meaningless that that DC is found guilty of murder only to have that conviction overturned. What happened next? My amazon friends have 2 choices in securing an answer: 1) Do a web search on David Camm to be bought up to date as of March 7, 2006.  2) Wait until the case has COMPLETELY wound its' way through the legal system. Perhaps then author Glatt will produce a comprehensive-and FINAL! - story on the events of that "deadly Indiana night" of September 2000. In that forthcoming final version, one hopes the author will shed light on the urgency to rush a garden variety, uncompelling murder case into print. Judging by the reprint history ODN is selling well but promoting an unresolved case is plainly and simply misleading. For the moment, ODN is not recommended to my amazon friends.  
 As a books-on-writing junkie, I have to say that I had high hopes for the Marshall Plan.  Although there are general plot structures, the so-called scene-by-scene blueprint presented in the Marshall Plan is convoluted and confusing.  If you're serious about getting published I would recommend "Novelists Essential Guide to Crafting Scenes (Novelists Essentials) and "Fiction First Aid: Instant Remedies for Novels, Stories, and Scripts" by Raymond Obstfeld.  Mr. Obstfeld's approach is much more realistic and comprehensive.  Using Mr. Obstfeld's suggestions, I'm well on my way to completing and submitting my manuscript 
 This book would only be tolerable if you like romance novels, but in that case you'd be better off buying "The Notebook". - This book has no practical business value at all. I find its popularity to be deeply troubling. There is apparently something in the current business culture that makes people not want to think. They just want to feel good. The story presents "facts", but no sources. It presents inspiration, but no critical thought, and it doesn't prepare the reader for the real challenges that they will face in life or in business. Rather then presenting Vision from the appropriate management perspective, it presents it from a marketing perspective. This is how we want the public to feel about Vision. - Even from the viewpoint of `inspiration' it fails, because it's fictional. ANYONE can succeed in fiction. No 
 As HARD as I really tried to get into this work by composer Wendy Carlos,I simply could not. 'Tales Of...' is JUST too strange. Just call the music on this CD 'weird electronic'.Liked the reissue for the 'Clockwork Orange' movie soundtrack SO much better(see my review). It's obvious that the music here is classically influenced.Two cuts here I thought were so-so are "Transitional" and "City Of Temptation". Seven tracks,duration is 57:27. I mean if you enjoy several of Carlos's other releases,you get nearly a full hour of true oddness here. Just might appeal to patient fans of Tomita,Kraftwerk,Mother Mallard's Portable Masterpiece Co. and Carl Craig 
 I believe Ayn Rand's writings are very destructive. And this isn't because                      of her highly un-original philosophy. No, the reason for this is the                      powerful grip the books has on her  followers. In her books they find                      justification for  behaving in a anti-social manner that is slowly destroying                       the fabric of the societies of the Western World. This egoism is                       supposedly derived from "reason". In the real world  however there is no                      reason for people not to find  fulfillment and meaning from helping others                      and caring  for their family and friends. The accusation that "altruism",  i.e.                      decency and goodness, leads to tyranny is nothing  but products of a very                      paranoid mind. The craziest  thing about this though is the fact that Ayn                      Rand has  been raised to a saint-like status by her followers. No                       disagreement with her writings is ever accepted and if you disagree you                       are an evil communist/collectivist. To be a true  individualist you must                      agree with everything she has  ever written. Isn't this collectivism in a true                      sense?  No, says her followers, those views are derived by reason and                       must therefore be share by all intelligent human beings. Pretty  scary!!                      Note that Objectivism, like Marxism,  Freudianism and Jungianism, is a                      closed system of  thought in the sense that any critisism of the system is                       automatically seen as a symptom of unreason. This is what makes                       Objectivism a religion rather than a philosophy or scientific  method. And                      this is also the reason for the fanatical  behavior of her disciples. At best                      her books are  useful self help guides, but this is also true of for example                       the Bible or the writings of Jung 
 The amount of praise given to this work does not surprise me given that there is a widespread, yet subtle, socialist movement in America as well as in Europe.  Despite this, the book is a failed attempt at reconciling the ideal with reality.  Rawls commits one of the many age-old flaws of collectivism, attempting to force morality on immoral beings. Rawls' entire work is fundamentally flawed in that the hypothetical situation from which the entire theory relies, selectively allows certain knowledge, assumptions, etc. while conveniently eliminating others.  For instance, empirical evidence that shows capitalism outperforms other economic systems cannot be known in the original position.  This is profound when one considers that we live in a hostile world that requires nations to invest in security of which economic power is imperative.  Thus, capitalism may be a necessary injustice in order to safeguard liberal democracy.  If we compare the human condition prior to capitalism, one can see that perhaps a collectivist system that may contribute to capitalism's downfall is immoral, if it leads us back in this direction.  Consequentalism perhaps?  Despite this, the people in the original position cannot have this knowledge.  Therefore, information that is direly relevant to the construction of a social system in a hostile world cannot be used in determining its structure.  Somehow though, the people do understand the important of the right to vote, equality, etc. This is absurd and impractical.  Rationale beings need to analyze as much information as is available and pertinent to any decisions they make.  Rawls continuously attempts to explain his "tweaks" as rationale but it is obvious that they are all implemented in order to discount human nature and proceed in theoretical terms.  On a side note, Rawls' first principle calls for the right to vote, what would his state do if citizens began to vote for a more capitalistic system that defied his "justice"?  Iron fist?  Nevertheless, it is quite obvious what Rawls is attempting here.  In a hypothetical situation where we all have to fear being born without intelligence, strength, status etc. we will take the safe route and ensure ourselves the highest index of goods.  This may be true, or it may not (human nature seems to embrace risk taking) however this situation is irrelevant because of its exclusion of relevant information.  Hobbes for instance accepted human nature and the potential for a wide array of circumstances in his hypothetical Natural Condition.  While Rawls may have some strong arguments in declaring that his two principles are the epitome absolute justice, this does not mean they are practical in a hostile world.  Essentially, what Rawls is saying is that none of us deserved to be born intelligent, responsible, hard working, but that we were simply lucky in the natural lottery.  Because of this arbitrary distribution, he believes that we all must compensate for those unfortunate souls that were born unintelligent, lazy, and perhaps even immoral!  I'd admonish Rawls not to attempt applying his insane reasoning to the criminal justice system (Poor, unfortunate murderer).  If Rawls believes that the laziest, dumbest, and most immoral person still deserves a living wage despite not working, he has contradicted himself in that this justifies slavery, forcing individuals to work for other individuals without compensation.  This simply cannot be justice as "fairness".  Nevertheless, I'd recommend it to all free market advocates simply to strengthen their positions.  As a warning however, be prepared for a work that lacks brevity, organization, coherence, and most importantly, reality 
 I'm still not sure what happened at the end, and I don't feel inclined to watch it again. The plusses? Well-photographed with some nice moody Tex-Mex scenes. Sam Shepard I liked as the friendly cigar smoking sherrif. Val Kilmer was OK but it would have killed him to wash his hair? The female roles were OK and predictable. The American movie industry again tries to persuade us that a multiple killer/assassin hired to shoot the President; who in one flashback kills a man in front of his child; and in another murders a victim in a confessional, is just a little misunderstood and needs the right woman to set him straight. Aw shucks who couldn't forgive that toothy grin 
 To be honest, i was very dissapointed with the book.  Being chicano, i am ashamed that this book was written by one of my own people.  To me it was basically a slang dictionary for non spanish speaking people.      Even  though i'm not fond of the book, i have to admit some parts were rather  intertaining.  That's my 2 cents. :)  ~And 
 Robert Kennedy was my very first hero as a child.  Although I enjoyed to some degree the psychological portrait of the man, I was very perturbed by the author's contention that the Attorney General in any way engineered his  brother's death.  To suggest such a thing is to suggest pure madness as RFK  was absolutely devoted to his brother and often sublimated his own identity  during his Attorney General years so as to better serve his brother.  I  found that concept preposterous and completely without merit.   Robert  Kennedy was the only one of the brothers that I liked and I believed he had  a lot of personal integrity, moral conviction and certainly a brave one.   He met personal goals and was an extremely hard worker who had a lot to  show for his efforts.  In some way I feel this book trivialized his  political career. Robert Kennedy is an interesting man in his own right and  I think much more interesting than any of his brothers.  I really felt  somewhat disappointed in this book 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 But this time folks I'm here to explain the actual album not all the one sentence reviews you've been reading.  Well Chingy hasn't really been around all that long.  Coming off his debut album Jackpot and the smash hit "Right Thurr" Chingy left DTP feeling like he could be the top dog on his own label called Get It Boyz (or G.I.B.).  Well his album Powerballin has gone plantinum too but it's still trash just like Jackpot.  The only reason I bumped this album up a star is because is because the production is good on several tracks like "Fall'N" the Track Starz-produced "Wurr Da Git It Gurlz At" and the David Banner-assisted "All The Way To St. Lou".  Bun-B does his usual "outshine the other artist on their track" on "We Do" and the afermentioned "All The Way To St. Lou" is decent lyrically.  Unfortunatley Chingy does the same three formulatic things from his last album (1) rap about how much money he has "Balla Baby", (2) the a**-shaking song ironically titled "Make That A** Talk" and (3) talk about his cars "26's".  Yes he decided to NOT only talk about his cars but devoted an entire song talking about the size of his rims!  This album is so bad the Outro is the best thing to listen too where he gives props to everyone who helped him out with the album.  Speaking of help this album is littered with guest stars and they don't do much.  Yes Bun-B shines on the afermentioned "We Do" but R. Kelly doesnt do much with his chorus on "Leave Wit Me" and neither does Janet Jackson on "Don't Worry".  G.I.B. makes at least a half-dozen appearences on here and after hearing lines like "Somebody tell her that i bang c***/See baby i make the bed rock"  on "Wurr Da Git It Gurlz At" you'll want to change that "I" to an A for Get Away Boy!  Lil' Flip even decided to make an appearance on the "Balla Baby Remix" and the sad part is that as bad as the guest appearances are, they're still better than what Chingy brings to the table.  If you manage to get through this 73 minutes of wackiness you'll know why Ludacris let Chingy go. 
 The author attempts to paint some trends from haphazard internet-related happenings. His intent seems to be to say --  The internet changes _everything_, becomes a social leveller. Youngsters are making big changes not just in inventing new things, but also new processes, new paradigms, and oldies feel endangered and rightfully so.  He uses stories like a kiddie making big stock gains and being investigated by SEC, another being a freelance lawyer and making it big fast, yet another writing programs to napsterize everything.  He indicates "flattening" of normally hierarchically defined relationships in society and corporations, and has this concept of "insiders" being unseated by "outsiders" due to the ease with which radical new ideas can be imagined, developed and brought to market, thanks to the internet.  There is some truth to his observations, but the few examples he quotes may not be sufficient to determine a wider trend. It is of course true that the internet gives "access" and "freedom" renewed relevance. I like to think of it as "digital democratization" of society.  
 I read other reviews about the poor disk quality but thought I'd get luckly, which I didn't.  The very first episode skipped and finally stopped altogether near the end.  I tried it on 2 different players with the same result.  Cheap double sided dvds.  I expect more of the same on the other episodes.  A great show treated shabbily with cheap disks.  If you haven't bought Hart to Hart yet get that instead.  
 Bought at Toys r Us for 8 year old. Had fun putting it together, and like I said it Looks cool.  However, you barely touch it while playing with it, and it falls apart. Even frustrating for a kid.  I would expect better quality for $40. Probably will return 
 The story is told in three different time periods. First is the story of Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), a writer who feels trapped in her own mind and in the retraints of the world around her. Next is Laura Brown(Julianne Moore), a woman of the 1950s who is reading Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway. She too feels trapped in her daily life. She is a failure as a woman because she cannot do the mundane things a housewife is expected to do like bake a cake. Last is Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) who is planning a party for her writer friend that is dying of AIDs (Ed Harris). A theme of the film besides hating life is lesbianism, a contributor to the sentiment of entrapment.  The problem with the film is that the characters are next to impossible to relate to or to sympathize with. Each of them inflict themselves with their pain. Each act with no regard for the people around them. Their problems seem whiney and selfish as a result.   Marlene Dietrich was right in her assumptions about the Academy Awards and who wins them. She claimed that when an actress played an invalid, a person with a mental illness, or an ugly person, the actress was assured an Oscar. This prediction has come true with Kidman. The extent of her performance is staring into the distance with a cigarette in her mouth and one minor outburst with her husband.   This is hardly an interesting movie; it drags slowly to peak with a predictable and forced climax. It redeems itself with wonderfully re-created historical sets and costumes 
 I'd be okay with a story that had 1 or 2 last-second escapes, but this book has at least 10, if not more!  I think the author spent too much time watching action films and incorporated every single escape trick into one book.  Even a Bond film would not go this far out on a limb.  They only other Reilly book I've read is The Contest, which I suppose was just as far fetched, but I give that one more latitude since it was science fiction and this one is not.  Another complaint is that a 16th century manuscript is woven into the story - which is not a bad idea - but there was no effort at all to change the language to the appropriate era.  The book does have a lot of action though... so if you like wild adventure and can completely suspend reality, you'd probably enjoy.  Appropriateness:  I would like to have recommended this as a fun action book for teens, but be aware that it contains a lot of language and a lot of violence.  There are many gruesome deaths of all varieties.  There is no sexual content or discussion of it 
 I guess you get what you pay for.  This pedometer was difficult to calibrate, and continued to miscount steps, and therefore distance, covered.  It is made of plastic, and came unclipped easily.  I am a big person, and have started walking to improve my health. This product does not work for me, although it might be a different story for a slim person.  It has been relegated to the junk drawer, and probably will eventually be thrown away. I'll have to find another that works better and purchase it 
 This product is not for novices. The labeling on the buttons is extremely confusing. The instructions are not written for the layman either 
 Like other reviewers listed here, I thought this book would focus on the trials and tribulations of cooking recipes that are half-a-century old (if not older)using pithy, witty humor and comparisons of the writer's life and Child's life.  To be fair, there is some of this sprinkled throughout the book, but as an avid cook and Child fan I wish there had been more.  I think there is a market today for food writing; good food writing, like MFK Fisher and Elizabeth David, but I don't think Julie Powell even comes close.  The Julie/Julia Project is a front for this young novelist who see-saws between charming and extremely annoying in her attempts to describe how her life evolves over a one-year period in which she participated (to whatever extent) in some very profound experiences, like working for the government agency dealing with the World Trade Center memorials, a household move in NYC, dealing with a less than stellar marraige, and coping with very needy friends and family.  Julie, get a get a grip on your neurosis and narcissism and just write!  Forget the food, it's just not you.  Stick to your hoo-hum job, your even more narcissistic friends, and your boring marraige and you could be the next Nora Ephron, or at the very least, Erma Bombeck. 
 I own a ton of workout dvd's and thought I might try this one due to the ten minute interval toning sections. I like to use these as add-ons to my cardio vids.  However, I tried the entire video twice and could not get over the instructor... her chatter was really annoying and I felt like she was teaching a kindergarten class.  I am not easily annoyed, and was surprised by my dislike of this dvd... I am definitely selling this one on ebay 
       Never before has such a poorly written book received such acclaim. Maya Angelou wrote this story not with candor and grace but with a bias rarely allowed to sit on shelves let alone the top of a best-seller list. She was not humorous but had a heinousness of character and action that places her beyond the limits of human pity. This "inspiring author" did not demonstrate poignancy and depth but the crude rudiments of writing skill below that found in the essays of a primary school student.               Maya Angelou has portrayed herself as a victim of fate and yet at best her actions can only be described as foolhardy. In an attempt to prove to herself that she isn't a lesbian (a term she apparently doesn't understand) she initiates a deed without thinking of the consequences. She repeatedly gratifies her ego by exalting her academic accomplishments, yet doesn't grasp the fallacies of her own actions until it is far too late.             Several fans have seen her as an example to women. I must disagree with this ardently. Every teenage girl using her as a role model and demonstrating such lack of forethought puts herself at risk for sexual assualt, neglect, STDs, and teen pregnancy.             My only hope for this book is a quick and discreet cremation. May her name never be mentioned in the same breath as Margaret Atwood or any other great modern writer of either gender, and ANY nationality 
 a Sniper is a highly trained sharpshooter or marksman, the word sniper has nothing to do with a murderer..!! Snipers are military or police personel who deserve great respect ! 
 The alternate title of this book should have been "HOW TO AFFECT AN AIR OF SOPHISTICATION AND URBANITY IN SEVERAL HUNDRED PAGES OF PLODDING AND FRANKLY UNBELIEVABLE PLOTTING COUPLED WITH TWO DIMENSIONAL STEREOTYPES SO PREDICTABLE IN THEIR PRETENTIOUS MUSINGS".   An overly long title you might opine but surely not in light of the success of two such eloquent and verbose authors. I had hopes for these two having started with "Cabinet of Curiosities". Their subsequent offerings flagged sequentially but I retained hope for latent talent. Then this? This self-indulgent, conceited tome demonstrated a predisposition not unlike that so manifestly exhibited by the socially-upward-mobile.  I am so saddened to see that some of the most lauded exponents of modern popular fiction are the likes of Messrs. Preston and Child and perhaps the worst offender of all, Dan Brown 
 This movie has such wonderful reviews from both professional critics and Amazon customers that I was expecting great things. While I agree the acting (especially the girls playing Christy and Ariel) is excellent the story is just too implausible and I got that impression from the minute we see the family crossing from Canada to the US (yes they are Irish but for some reason they have to sneak in to the US from Canada). Anyway why on earth would an apparently intelligent couple enter the US with their two kids illegally, without jobs or much money to settle in the most expensive city in the country?  I know the dad is an actor but couldn't he have settled the family in one of the less expensive boroughs and taken the subway in to Manhattan? The mom is a teacher but can't find a job but no wonder if they are in the country illegally. Yet there is money for private school, fixing up the dump of an apartment, an expensive camcorder, betting the rent money on an ET doll etc.  I can't imagine any parents moving in to an apartment building known as the "drug house" with two young girls and then letting the girls wander about as they please.  Mind you the parents are a couple supposedly almost crippled by the guilt they feel over a third child - a son - that has recently died.  I kept expecting someone to call Social Services.   And the medical situations with both Frankie and the mom and new baby are not well thought out or researched. The symbolism between Mateo, the new baby and Frankie is very heavy handed. Though the film is told through the oldest daughter's eyes  because of several scenes and elements the movie is not suited at all to children.  And there are also several scenes that are really not connected with the oldest daughter at all.   Maybe if I had taken it more as a fable I would have "gotten" this movie more but I was expecting a straight forward drama and was disappointed. 
 These pants have a tendency to split horizontally for almost no reason at all. If they split alont the seam that would be one thing but to ctross a seam and just practically explode even when they fit loosely can only mean rotten fabric and that is what you will get when you buy these. I have lost the 3 pairs I biught to the self same calamity and always in public. Please save yourself the trouble. By the way the Lee version of these pants also do the same thing. Be afraid be very afraid. 
 how can you take the best drive-in movie ever made and turn out this WEAK AND POINTLESS remake that robs the story of all the best parts.maybe it was because they gave to much of his background or maybe it's because they give him a good reason for the chase(wife about to have a baby). in the original he starts the whole thing over a $10.00 bet and nothing more(that we know), so with some of the mystery gone most of the tension is gone also. really a miss step by all involve 
 I ordered this dictionary twice, and both times it came with severe printing defects (dots missing on many Arabic letters, making everything unreadable).  I finally returned it and am contemplating what other dictionary to buy.  Content-wise, it also didn't look so impressive, there were a lot of words you would think it should have that weren't in there 
 Instead of hangers to hold this up they use velcro. This puts strain at the top and eventually cracks the thin peice of wood holding it straight. Great for holding air, not great for holding items 
 This book is wriiten with the expectation that you have working experience with SMS 
 The purchase of this book was great marketing for the author, but for the consumer a waste of money.  I found out just as much information about prolotherapy on the internet and by asking my doctors.  I cannot recommend anyone else waste their money like I did 
 as with anything the so-called "john wray" (not his real name) writes, "canaan's tongue" is bristling with brilliant ideas. unfortunately, wray overthinks and then overwrites so that the end result is something akin to a literary collision of clunks, to put it in an overwrought, overthought way. indeed, if today's budding hipsterism movement--everything from interpol to gawkerists--were anything other than over-hyped pseudo-thought, john wray would be the poet terrible of the moment. as is, he's the blathering idiot off to the side at the party your cousin takes you to because he wants to show you what's "cool" in town. here's hoping wray's next outing will in fact be readable. if not enjoyable 
 Nicholsan's performance is without a doubt superior, but the material is second-rate.  Why anyone would want to make a movie like this, much less act in it, is beyond me.  It depicts a bunch of self-obsessed and depressed people(unless they're two-dimensionally portrayed egotistical and superficial snobs to whom the depressed losers feel superior) doing stupid things and being nasty to one another.  You just feel sad and frustrated after watching it, because it doesn't reflect life as it really is, or at the very least, it doesn't give a full view of life, just the small, mean, petty, grimy, sordid vision of one unhappy screenwriter who thinks they're being deep and insightful 
 It is quite a disappointment! If you are expecting something juicy in this book, you won't find much with this author. Sorry to say this but I find this book rather dry with too much details about only two particular Beach Boys. How the author goes on and on about a particular Beach Boy really brings the whole book down. In the first four chapters I have already lost most of my interest in continuing reading. Most of the time I am skipping pages of too much details given 
 Saw MD and thought he wrote the book, however, it's written by two people with MVPS. Nice, but was looking for more solid information 
 There is only one word to describe this flick - SILLY.  Good for 10 year olds and younger.  Story weak.  Acting mediocre.  The action sequences look very "staged" and unnatural and are unbelievable.  One glaring error.  This movie is set in early California, before it becomes a state.  Near the end of the film they show an American flag - and it has 50 STARS on it!!!  Mama Mia!!  Couldn't even get that right.  The title should have been "The Legend of Zero" 
 First off, I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Secondly, I have not actually read the book.  However, I have studied many religions including other Christian religions, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism.  Also I have read the excerpts from this book provided on the main website.  That gave me enough information to know that most of the information is false or has been twisted to provide a pejorative view point on the church.  As far as I can tell the book doesn't mention the fact that the children are being taught strong moral values like honesty and chastity.  These are attributes that seem to be lost in most of the world today.  Now this does not mean that members of the church are perfect and that they don't make mistakes but at least they are trying.  Moreover, there is no sign, in the excerpts, that all of the humanitarian work that the members of the church and the church itself does every year is ever mentioned.  Well of course not we wouldn't dare paint a real picture of the church if it makes it look better than what he may believe it is.    Here is a quote from the excerpts "Over sixty thousand fully-trained, adequately financed and prepared Mormon missionaries are serving in all parts of the United States and in over 124 countries around the world."  I was one of these supposedly "fully-trained" and "adequately financed" and "prepared" missionaries.  I don't know what the author considers "fully-trained" and "prepared" but I know that I would not have considered myself fully-trained.  I served as a missionary in Mexico.  I arrived there after 8 weeks of language and teaching training.  Being a linguist I also know that 8 weeks is hardly enough time to learn a foreign language let alone teaching skills.  And the reason that the missionaries are "adequately financed" is because many of them save up money for years or their parents provide the money for the missionary.  In cases where the family is not able to provide the money for the missionary to serve then members of the local congregation also can choose to help.  So what this really comes down to is if you want to know about any religious group or any other organization why do you go to someone who is obviously biased against it.  For example, when I wanted to know about Catholicism I went to my Catholic friends.  Same thing with Lutherans, Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims and Jews.  If you want to know the truth about something go to those people that actually know.    If you want to know about Mormonism talk to a Mormon.  You shouldn't feel any pressure to become a member of the church yourself.  But you can learn and decide for yourself if the church is a good thing or a bad thing.  As a final note I know that many people who are not members of the LDS church are happy when their children make friends with kids who are members of the LDS church.  Because more often than not those children have higher moral values than many other kids in this day and time 
 If you visit Ms. Breathnac's site, you will find helpful advice for meditating and a new outlook on incidents in your life.  The book did not offer that, though it proposed to.  Her charity work is tremendous and the woman seems to have an endless amount of love and energy.  The book seemed more like Chicken Soup for the Soul with a test at the end than anything that offered daily guidance and affirmations.  But like I said, maybe it just wasn't for me 
 The concept is nice.  However, the authors use it as an excuse to give you countless cutsie small habits that they like in their own life.  Bathroom Yoga, Eye Exercises, etc.  It becomes barely coherent and quite annoying.    I can see how some people will like it.  There is so much in here that you are bound to find SOMETHING that you'd like.  But it's definitely not an "I-can't-put-it-down-it's-SO-good" book.  Perhaps most importantly, the small changes do NOT build upon each other to help you build an extraordinary life.  If that's what you want, A FAR better book is "One Small Step Can Change Your Life : The Kaizen Way" 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 I really liked the first couple books in this series. I was hooked on "How few Remain" but there is no imagination or creativity left in this series. I weep for it. Seriously. It was that bad. I can write better than this. I will never read another Turtledove book 
 I thought this would be a book outlining alternative treatments and therapies combined with current information about cancer. NOT!!!! It was a thin pamphlet that just told me things I already knew, basically it was an ad for essiac. VERY DISAPPOINTING :( 
 For many years, Middle East departments of American universities including Columbia have provided intentionally fake and fraudulent education on Middle East problem and history to American students.  The Table below lists major milestones of the Middle East history and demonstrates that long before Arabs came in Palestine, there were Jewish states and Jerusalem was a capital of one of them.  In 1917-18, British army with Jewish contingents liberated the Holy Land (Palestine) from the Turks. During the WWII, Palestinian Arab clerics contacted Hitler and asked him to exterminate Palestinian Jews. There prove, that Jews lived there before creation of the state of Israel in 1948.   The 1964 PLO Charter addressed to UN used term "Palestinian Arabs" and PLO did not claim Judea, Samarea (so called West Bank), and Gaza their territories.  The term and national group "Palestinians" have been invented some time after 1967 by Arabs who fooled the entire world because the world would like to be fooled.  They also invented a fable that Jews never lived in Palestine. In 2003, Dr. Nabil Hilmi, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Al-Zaqaziq, together with a group of Egyptian expatriates in Switzerland were preparing an enormous lawsuit against all the Jews of the world.  They blamed Israelites, who escaped Egypt and returned to the Promised Land in 12th - 11th centuries BC, of stealing gold from Egypt.  In other word, Dr. Nabil Hilmi and his colleague acknowledged that all Jews of the world are decedents of those Israelites who escaped Egypt and returned to the Promised Land in 12th - 11th centuries BC and, therefore, have a legitimate right for entire Palestinian land.

 It's not nearly as good as I thought it would be. I got a demo cd from centerpointe about holosync, and just the demo was mind-altering and relaxing. I should have spent my money with them instead. Sorry for the bad review, but I was really disappointed, especially from all the hype about this product 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 From the moment I picked up a copy of GUILTY PLEASURES and started reading it, I was hooked on Anita Blake and pretty much devoured the succeeding books. Anita became like a friend and I simply had to know what the author had in store for her, hence I used to pick up the next book as soon as I get to the last page of the previous one. Sadly, this series also proves that all good things must come to an end as we see in the decline of the quality of Hamilton's writing after OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY.   When I write reviews, I do like to summarize the plot. However after reading INCUBUS DREAMS, I was stuck trying to figure out how to begin my review. The problem is that this book has no plot, even though the back cover may suggest otherwise. This is so far the lengthiest book in the series, but there was hardly any of the kick-as* action that I have come to love in the other books, especially the first few. Ask me what I liked about the other books and I can go on about it. Ask me what INCUBUS DREAMS is about and all I can remember is that Anita spent more time feeding the ardeur, which meant getting down and dirty with any man that was available several times a day, whether in private or in front of her numerous male friends. I am certainly no prude but the sex scenes in this book were simply gratuitous and boring. Anita has spent more time on her back and knees than killing those monsters. I miss the old Anita whose sarcasm and no-nonsense attitude I found entertaining and actually endearing. Will someone please tell Ms Hamilton to bring her back?  I will not ramble on much further, but I can tell you now that MICAH is actually worse than this one. I still have DANSE MACABRE to go, but I am leaving that for much much later since I am not sure I can handle any more of Anita's sexual antics at the moment 
 Take a look at the number of copies up for resale - seems this is not a book that is worth keeping - and I would agree with that (clearly widely held) view. This is 'pop' fiction at it's most cover-enticing best but that's all it is. You can do a lot better than this - even for entertainment. Listen to the nearest politician for an hour or so! You'll get about the same rate of rhetoric per ear 
 I know APR is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there, and I think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine, but it's more of the National Enquirer of poetry magazines. It's a large, newspaper-style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles. You'd be better off subscribing to Poetry, The Hudson Review, The Texas Review, Tar River Poetry, or any number of other journals 
 This is listed as a pot holder and described as a mitt... it is neither.   it's a teeny-tiny sleeve that slides over the handle of your saucepan!!!!   very deceiving description and not at ALL what i thought i had ordered.   but for the price, it's not even worth returning so i kept it and just use it as it's supposed to be used.     but if you're looking for a REAL potholder, check out the le creuset MIT 
 As a long time resident of Franklin, Tennessee, a Southern woman and a person who has spent time at Carnton, I was disapointed in this book. While the descriptions of the house, slave quarters and cemetery are accurate, I missed hearing about the beauty of the land surrounding Carnton and Franklin. If you go there at sunset and walk the land, sit on the back porch or walk through the cemetery you can feel what happened there. I don't know anything about the author, but my guess is that he has never had a son, and certainly not one in the military. I also don't think he has a clue about what happens between a man and woman who love each other but cannot be together. Bless his heart. I get Carrie Mcgavock. I understand her. I did not find her in this novel. Please come to Tennessee and walk her land, sit on her porch and you will understand what I mean 
 Purchased this for my grandchildren for Christmas.............BORING--NO FUN not matter what your age 
 As a gay man, I could not possibly come to Terry Eagleton for help or advice. He is like the university professor who throws his hands up in the air and says: "I can't help you gay people become great critics and theorists; go see Judith Butler or Eve Sedgwick!" Eagleton is a white heterosexual male who has ONLY one thing going from him: class analysis. If he didn't have that, he wouldn't have anything. In fact, all he can talk about is class. Look very carefully in Eagleton's texts: gays, women, and minorities do not hold a very high place . . . if they are ever even mentioned at all. I suppose Eagleton would prefer they simply weren't there, clouding up reality. Eagleton must be a very troubled man: not only is he himself a bourgeois academic, Fredric Jameson is superior to him in every way and has said it all (in terms of Marxism), leaving Eagleton with only re-chewed polemics. 
 I must admit that I finished only 2/3 of this book, I just could not bear anymore, even as entertainment.  It was that bad.  But, from what I read, I advise that the plot is pointless and unrealistically laid down.  The characters, especially the main character and her love interest, are very poorly developed.  What is developed of the main character is unlikeable.  The book has the tone of someone who is talking (i.e. writing), not because she has something to say (she doesn't), but because she likes the sound of her own voice.  Wolitzer does know how to string words together well, but there is nothing upon which to hang those words, which is insulting to the reader. I knew before I read the book jacket that Wolitzer much teach creative writing.  It is obvious from the content of the book that she considers herself a literary giant and thinks that impressive. She should stick with that, her "novel" is beyond disappointing.  I'm sorry but the comparison to Wolitzer to Anne Tyler is laughable. 
 This is not too bad for beginners, but if you want a true method that will change your children's future forever, don't hesitate to read all of Doman's books, starting with "How to teach your baby to read", and following with the Math book and the Physical book. Believe me, the difference is huge, and if you are going to invest time on your children, do it right the first time 
 Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELL and THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MAN STANDING did little for me . . . add SPLIT SECOND, which I just heard, to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller about two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together to solve two campaign-trail crimes . . . I cared little about any of the characters, and there were far too many subplots floating around for my taste . . . the ending also didn't do much for me, as it brought too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly, I did not particularly "buy" the man behind the crimes; he just wasn't  all that believable. 
 The previous books in the Kincaid series were clever for the most part.  Not this one.  William Bernhardt discovered his thesauraus for this entry in the series and his soap box.  Clearly William Bernhardt felt his political views needed to come through - and they do.  Repeatedly.  Made the book boring 
 I tried this and it didn't work. To this day I still am a smoker 
 I read a 200 page allegory to learn what was summarized in the last 25 pages.  There is not much substance here and not much to indicate whether the method described in the book is proven.  
 I'm sorry to report that this book merely presents an outline of steps to take, along with a collection of document templates, neither of which contain any actual "content".  In other words, it tells you "what", but not "how".  If you're looking for insight and real-world examples, look elsewhere.  I couldn't justify a bunch of blank forms and outlines for such a cover-price.  I sent mine back and Amazon graciously refunded my money 
 The title pretty much lets you know what you're getting. It's a grade-C howler but not as blatantly funny as I was hoping. Directed by exploitation film specialist Eddie Romero from a story that originally came from Jonathan Demme (long before directing "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this low-budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the Philippines but set in some anonymous third world country. Playing hooker and small-time drug dealer Lee Daniels, blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the title role, while long-forgotten Margaret Markov is the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely Patty Hearst-like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. Naturally antagonistic toward each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini-skirts as uniforms. Run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron, the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half-hearted cat-fighting as Lee and Karen are pitted against each other. Of course, they escape but shackled together a la "The Defiant Ones" and continue the cat-fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits.  Meanwhile, various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit - the loutish drug lord looking for Lee who stole $40K from him, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for Karen, and the incompetent police (who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord). Needless to say, everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of Filipino women, a dog wears Karen's panties and some of the worst of 1970's men's fashion (one beer-bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face). There is a rather sad ending, but what's truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise. Sadly, Grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the "jive", while Markov is an Amazonian blonde whom I am convinced is trying desperately to be credible. Since no one displays any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except balding, bug-eyed Sid Haig, who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra 
 And this is from someone who thinks that U2 music and lyrics are in the top echelon of rock music accomplishments, next to those of Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, Pink Floyd, Nirvana. Let me be frank here: these videos, with the exception of Wim's spot and the footage from the 1992 gig, are an evidence of total lack of creativity and spirit. Period 
 More crap from Plimpton, the very definition of athletic supporte 
 It's trying to turn straight women into leabians. If more women read this book they will just be influnce by it and start sleeping with women and no more men will have a woman. Don't Jen Sincero even cares about men. I hate lesbians cause they hate men. 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 This sweater runs large the arms go over my knuckles & it's long in the waist. I bought this sweater in a large which is what the size chart indicated for me.( I'm 5'6 & wear a 10 or 12.)  It shedded alot. I was leaving fuzzies everywhere plus I wore this with a tan skirt & I had quite a bit of color transfer. Even though it was inexpensive I do not feel it's worth the price 
 One of the first genres moviemakers turn to, when wanting to stir up a little historical or emotional reflection, is war.  Films about war make up some of the oldest in the history of the media, many of them about battles that never took place.  But throw in a dash of historical accuracy here and there (and at the producers' discretion) and you have a recipe for "classic" status.  Exhibit A: "Zulu."  Nevermind that this is the retelling of a senseless battle fought in the name of British colonial expansion, in which countless men died, Brits and Africans alike.  Who cares that the Zulu empire was as oppressive and unforgiving as any tribe on the continent.  Forget that the ultimate outcome - "victory" at Ulundi - resulted in British control of Zululand and naturally, a barbarous system of apartheid for the next 100+ years.  (As one reviewer pointed out, the Africans who played extra roles in the 1964 film weren't even able to go see the movie under the current policies of apartheid.)  Nevermind all that.  Tally ho, mates!  This is war, and war is classic.  Gather round and hear a tale of glory, courage and heroism... again.  Sure, the heroes in question are fighting in the name of racism and greed, but fighting bravely nonetheless.  And to counter any suggestion that the filmmakers condescend to the adversary, the Zulus are presented as equally brave.  Yes, bravery abounds.  After all, what better match for the white man's unflinching imperative than another power-hungry, merciless (but brave) army: that of the Zulus.  Make no mistake, this war story is told from the perspective of the white minority in Southern Africa; there are no significant individual characters on the African side.  And looking at things from that angle, one would have to spin the British effort in a somewhat positive light, or never sleep another night.  But to pretend that it is accurate or just to arbitrarily assign themes like "glory" and "patriotism" to what adds up to brutal militarism, is to deceive one's self utterly.  If anyone can tell me how the effort to defend British fortifications in South Africa in 1879 has made Africa (or the world) a better place, I will gladly take it all back.    In the meantime, filmmakers will continue to rouse passionate armchair patriotism, recalling the brave men who sacrificed their lives for the greater good, whatever that might have been.  Unfortunately, it is the public willingness to accept these tales as accurate, these missions as noble, and these surges of testosterone as plenty justification, that many more men and women will be needlessly sacrificed for years to come.  "Zulu" is indeed a classic war movie.  But ask yourself: is that always a good thing 
 In brief: The negative reviewers of this book are right.  Rand had problems.  Early Objectivism was cult-like (and that is  carried forward still in the ARI/Peikoff branch of Objectivism).  But this book goes far beyond legitimate reporting on those topics, becoming fairly contemptible.  Page after page is marred by excessive (or utterly gratuitous) cheap shots and rambling.  There is a pages-long disquisition on the nature of monetary policy which is without relevance or even coherence, except to try to paint Alan Greenspan in the most negative light possible.  Even in the expected dirt-dishing sections, Walker frequently makes criticisms that either aren't founded, or that actually contradict another criticism he stated but a paragraph earlier.  (Only one tiny example among thousands: in the chapter on Nathaniel Branden, first Branden is bad because his early self-esteem theory didn't stress self-acceptance; then in the next paragraph, Branden is bad because he later modified or corrected his self-esteem theory, to stress self-acceptance).  In terms of biographical details about Rand and associates, the book supplies little that is new (i.e., that was not already in the 2 Branden biographies/memoirs, plus The Journals of Ayn Rand).  The book only begins to redeem itself in the last chapter or two.  Walker gives an interesting survey of old novels and movies that anticipated Rand's _Atlas Shrugged_.  The chapter only starts to work when Walker, in his own words, decides that "Whether Rand concealed any of these influences...I will not pursue" (in other words, to stick to reportage and not personal attacks).  If only he had done the same in the rest of the book!  But even this much-improved chapter is still marred by some strange non sequiturs and sudden ad hominems.  It could have been a good book; Walker obviously did a lot of research.  But he became consumed by his own hatred...not to mention his apparently resentful desire to promote certain non-Randians.  (For example, Walker insistently quotes Albert Ellis and Murray Rothbard at their worst, i.e., them at their most personally resentful. 
 This Book was horrible!  I heard really great things about it and so i figured i should read it.  The main character is really boring and shallow and i didn't like her at all.  And for her to allow a boy to just take over her life even though she knows he doesn't love her is simply ridiculous!  I don't know i thought that this book was kind of boring and i just didn't like it that much.   
 Bill O'Reilly stole his idea for burying his enemies in the sand from Twilight Zone. His vision reminds me of "Manhunter"-- the Michael Mann film not the lame book he based it on. O'Reilly, tall and deformed, is the Tooth-Fairy. O'Reilly is gutter-trash 
 ...Being a new Premiere (and DV) user I picked up little bits and pieces from various sources and just want to learn some topics that are relavent to me, one at a time.  In other words I want to "skip around" topic-wise.  This book is terrible for that.  You open up a chapter that has a title similar to what you want, and right off the bat he is [talking] about the project you were supposidly building up in previous chapters and referring to that.  Also, somehow complex topics are reduced to a few pictures and even fewer words....[In my opinion,]  Adobes "Total Training" tutorials (if you have the $$$) or the "Visual Quickstart" book are much much better 
 The name of the film is American Hardcore, but never once mentioned are seminal Hardcore legends Reagan Youth, Warzone and the Angry Samoans. The Dead Kennedys, Misfits, Husker Du, 7 Seconds and Suicidal Tendencies are briefly mentioned and in no way given their due. Much of the running time of the documentary focuses on the California, Boston and DC scenes. But how can you cover Cali in depth without delving deep into the Dead Kennedys? The film is completely disjointed and has no rhyme or reason as they move from California to Boston back to California to DC and then briefly to New York. I know the intention was good but the product is subpar and heinously omits bands that should have gotten their 15 minutes for their contributions to this important underground scene. Not recommended 
 However, with all the good material in the early 90's coming out I was suckered into listening to just about every little thing. This has some rather blah songs on it, and the thing is they try to sound like everyone, but themselves. On "Dead & Bloated" they try to sound like Danzig, "Sex Type Thing" which is the best song on the whole album they sound like Alice In Chains, "Wicked Garden" and "Plush" they sound like Pearl Jam, and probably the only song that they do sound like themselves is "Creep", and with this one I have some rather bad memories of this as I remember this is one of the songs I heard all the time when I first moved down to Florida. I moved down with no job, or no car, and I was bored out of my skull, and no social life either, as no one seemed to speak to one another. As the lyrics go "Feeling Uninspired...Think I'll Start A Fire". Now that I was down in Florida full time I wasn't having a good time, and I know even now listening to this song makes me remember those hard first few months down here as if they were yesterday, and it's because at times I feel it was. Everything else on this album was too perverted, or just too long-winded. 
 I would have purchased this ridiculous item if not for the comment above.  Thanks for alerting me to the misleading information 
 This book is less a book of instruction and more a series of exercises for a would-be writer to perform.  I was kind of disappointed. I mean, going in, I knew that, say plot and character and dialogue were all important. I was hoping for some sort of discussion on what makes a good plot, or a compelling character, etc. Instead, Josip merely says (roughly) that "Having good characters is important. Here are some exercises for you to write characters: 1) Take a person you know, and describe him. 2) Imagine that person's total opposite, and describe him. (Etc.)"  I've enjoyed other books more when they've discussed what makes a good character versus a bad one, or a good plot, or good dialogue, or what have you. This collection of writing prompts wasn't what I was looking for, but maybe it's what you'd like? If so, recommended 
 What Prince made so special in the 80ties was his abbillity to create innovative music and at the same time appeal to a big audience. Diamond and Pearls appealed to the crowd, considering the 2 million copies it saled, but there is nothing new or exiting to be found on it. Prince even becomes a trendfollower by introducing rap in his music (Jughead) And offcourse there is "Gett off", a nice funk tune, but like all tracks on this cd, very mainstream. Many of the singles that were pulled from this album became great hits (Diamonds and Pearls, Cream, Money Don't Matter 2Night), but they are also amoungst his most uneventfull songs. It shows that being a commercial hit does not equal quality. Only "Willing and Able" and "Strollin'" are showing a tiny glimpse of Prince's true talent and his willingness to experiment with his music. Prince made over 30 albums in his career (I'm proud owner of all of them) and I'm sorry to say this album belongs in the bottomhalf of his catalogue. It was one of his biggest commercial successes and the album sold millions of coppies, but it is also very "middle of the road". It misses spontanity and originality. What is left is a well produced R&B album (perhaps even overproduced), with a handfull of good songs. But non will leave a lasting impression or define Prince's talent. If you seek to be introduced to Prince music get Purple Rain, Sign Of The Times or Lovesexy instead.   
 There are bugs in the tea bags. Now, these aren't the 'organic' bugs you find in your garden when you plant veggies. These are the bugs that dig into expired produce. There are about 4-5 bugs in each bag. If you want some protein boost while relaxing before you go to bed, this is the product to buy. Also, the tea bags aren't made from organdy. It's some sort of plastic/polyester. I burnt a bag and it melted, turned black, and glued onto itself. Horrible, unethical company 
 I wanted to start this off with a "do NOT buy this game". It is extremely boring and it looks like someone just designed it on their computer and just made a thousand copies of it to sell. Very bad production. This was a complete waste of my $12.99. I wouldn't even have purchased it if it was $1. That's how bad it is. There are different categories like wedding, Christmas, etc. And each category had about 8 different games in it. There's hardly any music and the multiple choice questions flash by on the screen. The questions are uninteresting. If you want an exciting game, try the Shout About Movies DVD games. I really like all the Shout About DVD game series. 
 In book two of the Kathy Reichs series involving Temperance Brennan, Tempe finds herself with dead bodies on two continents.  Upon examination, she begins to find unusual similarities that link these deaths.  But how can the victims be so far apart and yet somehow be related?  What evil force is at work here and who can stop it?  And how is a nun's missing niece tied to the destruction?  To top it all off, her eccentric sister from Texas has gone missing in Canada in her quest to "find herself."  Tempe must deal with whether some evil has touched her sister or whether this is just another installment of her sister's flaky personality.  The murders in this book follow Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas in too far fetched a pattern.  Wherever this woman travels, bodies pop up that no one but her can possibly deal with.  As an anthropologist it is logical that she would find herself dealing with skeletal remains, but it is completely unbelievable to find that as she travels between her two homes that the bodies keep piling up and no one else is available to conduct the investigation.  Again Tempe is a heroine that is difficult to like.  When asked to assist with the deaths she whines internally about how she had other plans and really doesn't want to be bothered.  When she finally relents, she has trouble associating the clues that she sees.  There are terrible lines illustrating this such as "that kindled something...in my memory cells, but when I tried to bring it up the spark went out."  Another: "The mental itch was back.  What was it?  Why couldn't I bring it to the surface?"  Yet 100 pages later she is magically pulling it all together and making extrodinary leaps and bounds toward solving the crimes of the century.  This is my second attempt at Kathy Reichs.  I already own the next two books in the series, so I will read them eventually, but it seems as though this set of novels is a huge disappointment with ridiculous plots and an unlikable heroine 
 This product isn't worth this review, but will give one!  The containers split easily, the holders falls apart if you look at it wrong.  I had a few containers left and tossed them all.  Don't try i 
 the author has talent, problem seems to be that instead of developing that talent herself, she has let others "show" her how to write. i swear, 90% of todays young authors have writing programs written all over their voices. the result of this writers school syndrome is that almost everyone seems to be turning out PRODUCT instead of actual writing. please, all you talented wordsmiths out there, stay away from other writers and professors who think they can help your writing. they cannot help it, they can only smother it. Tolsoy? Turgenev? Mark Twain? do you think any of these masters took a course in writing? here's hoping talented people like aimee bender forget what they've been told about writing and start listening to themselves alone 
 The title of this book is a clue; it's not about plants, it is a plant- of militant ecological rhetoric into your home.  I enjoy gardening and plants in general, and I received this book as a gift- it's really unusual for me to return a gift but I did.  At first I thought I could just roll my eyes and chalk up each eco-slam to an author's license to defend her passion, but after a while it just gets ridiculous.  The photos, layout, and volume of the book are amazing, but it's kind of like eating a basketball-sized pomegranite- there's so much sweet to it -- but too many *@&%$ seeds!  The author has insulted the talented photographers, scientists, and graphic artists that worked on this book by ruining it with her sanctimoniousness.  If I'm so interested in plants, doesn't she think I'm already concerned about the environment?  Ironically, this book fails the plants themselves by associating them with such feelings of ire.  I think I'll use my Amazon credit towards a chainsaw!     
 Dr Sears completely ignores the HUGE population of working mothers!  The book goes on and on and on about attachment parenting and how you should allow your child to disattach from you and not the other way around....well, the majority of the mother's in this world do not have this choice!  Furthermore, he made me feel as though I was a selfish mother for not carrying my daughter on my hip for the first year of her life.  My daughter is very attached to me and we have a very close relationship....yet I started back at work full time when she was 8 weeks old.  I feel that Dr Sears only addressing those mothers that stay at home full time and even then he cautions about leaving your child!  Easy for him to say!!!! 
 This fun little toy is a fun little toy, but its legs, and feet come off way too much.  And I mean alot.  And if you move the legs to much, it gets harder to move.  Other then that, kids love it. If your kid doesn't mind to put pieces back together a couple of times, this is a good toy for you 
 I have ordered several Le Creuset items, and have always been happy with my purchase.  Not so with this teapot.  I cannot use it on my stovetop, according to the warnings posted on the packaging.  
 I have bought a few books on boudoir photography and this was disappointing.  When I see a book, I want to see pictures that I can aspire to.  These photos look, for the most part, like pictures anybody would snap of their girlfriend or wife without regard to background, lighting or any type of effects.  I would recommend "Garage Glamour" as a book for those of us trying to get better at boudoir photgraphy 
 ... but doesn't really touch anything the new digital shooter would be interested in.  If you're shooting film and you're looking for a simple primer on low-light, it's not too bad. Be warned, however- it's a pretty basic book.  Apart from a good few pages on tricks with flashlights, and one or two truely stunning photos, it's a generally pedestrian take on the subject.  Digital shooters are advised to look elsewhere 
 The film shows no action, except a disgusting performance of cutting apart a dead body, and you ask yourself, in what relation to the subject of the film this stands. (Sorry, forgot the 3-second-sceen of a naked young man) Just the head of 17-year-old lads, who wonder why they got infected, when they work as prostitute,  explaning in detail what they are to do in this job and where you can find them in Prag. (Like advertising) You are provided with not the least background information about their education, why they left their home town, why they have no normal job. I would wonder what politics think and do  about the youth in the new EC-country, what young people get told about the danger of deceases at school, and what other chances they have in life 
 I never received product as they never shipped it. Amazon sent me an email stating that they couldn't complete my order as it was "non-deliverable".. Not sure what that means if every other item I purchase is "deliverable" 
 These shoes look great but are horrible running shoes.  The soles are solid plastic and do not flex at all on impact.  I do not have knee problems but my knees hurt after running in these shoes.  They may be a good walking or all-purpose shoe but do not plan on running in them.  I returned them and plan to try something else 
 This is a great read that will have you lol and thinking at the same time. The writer is talented and gifted and can turn a phrase as fast as you want to turn the page. Perspective, compassion and curiosity are operative words in this outstanding work. I can only imagine one of the Wilson brothers playing the writer in the flick. Don't let the title scare you off as once you get into it you will have made a deposit that will reap you interest 
 I read most of this book, which at times were very funny and cleverly written. However, she praises her own mother for being The Perfect Mother, has no financial concerns to speak of, a passel of supportive familial babysitters, and cares way too deeply about dressing her daughter Lucy in perfectly matching clothing.   It seems as though the author's work and family life are so darn perfect that I felt alienated from her and her experiences.  I don't live in that kind of world, I live in the world of wierd families, financial worries, job concerns, etc. I much preferred the down-to-earth, reality-infused humor of "Diary of a Mad Mom-To-Be". 
 I read ''Notorious Prisons'' out of curiosity after seeing a show on TV show about Alcatraz.  I was hoping to get some historical perspective on prisons and how they are, or were operated. While the author covers a broad swath of information on prisons, there is insufficient depth to most chapters. Some chapters focus on a few prisoners' experiences, while others are broad overviews. For example, a chapter called "The Worst Prisons of Today" mentions just two - one in Tibet and one in Thailand. There are lots of pictures and drawings throuhout the book, and many needlessly take-up a large portion of the page. Another complaint is that the book is written in a simplistic manner, which diminishes its value as a valuable resource. It's OK for a quick overview, but there's not enough material here to satisfy most readers 
 I'm an avid reader, but never felt compelled to leave a review before now.  I'm sorry to say the writing in this book is dreadful. It reads like a high-school term paper: name-dropping resources, strung together in an attempt to support... something. I'm not quite sure it gets any deeper than 'horses are neat'. There is no clear meaning to be harvested. No point to the rambling. And the language is forced: steeped in self-help-isms. "Paradigm" is used way too much.   As a companion of horses, and as a spiritual seeker, I find more meaning in an afternoon mucking a stall than in the pages of this book. Still, I forced myself to read it all, in the belief that with this much manure, there must be a pony in there somewhere. There wasn't 
 I think the mobile is very cute, but there is no way it will fit onto my crib properly. I tried attaching it in several differnt places. I am going to return it. 
 I picked up "Rock Against Bush - Vol. I" and was really impressed by the quality of the music, the price, and the message.  NOT SO in this case!  More 'mainstream' artists (like No Doubt, and Dropkick Murphy's) but the quality is just not there.  Many songs sound like demo tester recordings that they just handed to Fat Mike to put this CD together.  But of course, many of these bands wouldn't just write/record something just for this comp!  So in that aspect I'm not surprised.  It's just a shame that it shares a name with the 1st edition of this compilation which is far more superior and coherent 
 I picked this book up with the intention of reading it with an open mind. I honestly wanted to hear the arguements for Intelligent Design. Carrying only a Bachelors in Biology I became aware just a few pages in that what I was reading was not science, by any stretch of the imagination.   People in Behe's corner are complaining that the scientific community is not giving this information a fair shot, then apparently don't listen as they very clearly refute it as bad science. Here is the refute that you are asking for, please try to read it:   The book speaks as complicated as possible, to make you feel that nothing so complicated could ever happen naturally. I can honestly say that I do not fully understand blood clotting at an obcene micro-scale. But what I understand about evolution (99% of people in the world don't really understand evolution) quickly debunks everything this man has to say when he says something 'couldn't have happened.'  For instance: his case of the mousetrap being IC. Evolution is a passive process. No one wanted to make an eye. No one wanted to make a foot, a finger, or a liver. You can't start an arguement in that direction when discussing evolution, because it doesn't work that way.   Someone designed a mousetrap to catch mice. Yes, it was certainly an intelligent designer that did so. So he's already comparing evolution,a passive process, to something that actually HAD an intelligent designer; ie. the person who had too many mice in his house (or her house).  His book is full of analogies like this that are just not appropriate to the topic. Please just take some time to learn the very fundamentals of evolution. Then, go on to see all the facts that have have come to light since Darwin's time (please see DNA, viral mutations and resistance). I actually tell my students its as if Darwin used a time machine to come to the future and stole a textbook about DNA then went back in time with his new theory. All scientific research since Darwins time was not looked at to coincide with evolution. But the facts don't lie.  Make sure you truly understand what evolution is all about. Then go back and read Behe's book. Then maybe you'll understand where the scientific community is coming from.  2 stars for controversy; It's about time the scientific community had a good place to start teaching the people about the world they live in.  One last piece - Evolution does not destroy God. It doesn't have to be one way or the other. Go learn about evolution and you'll understand why! 
 This book is shallow and misleading. The author simply does not address the real root of why people become suicide bombers, in fact she makes up any excuse except the real one. Suicide bombers become suicice bombers due to humiliation, oppression, descrimination and lack of freedom. It is an act of desperation and the only way that the Palestinians have left to strike back at their Islraeli oppressors 
 This book is so beautiful.  Purchased for my two year old daughter I hesitate to leave it in her hands.  We absolutelty love the pictures and pop-ups 
 I finished this at 11 pm and almost got up to write a review to warn others.  Absolutely dismal.  It's unfortunate, though, because this writer does seem to have talent but the characters are stagnant, the plot is drawn out far too long and the ending!  I actually kept turning pages to see if where the rest of it was!  It's like she ran out of enthusiasm for the story and just decided to kill off the storyline.  That being said, if the author worked a storyline with more ease and CONCLUDED the story instead of abandoning it, I think there is potential - just not this book.  Shudder.  Can't wait to return the book to the library.  (Donnette and Ellis are so unlikable!!! - NO GROWTH! 
 Mr. Lord could have written a good book.  He has the tools and the know-how, and he did his research.  He made one fatal error, however.  Actually he made not one, but two mistakes.  The first mistake is that his starting point is wrong.  As a trained journalist, he does as a journalist does - he keeps trying to find "dirt", or rather manufacture dirt - all in order to give us a "balanced view".  One can't help feeling, as one reads interview after interview, that Mr. Lord has somehow picked only the disgruntled, caustic and jealous remarks to print.  The second mistake was in underestimating "James Herriot"'s fans, and familys goodwill towards him.  He treats his subject manner as just another subject, as routine grist for the gossip mill, but Alf Wight was not that kind of person. He was a person totally out of Mr. Lord's scope and understanding.  He underestimated Mr. Wight's fans and family's tolerance for having his name besmearched, and, indeed, his son wrote another book in response, a beautiful book about his father, and in it he easily refutes all Mr. Lord's accusations - and turns Mr. Lord into a laughingstock.  Because anybody who has read the two books side by side - which I just did - would realize that Mr. Lord has indeed made a laughingstock of himself.  While there are some good parts to the book, they are very much overshadowed by the other parts.  There are two good chapters - in the middle - which were written factually - the chapters dealing with the content of James Herriot's first books, and the publishing history.  There is a good reason why this is so - Mr. Lord was indeed part of the publishing business and would have been privy to that sort of information.    But much of the book is exactly what he accuses James Herriot of writing - pure fiction.  It would take too long to point out every one of Mr. Lord's mistakes, but I would like to simply write just a few of the many mistakes Mr. Lord makes.  The rest, if you still want to read this book, you could find out for yourself.  The first accusation Mr. Lord makes about James Herriot is that Alf Wight did not write a semi-autobiography, but rather pure fiction.  He maintains that even if this were so, it would not matter, because the books are still entertaining.  With that salve to his conscience, he methodically starts to take apart many stories in an effort to prove them fiction.    His first assertion - that it would not matter if it were actually fiction, is simply not true.  It would matter, and matter a lot, to both his fans and friends and family.  His son says as much in his book- that it would matter a lot if his books are fiction.  Fortunately for us, Mr. Lord does not bring a single proof that could stand up to scrutiny.  His method seems to be - I don't think this story is true, so it's probably not.  That's it.  Not one single proof.  For instance, he says that Alf Wight's memoirs of his war years are fiction - because the dates are wrong.  He says that Alf Wight joined the army in March, 1941, and was discharged two years later, and therefore his story that he was called up to the RAF while his wife was expecting their first child is a fictional story.  His son, in his book "The Real James Herriot" explains that he enlisted in the RAF in March, but was NOT CALLED UP until 15 months later, in November 1942, when his wife was indeed, expecting their first child.  Is it possible his son and wife might know when he joined the RAF better than Mr. Lord?  Especially since Mr. Lord actually admits that he is going from hearsay - since the RAF would not give Mr. Lord access to their records, claiming that they were still classified?  This should be enough of a blooper to discredit Mr. Lord; however, there are many, many more - so many that it would be funny if it were not also very, very sad that someone could so easily print a book full of lies and get away with it (by prefacing all his explanations with "perhaps" he covers himself from libel, I suppose).  Another example of Mr. Lord's innuendos -  he quotes from one of Mr. Herriot's books that James Herriot was taken aback by the red (and squished) face of his newborn son, and asked the nurse if there was something wrong with the child.  Mr. Lord asks how can this story be true if he is a vet?  Just so, explains his son, animals are born much more fully formed than humans are.  (A horse is born already able to walk as soon as he is born).  Mr. Lord falls flat in the mud.  Mr. Lord quotes James Herriot as saying that 90% of his stories are based on real life.  Mr. Lord asks how that can  be - when the Herriot books say that he joined Seigfried's practice in 1937, when he actually started working there in 1941?  Mr. Lord, I think we are ready for a lesson in English.  Do you know what the words "based on true life" means?  "Based" means "based", not "actually, exactly, fact".  When he first started writing, he was hoping to remain anonymous, and therefore disguised his stories so that the people he was writing about would not recognize themselves.  He changed the location of his practice to the Dales, he changed the dates, he even changed the characters - some from a man to a woman, for example.  He put two stories into one, etc. etc.  This all falls under the heading of "based on real life".   There are many, many more examples of this in his book - where he "proves" that James Herriot was writing fiction - and he has no proof whatsoever.  Not even one single time.    If there is one person writing fiction, that person is Mr. Lord.  Mr. Lord spends two entire chapters on a conjecture of how Alf's childhood might have been like - all based on the assumption that Alf had grown up in grinding poverty.  These chapters become almost a farce when we read his sons portrayal of his real childhood - although his parents were not rich they were certainly never poor, and Alf had a very happy childhood.  He also explains the economics of why this was so.  Which puts Mr. Lord's two chapters of conjecture on how Alf's unhappy childhood might have been like in the category it deserves - pure fiction.  While the poverty of the under-class in Glasgow in the 1920's is certainly very sad, it definitely does not belong in a biography of Alf Wight.  Another mistake that Mr. Lord makes is that he constantly contradicts himself.  For example, in one chapter he spends many paragraphs conjecturing on why Alf was always poor, when he should have had a thriving practice - and the fanciful castles he builds in the air are very elaborate indeed.  And yet in another chapter he quotes a neighbor as saying - "oh, they claimed they didn't have any money but that wasn't true.  They had money for everthing - a tennis court, ballet lessons for Rosie, etc."  This came across as a vitriolic statement, but of course in contradiction to his earlier assumption that he was poor.  Mr. Lord, you can't really have it both ways, can you?  Another example - he constantly quotes Eddie Steanton throughout the book, with all kinds of outrageous comments, yet he himself quotes one of Eddie's colleagues "oh, Eddie always exaggerates, you can't believe everything he says".  And later in the book it comes out that Eddie had had a falling out with Alf Wight, and I would assume that his "memories" might be somewhat tainted by those sentiments.  And yet Mr. Lord accepts Mr. Streaton as a fully credible source.  As matters stand now, this book is laughable and barely deserving of a review - except for one thing:  if Mr. Wight's son would not have written his own biography, Mr. Lord's fictious book would have remained as the factual biography of  Alf Wight.  He would have succeeded in besmirching Alf Wight's name with his book full of lies (oh, excuse me, fiction).  The fact that his son wrote his own biography, and a beautiful and moving one at that, has turned Mr. Lord's book into a joke, a book that his fans would not touch with a ten-foot pole, but Mr. Lord did not know that in advance.  He tried to change James Herriot's fans opinion of their idol, by trying to find "dirt" on him, and that was a very low thing.  The fact is that he fortunately did not succeed, but that does not take away from what Mr. Lord tried to do.  Mr. Lord, shame on you 
 Like the Carolinne White translation of the "Confessions," also carried by Amazon, this paperback does not have the complete original text. Rather, some of the ideas have been selected out by someone and are here rephrased into more contemporary language. That's OK, but anyone buying this book ought to know that this version is an abridgement and not the full text of the "Confessions" that they're buying 
 The glossy photos in this pricey book can help spark your imagination to come up with interesting-looking starters.  I found several of the actual recipes, however, bland and uninteresting.  Also beware that many of the photos are printed backwards or upside down so captions don't match. While sometimes pretty and pleasant, the look of the food is frequently rococo and overdone--the book doesn't follow its own advice to keep the presentation simple and the decorations in harmony with the setting. .. 
 I will add my review to the others already listed here.  I went seeking some light summer reading. What I found was more in the line of mindless reading - the plot might have had potential but obviously the authors desires to write a jinogistic story undermined that potential.  It became very clear soon in the book that there was not going to be any question as to the movement of events in the book.  The characterizations were so shallow as to not be worth mention.  The most amazing thing was the author's apparent belief in this construct.  He concludes at the end that the armies of the North and the South at the end of the Civil War could have beaten the combined armies of all the European nations!  This is not alternate history, its fantasy pure and simple 
 I bought the eBook (digital download) version of this expecting to get the full book.  Instead all I got was the Introduction and the title story, for a total of 13 pages.  I told Amazon about it and they quickly refunded my money.  Be aware 
 This is like the other cambridge companions: it is not a reference work, is not thorough, is not authoritative nor objective. This is a collection of essays tending toward the highly speculative, each around 50 pages in length. They range from the silly to the ok, and none are very impressive. The cambridge companion series is misleadingly titled. They cater to narrow interests, not to the general public. Students who need a basic understanding of Nietzsche before they start delving into special topics will find almost no assistance here. Most of the material is of the professorial, specialized, not-generally-interesting variety 
 Amazon strung me along for months before delivering only one volume of the five volume set.  Get it somewhere else 
 The Durkin Hayes production of Richard II is not very good.  The Penguin audiotape on the other hand is excellent 
 I listened all the way through their first album, and I'm not sure what people's definition of raw rock sound is but this band does not produce that.  this band is more pop-punk than it is hardcore.  both albums are pretty repetitive and choppy.  the song "symmetry" got pretty annoying, i had to move on to the next song.  "flights" is a decent single, but if I had to pick a song to listen to it'd be "Contact" because it has more depth and shows more of what the band is capable of.  the rest of the songs sound more like renditions of eachother.  If u are into a very mainstream rock sound, u may like this.  otherwise, I would not suggest this 
 Agree with a previous reviewer.  Ms. Ivens' approach is disorganized and lacking in any cogent, "how-to" information.  The book does provide a good overview of what home networks are, and why an individual may want a home network.  But I was looking for a complete "how-to" book that would provide information on how to use what I already own.  That is, I am a moderately proficient PC and Mac user.  I already have a desktop PC (WinXP, wired) and Mac notebook (OS-X, wireless) which both utilize the same wireless router to access my broadband connection.  I purchased this book because I wanted was a way to network the two devices to share files and a printer.  This book did not provide that information 
 Although the thesis of this book is  thought-provoking, the language in which it is written is dull and disengaging.  The author uses many references to books and films from the early part of the 20th century,  which not many people are familiar with today,and this definitely detracts  from the book's quality.  Also, the entire book could have been compressed  into 100 pages--the same thing is repeated over and over again in different  words 
  Do dogs understand language?  Do they have their own syntax and grammar?  Stanley Coren thinks so.  Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people's interest and sell more copies...  The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant.  Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs.  When the door closes I'll say, "What do we do on an elevator?" and they'll all sit.  This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, "Look!  They understand every word you say!"    Not really.  I trained the dogs to do this by first saying "What do we do on an elevator?-we sit."  Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from "What do we do on an elevator?" to "Sit" quite easily.  In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all.  So it isn't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it's my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.    Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him.  Why?  Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog "understands" his words.  Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language.  But looked at objectively it's far more likely that the dog's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process.   Coren would still disagree.  He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there's a kind of syntax or grammar at work.  I'm sorry, Stan, but real language doesn't operate on such a simplistic level.  And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.    Look, it's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren't (which isn't always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state.  In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can't be.  It's not grammar or syntax, it's emotion, pure and simple.    Even if Coren hadn't thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he'd know that a dog's brain has no Broca's area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible.  But as with other books he's written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn't seem to care much about the truth.    Still, I have to admit that it's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc.  As a result we're almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists.    I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question.  And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, "Do you love me?" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose.  Does he understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him?  Of course not.  But I know he understands the emotion.  It's a shame that Coren doesn't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language.    If I could I'd give this book no stars at all 
 In "Government Gay" (1997), the first book in Fred Hunter's Alex Reynolds mystery series, Alex's lover Peter is kidnapped.  In Chapter 15 of that novel, Alex finally rescues Peter from a locked hotel room by using his VISA card to pop the lock on a door off which the numbers had fallen, leaving only the shadows of said numbers on the grimy door.  Alex explains to his readers that he had learned this simple break-in technique from a neighbor.  In Chapter 12 of "National Nancys" (2000), the fourth book in the series, Alex is again trying to break into a hotel room, this time using bobby pins, when Peter suggests, "Why don't you try a credit card?"  Alex looks up at him, and says, "What?"  And Peter then proceeds to explain to Alex how the technique works.  Alex whips out his VISA card, but is unable to make the "new" trick work, leaving Peter to demonstrate how to pop the lock successfully.  Uh ... hello!  Wake up, Mr. Author!  Oh!  And did I mention that in this novel - too - the room number is able to be identified only because there were shadows left on the dirty door where the numbers used to hang?  It's this kind of sloppy, repetitive, and extremely formulaic writing that makes the Alex Reynolds series so incredibly tired.  Apparently author Hunter was so disinterested in the books that he didn't bother to worry about repeating himself after only four plots!  And sure enough, there is little about "National Nancys" to distinguish it from its previous three cookie-cutter predecessors.  Insist on trying out this series?  Pick one title, any title, and borrow it from the library.  Now you know exactly what happens in each of the first four novels! Alex, Peter, and Alex's mom get involved with murder; withhold evidence from the authorities; are warned by those same authorities to stop investigating; ignore the advice; barely escape death; wrap up the case.  Z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z .. 
 Ask questions. The book and the movie that followed were both attempts to glorify the WRONG people. I'll admit that the Rangers had their hand in this rescue mission. But the REAL heroes are those of the Alamo Scouts. Look it up.  I won't buy this book, nor will I support the movie...because the only reason the Rangers could participate in this mission was due to the help, and highly skilled Alamo Scouts. There is one book out on them, and their missions: Silent Warriors of World War II: The Alamo Scouts Behind Japanese Lines 
 After reading probably 95% of the Star Wars adult novels in existence, I would have to say that this one is the worst Star Wars novels to date that I have read. The only one that surpasses it is Jedi Trial (and The Black Fleet Crisis is in the running in case you were wondering). To give you an idea of how bad this is, I will number each point (in no particular order). 1. I feel that, in general, the author threw information about the characters at you--such as how scary or courageous or dangerous these people are supposed to be (their actions never justify such a narration, however)--and expects you to believe it.  No actions are used to actually prove the author's claims.  For instance, the rulers are supposed to be so brave, but they certainly never give me the impression they actually are. 2. The 'love' story between Nate and Sheeka is so stupid and corny I just wanted to laugh (it is obvious when reading how Sheeka talks that a man wrote this novel). The author forces the chemistry between the two and doesn't spend enough time to cement their relationship. I still wonder how Sheeka got pregnant--the auther never even hints at any intimacy (other than a kiss) between the two (I would like a hint of their intimacy, not a full-blown steamy sex scene). 3. Kit Fisto, whom I had hoped to learn more about, drifts into the background and is so unimportant (fades behind Nate), I wonder why Steve even bothered to include him in here.  This point is probably the most annoying point in the book besides, maybe the next... 4. Asajj Ventress was NOT scary in the least. All she did was boast about how she would kill Obi-Wan and how much smarter she was than anybody else. Oh...I forgot! She also stalked Obi-Wan (real scary, huh?). I had so hoped, after seeing her in the Clone Wars animated shorts, that the author would use her to her fullest. I was wrong. 5. The battle sequences were too short. Typically I get tired of long battle sequences and wish the author would cut some material out but not this time. The author glosses over the lightsaber battles as if they are just fillers.  I want to know some of the dynamics, not a blow-by-blow and not a summary either. 6. I can't believe that Obi-Wan (who seems to be a big whiny know-it-all in this book--I half expect to see a line similary to the infamous 'I want to go to Toshee Station to pick up some power converters') would stoop to deception to trick the Cestians to turning to the Republic.  It just seems out of character to me.  Obi-Wan is very traditional, by-the-book.  Qui-Gon (and maybe Anakin) would stoop to deception; not Obi-Wan. 7. The story's ending was way too pat. It's like all of a sudden--boom! 8. Snoil, the Snail. I mean, come on! Are you that desperate for a new species?  Why can't authors reuse at least one alien from another book? There were a few bright points in the book: the aliens were cool, and I also liked how the author showed the point of view of a clone bred for war (but Karen Traviss does a much better job in Hard Contact). Also, the author writes a superb short story inclueded in the paperback version (I don't know why the short story was better than the novel but it was). But, overall, I would not recommend buying this book (unless in paperback or used or free) unless you are like me and trying to read all the Star Wars books. I would suggest that you check it out at the library or skip it.  You won't miss any important developments.  Recommended Reads: Jedi Apprentice Series, Thrawn Trilogy (absolute BEST!), some of the New Jedi Order (most notably Traitor), Shatterpoint, the MedStar duology (ER, anyone?), Yoda: Dark Rendezvous, Revenge of the Sith novelization, anything by Timothy Zah 
 Oh did this one stink.  Convoluted and confusing, the buildup to the conclusion was positively endless.  I didn't laugh once 
 This book was written by one of the best in the cardiac pacing field. The only problem is his dry and wordy compilation of cardiac pacing 
 This book started really strong and started dying about half way through.  The first half flowed pretty nicely, the authors all had very close styles of writing that made it really enjoyable.  About half way through, one of the big characters just disappeared and became a minor one, the styles of writing changed, sex and violence suddenly were added in what seemed like a PG-rated book, and the flow of events suddenly changed and left you confused.  At the end, things seemed to make some sense, but at the same time your thinking "What?" Started strong, ended badly.  Too bad too, I really liked Booger 
 all this book has done is denounce women and witches. the writer should review how her "subjects" really are before she strikes them down! VERY DISTATSEFU 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 As an electronics engineer, responsible for education at university level, I was a bit disappointed after reading the book. From theoretical/technical point of view, the book starts at a very basic level. For instance phase cancellation and definition of decibels. I did not find anything that was really explained in depth. As far as I can understand, the book is not intended for technicians or engineers dealing with design and analysis of electronic music systems.   On the other hand, musicians with no technical background that will mainly buy and use a synthesizer can probably find some useful information about common technical terms and buzzwords. However, from my point of view, I am not convinced this book really is The Ultimate Reference for Sound Design. 
 I really have to say that this is the worst management book I read. [...] Moreover, the book is full of clichs. I kept reading it, expecting that the good part was coming, but there was no good part! I eventually reached the end of the book where he says "If you don't try, you will never know", and "don't let anything grind you down", as if these were very revealing statements. This is what we tell little kids, and we all learned this when we were 5 years old, and I find pitiful that the author has no other ideas to conclude his book with. I would never recommend this book to anyone in any business field. 
 This was the first and last Iris Johansen book I will read. I thought oh I need something to do at work since its going to be slow today (I work in a library). So I broght it with me and it was so boring I actually fell asleep! I will not be finishing this book. It has no substance. I do not recommend it to anyone. It is a waste of time and money. Although if your looking to take a nap then go ahead and read it 
 I really looked forward to reading this book, figuring that someone with as much access as Alan Light would give me more of an insiders look into a great band.  But he remains on the outside like the rest of us, instead relying on first hand accounts of the band members themselves as well as many others in or around hip-hop.  At first it's kind of cool to get some of the early stories about the punk scene in NYC, which really branched out from the hardcore D.C. bands like Bad Brains.  You just never really get to be in the studio, or at the writing sessions, or on the tour bus.  It's more fitting for liner notes.  Let's tackle this subject head on and get some good stories in a collection.  These guys are legends, and have toured and recorded with and around some of the core players in hip-hop history.  I found this book to be a shallow take on a complex and genre bending crew.  Disappointing 
 I'm only half way through the book but have noticed that approximately one half of the words are incorrectly put under the wrong element. So I give it a two and one half stars. The premise is great, but lets face it, it's pure pagan astrology, Fire, Water, Air and Earth. There is a personality system called WORDTYPES that admits to it's astrological origins that is much better. But I do suggest reading this book as it gives you the basic idea of elemental astrology. Personally, I think that this system is going to change the world 
 Maybe I have just been spoiled by the modern musicals, but this classic was boring. half the songs were dancing, and that isnt exactly what I like listening to. A little tap is ok, but not this much. I also like to have a couple ballads in the show, but this one was balladless. Jerry Orbach sounds great, when you get to hear him, but even that isnt very often. Why not get The Fantastics instead? This show just wasnt for me. I would suggest that collectors, and classic lovers, get this one. Other than that, pass it over. Favorite song: "Lullabies of Broadway" (only because Jerry Orbach sings most of it. 
 Regrettably one of the more unreadable tomes about Wall Street, "Every Man A Speculator" comes up as dry as a professor's rambling essay, as unyielding as a sermon, but with relevance much harder to discern.  The book is laden with--one might say overly reliant upon--quotes and convoluted, often pedantic sentence structures.  It is admittedly informative at turns, at times socially insightful, but with no joy in its reading.  It compels as a reference manual would, but that's not why we read. 
 If you don't mind "new age" pseudo-religious, pseudo-scientific and pseudo-historical fad "intellectualism" and you don't mind skipping pages and pages of slow moving empty dialogue, knock yourself out.  If you prefer fast-paced "London" based mysteries try Will Thomas' new books instead 
 I was actually anticipating something better. There are, of course, some minor flaws and discrepancies, I'm sure they'll all be rectified in the next edition. But there are also many great flops and extremely biased historical expositions, mostly about 20th century issues -whitewashing U.S. and the West, denigrating Cold War opponents, partiality about certain southeastern Europe factions, omitting some of the most important historical carnages(namely, the Armenian genocide and other many atrocious events which took place around world. Prepared by a majorty English team and a general editor, this book will fall short of your expectations and not satisfy you, especially about the the European history part of which I consider the number of maps insufficient and not too detailed as it should be.   Rue the day I bought this atlas. They used to do better than this. Don't spend your precious money on this one if you're really searching out for something good. 
 I read exactly half the book and stopped.  Based on all the criticisms of the unlikely ending, that was a good decision.  As it is there went hours of my life I won't get back!  The book is silly and laughable.  The premise sounded great - but the book is bad.  Really bad 
 This is the kind of movie that leaves me with little hope for the future of horror. It's just bad. Oh, it's not like the cast didn't try. Other than the teens, the cast gave it their all and wrung all they could from a story that has little rhyme or reason. Wicked Little Things is told through a series of horror movie cliches so old you may not remember the first time they were used in a movie. There's never any sense of dread or any real scares because every part of the movie is so well telegraphed by the use of these cliches. If you buy it, or even rent it, after reading all the negative reviews you can't say you weren't warned. 
 Banks can be forgiven for making his heroine unbelievable.  Unfortunately, she is also unsympathetic and uninteresting.  That's quite an achievement; after all, Hannah Musgrave is a terrorist, lesbian chimp-keeper who runs a farm, helps spring a Liberian dictator from prison, and raises three guerilla rebels.  Banks does a much better job with the real-life terrorist John Brown.  Skip 'The Darling' and read 'Cloudsplitter' instead 
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 Talal Asad describes his book as an attempt to give an anthropological reading of the meaning and history of the 'secular', especially as it relates to modern Western thinking. What he does in practice, however, is muse on the various interpretations people in present and past have given to the term, make some random observations about religious practices, and delve into subjects only tangentially related to secularism (like human rights) or not at all (like the 'meaning of pain').  The book misses any greater 'storyline' or reasoning, making each chapter seem a separate essay, and not one very clearly connected to the one before at that. Now this would not be such a problem if the chapters themselves were insightful enough to cause the reader to view secularism or the importance of it in a new light. But unfortunately, this is not the case either. I don't know whether it's the anthropological way of analysing things or whether he is just too modest: but either way, he absolutely avoids making any judgement or even a conclusion, instead preferring to spend endless paragraphs pondering the genealogy of words and concepts. Every time it seems matters might get interesting, every time Asad seems to make the connection to current events or political theory, he seems to rebuff his own interest in the subject; invariably any mentioning of a moral judgement or a political analysis will be followed by "but I'm not interested in whether this is true or not, but only in showing that people have looked at it in this way".   It may be that I myself are simply too uninterested in cultural anthropology to find that exciting, but either way the whole book failed at even holding my passive interest at any point. The subject might have been a very useful and interesting analysis, and clearly Asad is intelligent enough to make one. But more's the pity that he apparently feels such an analysis is beyond the pale, making the book pointless and contentless 
 I have yet to receive my first issue and it has been over 2 months 
 This is a worthwhile book only if you aren't very concerned about historical authenticity or the material culture of the fur trade period.  If you want to make gear with greater historical authenticity you are better off studying the Book of Buckskinning series by Scurlock.  The Scurlock series is based on evolving scholarship, and has improved with every volume as historical and material culture research has revealed more knowledge to students of that period in history 
 Aniston is just about OK, but manages to leave an impression of sorts! However the downside was that she kind of brought the "Friends" method of acting in this movie too! Also the movie does not really explain some of Aniston's actions such as why she told the store manager about Jake's whereabouts ! Sort of a half-finished movie! Not a well polished product! 
 The Pet Shop Boys can no longer truthfully sing, "we were never being boring."  This is a very disappointing, very lifeless, attempt at being "adult" and topical.  When once they sang "How do you expect to be taken seriously?" mocking pompous artistes who assaulted audiences with a politically-correct "message," so now have the Pet Shops succumbed.  "I'm with Stupid" is such a brilliant and original insight to Blair/Bush partnership (not).  Even Tennant sounds bored and uninvolved singing the glaringly obvious "Sodom and Gomorrah Show," which is "It's a Sin" without the cleverness, the wordplay, the pop hooks and the drama.  Essentially, it's just anti-religious theme tied to a disco beat.  If you must have this record because you're a Pet Shop complete collectionist, get the extended version, which includes a few pure Pet Shop dance tracks that were not included on the basic version.  But do this only if you must 
 As to the best of my knowledge, there were two major intellectual responses to the seemingly endless and insuperable crisis which the capitalist system had got itself into after the Great Slump of 1929: Keynes`s "General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment" of 1936 and Schumpeter`s "Capitalism" which was first published in 1942. Like Marx before them, both Keynes and Schumpeter reject the "classic economists'" contention that what they called the market system wll always automatically swing back to an ideal equilibrium - expecially one that implied full employment - provided only the state kept its hands off as much as possible.   However, that is just about where their concurrence ends. While Marx sees the only solution outside the system, in its bloody overthrow and its succession by a "dictatorship of the proletariat" introducing the next evolutionary step in human history, called socialism, Keynes considered the market system as basically viable. All that was needed, according to him, was governmental involvement by which the lacking demand in times of a slump would be lifted to more agreeable levels. Schumpeter, in contrast, agrees with Marx in that capitalism's days are counted and that it is about to be replaced by socialism, even though he doesn't share Marx`s more aggressive notions: according to him, the present day capitalists need not be dealt with by the guillotine alone, they may indeed have a useful function as entrepreneurs employed by his envisaged omnipotent and omniscient super agency that will ideally plan everybody's well-being in his imagined socialist system.  What to think of the book today? First, it is hard to fathom how Schumpeter could have turned such an absolutely blind eye on the totalitarian tendencies necessarily inherent in a state that not only controlled the political field but also was quasi the monopolist employer and as such responsible for the economic side of peoples's lives as well, in particular when one considers the time when it came out: 1942! Second, it is a fine example of how wrong you can get things even if (or: because?) you know so much as Schumpeter did - maybe that is the best argument of all against the establishment of such a super agency planning everybody's life to the extent envisaged by Schumpeter. Finally, even if such an agency did not err - is it not a basic right - and half of the fun of life - to make mistakes - for oneself that is, not forcing them on others 
 I sympathize with many of Searle's views about the inelliminability of the intentional character of consciousness, and the general misguidedness of philosophy of mind.. but I would ask: is this a big discovery? why read Searle rather than Husserl in the first place? Is his naturalism of any philosophical depth or interest? I would say no. I believe reading this book is a waste of time, as it was for me.. 
 I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it.  Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering. If I had known about the distasteful elements in this book, I would never have purchased it 
 The book was supposed to be a translation, but the author has ended up publishing her biases in the garb of presenting it in narrative form. A quick search on the author reveals that she is a controversial character and that Encarta removed her contribution after investigating her scholarship.   As someone interested in learning about Hinduism, I was looking for someone who could just give me the facts instead of a polemicist. The book was a huge disappointment. I wish I had known about Encarta yanking her piece on the grounds of poor scholarship before I embarked on reading her "translation. 
 i don't like this movie. it's extremely unrealistic. almost nothing ethan does is possible. I know it's suppose to be mission impossible, but come on! Some of his stunts are so outrageus, it just looks stupid. The storyline was bad too. but there was one good part, where he used the masks to switch places with the villain's right hand guy. but that's the only good part! watch the first one and the third one. they're awesome! but skip this one. it sucks. 
 After reading others reviews on this book, I decided to buy it.  WHAT DID I MISS??  Out of the 10 short stories, I enjoyed (and even understood) only 2 or 3!!  No plot, No rhyme or reason.  I read alot and consider myself reasonable intelligent, but did not get it.   Would NOT recommend this book 
 I think Dr. Laura should title her next book "The Secret of My Success: Stupid People."   Julie Townsend, Metairie, L 
 This book did not work for me. I believe that natural chemistry and relating to one another are the hallmarks of a mutual and intimate relationship. In this book, the author, rather than helping readers open themselves up to intimacy and be themselves, presents tricks on how to attract the opposite sex. Personally, I'm not looking to 'trick' anyone into going out with me or fall in love. How I open a car door for a woman or how she should or should not reach over to unlock the door for me as I'm walking around after I've opened the car door for her feels like protocol designed to play 'the game' properly. I don't feel that it's a game. It's about being true to ourselves. It's about relating - being best friends. And we are not peacocks - displaying our feathers at such a time and presenting at a certain time. We are empowered with language. I'm more partial to books that explore the similarities between men and women rather than the differences as Gray does. Authors that I recommend are Charlotte Kasl, John Welwood and John Stoltenberg. Good luck! 
 Sorry, but I would not recommend this book.  As a "reference guide" I really expected more.  Probably a good buy at $19.95, but I'll sell you mine for $85.00 
 This book is obviously not for the average reader. I read it for a psychological anthropology book review and found myself regretting every moment of it. First of all, Linde tries to give to many examples and  restates the same thing over and over. When I finished chapter 8 and read  the conclusion which was four pages I was a little upset. The whole book  was a waste of time, by just reading the conclusion the few points that  were made are clearly stated there without the non-sense and all the  repetition. INSOMNIACS this is a must buy for you it put me to sleep about  7-8 times. Besides that avoid this book if at all possible. You can thank  me for the sacrafice I made for you 
 Forget this Cliff Notes crap! Just read Night. It's a great book and it won't even take you long to read. I wish I could give this Cliff Note book zero stars 
 I ordered this as a gift subscription on May 10. By July 20, it still had not arrived. I contacted Customer Service, and was told it wouldn't arrive until September!  The description says it will take 6-10 weeks. It has now been 10 weeks,  and I've been informed it will be another 6 weeks 
 This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.    
 By the grace of God, this film is truly terrible...  Not only is it devoid of any funny material (who gives these people jobs?) but it also rips off superior films such as Bill and Ted, Wayne's World. Dumb and Dumber is stupid and goofy, but at least it is funny.  Some people may find this hilarious...along with genocide, disease and Freddy Got Fingered 
 There is an interesting comparison to be made between Ingmar Bergman's classic "The Virgin Spring" and the grisly exploitation shocker it inspired, "Last House on the Left" by Wes Craven.  They share identical plots, feature graphic rape scenes, and before it's all over turn average men into murderers.  And yet one is considered to be a bona fide classic and 1961's Oscar-winning Best Foreign Film--and the other appreciated only in underground circles, but largely reviled as cheap gruesome exploitation.  So just how different are they?  Not as different as you might imagine--but as different as art and exploitation.  "The Virgin Spring" is easily one of Bergman's most accessible films.  Telling a simple story in a straightforward fashion, he exposes a frankness and brutality people weren't accustomed to seeing.  A young girl venturing through the woods encounters two men and a boy.  Though they initially seem helpful, their actions quickly become violent.  After a graphic (for the time) rape, the girl is murdered.  Later, the wrongdoers happen upon the girl's home and seek shelter from her family--both groups unaware of who the other is.  Suspicions start to arise and vengeance is sought.  It is a powerful tale of love, loss and the depths people can be driven into--where they become unable to stop themselves from betraying their faith and moral code, where savagery and rage take over.  Bergman's film benefits greatly from a stellar lead performance by Max von Sydow as the father.  Real conflict and raw emotion burn up the screen.  Add the beautiful cinematography and haunting score and it's a winning combination.  But what endures in the story of "The Virgin Spring" is how strong a component faith becomes--when there is nothing left to believe in, can you still believe?  A classic in every sense, "The Virgin Spring" still has the power to shock but there's something very redemptive about the film.  "Last House on the Left," however, is probably more notorious than acclaimed.  The plot, as I've said, is identical.  Coming 12 years later, in 1972, Wes Craven was at the beginning of his career and sought to retell this tale.  It is a shocker, and the scenes of rape and murder clearly foreshadow the "torture cinema" of today.  It is brutal, uncompromising and graphic--and the film was championed in the underground horror market.  Working with a small budget, the film lacks the artistry of "The Virgin Spring."  While it still packs a visceral punch and has the power to shock--what it lacks is depth and subtlety.  The characters aren't particularly drawn out so their actions don't have the emotional resonance of the earlier film.  Without contemplating faith and moral choices, what we're left with is straightforward revenge.  And the film, ultimately, has no redemption--no uplift.  It's violence for the sake of violence.  It remains a historically significant precursor and influence on other shock films without being a particularly good movie in it's own right.     And therein lies the difference between art and exploitation.   KGHarris, 11/06 
 Not worth the cheap price.  Very cheap materials and I ended up just getting rid of it 
 As other reviewers have indicated, this is some of the best footage of Rostropovich on DVD. The cinematography is excellent and the sound quality generally is good.  The sound - picture sycronization is, however, not great and I would hesitate recommending this pressing. The time delay between the sound and action is just too excessive to make this an enjoyable and worthwhile purchase. 
 Since I got RSI myself, I've read a number of books on the subject, and of all I've read, this book was at the bottom of the barrel. I'm not saying it is completely without merits, but most of the good advice are available in  all other books I've read. I do, however, fail to see advice about  meditation and guided imagery as relevant to RSI 
     I read a good short story by Franzen in The New Yorker a couple years ago, but this book is lame, lame, lame.  The essays contain little to no humor or insight- they are just lengthy, boring opinions on various subjects.  Imagine if you can a duller, less-relavant Andy Rooney.  If I wanted to read some loser's uninspired musings, I would get on the internet and start reading weblogs.  I hereby declare this book Unreadable 
 I was disappointed, only because the music doesn't carry over the action of the movie.  The main reason I purchased the CD was for the song that Salma Hayek sang...her voice is every bit as sensual and seductive as in the movie 
 Very poor choice for a cover photo. Jason should have been a man and took off his mask. This is really a book for diehard redsox fans only. The avrage baseball fan will choke on it. Stephen king should stick to what he does best,, Horror. Maybe he should write about this Redsox season 
 Beyond the Influence injects the reader with exhaustive detail the effects of "the drug alcohol" on the human body and brain in both alcoholics and nonalcoholics.  A psychologist author and a recovered alcoholic paint a clear picture that alcoholism is a true medical disease rooted in abnormalities in brain chemistry.  The audience is clearly directed towards teachers who are in treatment clinics.  Page after page it fatigues the reader with information that anyone with intelligence would have knowledge of but never before took the time or forced to understand the steps to take for an intervention, to find the right treatment program or how to prevent a future relapse.  Looking at the bigger picture sparks the idea that it is not only a lucrative business in supplying a legal drug as alcohol but writing books or establishing treatment centers to reap the wealth from the victims even more.    Charles Darwin in the book, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, gives the impression that evolution is about the survival of the fittest.  It makes sense why Katherine in chapter four writes that for hundreds, even thousands of years, people have argued loud and long that alcoholism is a shameful personal weakness, a stubborn character defect, or a symptom of some underlying moral disorder.  In a world filled with labels to counter attack chaos and confusion it is very interesting in how life itself operates.  The world in its natural state rests pure evilness. With norms and labels humans put daily pressure upon each other to separate the strong from the weak.  The effect causes some to fall and when this happens some turn away while others flock like vultures to the "weak" in order to either reap the wealth or make themselves feel more excepted. People wish to be settled:   only as they are unsettled is there any hope for them.     Thanks to Katherine everyone can rest easier knowing that it is not 100% their fault since she does point out that alcoholism is a disease of the body, not a weakness of character. In the future will we ever see the one million march with flags stating that alcoholism is a disease, so therefore its time we started treating it like one? The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled.  For it is only in such moments, propelled by our own discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers.  With this said maybe the norms and labels that are pushed on newborns from the time being born do serve a purpose. In a blameless society maybe it is easier to point out that a river runs through us, and that river is called alcohol, instead of pointing the finger back at ourselves from the chaos that we have created among the thousands of years. The march will never be seen and yes the argument that alcoholism is a shameful personal weakness will forever exist and Charles Darwin at the end was correct that evolution is about the survival of the fittest 
 In spite of the positive views of this book expressed here, I admit that I found it weak and diasppointing.  Not only is Crowley fauning and seemingly incapable of asking any of the difficult questions, but the way that Nixon prattles on diminished him in my view far more than it rehabilitated him.  I have always thought that Nixon and LBJ were the last truly interesting presidents we had - each presided over watershed moments in American political history, each aspired to accomplish some great things.  While some posturing was inevitable, their presidencies were far more about issues than the PR puffery we get today.  The fall of Nixon is one of the most momentous occurences in US history.  How, I always wondered, could such an exceptional, talented, and intelligent man make such catastrophically bad decisions?  What in the end did he learn from the debacle and what lessons does he have to offer us?  What are his real views on the course of US history?  On contemporary politics?  Has he come to view it all in a non-partisan manner?  Rather than take any of these things on - Crowleys pretentions notwithstanding that she is recording his "talking to history" through her - we are served up dish after dish of self-serving arguments by Nixon. Even worse, in my reading, what he is most concerned about is getting treated with the proper dignity and respect (by current politicians) due to a former president, the achievement of which he devotes most of his fading energies. Not only is that boring, but it is pathetic how baldly he goes about worrying and complaining about how he is treated in trivial ceremonial events.  Or he gloats about Clinton's problems.  Rather than an elder statesman with something to say, he comes off as a wounded narcissist with an appallingly narrow vision.  I am not and never was a Nixon hater.  Indeed, with a few glaring exceptions, I admired his diplomacy and the many things his administration did to implement the commitments of the Great Society in practical ways.  He was a great politician and an American original.  What I got here undermind that perception, I am sorry to say.  Crowley in my view is a sycophant, pure and simple.  Nixon saw this in her and used her, allowing his most self-serving arguments to gain full flower in the hands of a 20-something recent college grad.  She fails to challenge him on anything and is wholly uncriticial, perhaps lacking the depth to do so.  There is not a dash of irony or self-awareness in any of it.  Both she and Nixon should be ashamed at this.  This is a lousy book, just a whitewash.  Nixon comes off very badly, if you read the subtext, in his last opportunity to come clean about his many mistakes and offer perspective on a remarkable life.  He barely even admits any regrets, except as it relates to how he will be remembered, that is, he failed to reflect deeply on himself and learned nothing.  Not recommended 
 Dear God in Heaven . What a dreary little effort this is and what a disappointment after A Simple Plan . GReat idea for a very short story. Bad idea for a novel . In the end  ( if you can finish the tome ) you'll be rooting for the plant to do its darnest and quickly  
 This book touts itself as a valuable lesson on the horrors of war but there are many more appropriate ways of broaching this discussion with small children than to bombard them with a dreary, depressing and grotesque tale of animal cruelty and suffering. I don't recommend this book for children OR adults. There are many better books, such as "Johnny Tremain" or "The Diary of Anne Frank" that bring home the point of suffering without grisly, needlessly graphic descriptions of animal cruelty that are completely age-INappropriate. 
 I bought this believing that it was chalked full of "full length" videos of the sweet performing. Instead we get three very boring men discussing a very small amount of information on the band. The three men consist of one of the song writers, the guitarist and an early manager. The song writer has more gravel to his voice than Tom Waits, the guitarist is sadly very bloated, and the manager is slouched on a sofa wearing khaki shorts complaining about how the band should have gotten into arena rock. (He's the worst of the three!)  Just as I was enjoying "wig wam bam" when the video cuts off and back to the chat! No little Willy video at all! They also don't include more than 30 secs of the  "love is like oxygen" video. That's sick to fool the fans into thinking they're buying a music video/concert dvd when it's simply a lame documentary. Don't buy it, watch the videos of youtube or buy a dvd from the UK.  
 This poor frightened author! How very very sad to operate from a base of fear so powerful that one must condemn any who vary the slightest in their belief or approach.  Agnes Sanford did good work and devoted her life to helping others.  Most fundamentalists declaring that anyone different from themselves is BAD are simply very frightened people.  By attacking and condemning others they make themselves feel a little bit more secure in a world that is scary and at times overwhelming.  I am so sorry she is spewing this vitriol in an attempt to feel safer 
 I'm convinced that I've wound up with the used copy of this album that the earlier Seattle reviewer had such a hard time getting rid of. Reading such glowing reviews here, and liking "similar" music like Zero 7 and Tosca, I snapped up the one (used) copy in the store. Disappointing, to say the least. On first listen it seemed, like the earlier reviewer said, cheesy and corny. I shut it off after about the third track. Then I thought it might be decent background music for work, where I have to avoid being too caught up in music anyway. Wrong! This album is just not good. It's almost mindnumbingly repetitive, so much so that instead of soothing and lulling me like this sort of music is supposed to do, it started to drill into my brain like some sort of torture device. And hard as I ended up trying, I just couldn't detect any kind of personality behind the music. It seems almost entirely derivative, though there are some nice effects with chimes and bells or something 
 While some of the topics Johnson brings up such as the mixing of cultures that takes place during this time, she lacks the organizational skills and talent as a writer to make the book compelling.  Her work is all over the place and it's hard to follow especially when trying to use it as the basis of a research paper (which is what I had to do for a upper division history class of mine) 
 First let me say I'm a Steinbeck fan.  I love the majority of his work. Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book.  I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only.  It has not been influenced by what others think.  I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book. I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit in this book.  What I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get.  People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc.  This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read.  And where is the plot?  There isn't one.  This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round.  This book is a statement, that's for sure.  Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement.  I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently.  I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country.  That is wrong.  I don't feel that way.  I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!) It's not the politics of this book that I don't like. To me, there were no surprises.  None.  Not like "Of Mice And Men" or "East Of Eden" or other fine books I've read by Steinbeck.  Still, if your a Steinbeck fan, you must read this book.  If you've read his bio you must read "Grapes Of Wrath" to understand why Californians hated him so much.  In a way I feel I have to apologize for not liking this book.  One friend of mine who is an avid reader told me he didn't really care for Steinbeck novels, but he loved "Grapes Of Wrath".  Go figure 
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 I got this book not too long ago based on some of the reviews here.  Like everyone else I want to get to the bottom of the terrorist attacks on 9/11.  I thought maybe this book would have the answer.  Well going through it the book does make a lot of sense.  I can understand the attraction of the oil money and the involvement of politicians and other powerful figures.   But it kind of falls down when you look at the truth behind it.  Some of the people in the book have taken the authors to court over what it says.  And as far as I can tell the result was that the authors were wrong.  Now I know it would be kind of hard to show that someone or other paid for the Twin Towers attacks and so on but you would think there would be enough to get it to hold up in court.  But I am wrong about that!  So this book is kind of the twin to Fahrenheit 911.  A lot of interesting stuff but you don't know if it is true or not.  I tried looking at Brisard's company site and it seems to be shut down.  I saw a web page that said one of the court decisions against him also included shutting down the company.  Now what I find really sad about this is that Brisard was helping the families of the 911 victims sue the terrorists.  The US cannot even catch Ben Laden so it made sense to me that you could sue the Saudis and so on to get some justice.  But I for one have to wonder if the court actions against Brisard are going to make it just a little harder for the families to get their fair day in court.  All in all the book is worth reading as it is pretty interesting even today but you just have to wonder how much is really true 
 I love Tommy Emmanuel..but the previously released DVD in concert is much more to my liking...Tommy playing his great repetoire of standards and originals like nobody else in the world!  This DVD has him singing too  many songs and  a guest female vocalist on at least 4 numbers....I allmost feel its misleading to not have her name on the front of the DVD!  There are many better singers in the world...few better guitarists...stop singing and play 
 The cover and title sure does fool you.  Best Friends.  Looked like a great book for people like me that enjoy stories about how friends meet and make their journey through life together.  But this book was confusing as far as jumping around.  Porn?  Come on, give me a break.  This book is freakish, yet I read the whole thing... too long and I yet have to know what the entire point of the book was.  These characters were disturbing to me and instead of the title "Best Friends"... try "Selfish Psychos".  Do not waste your time and get this book.  If you are truly interested, see if your local library has it... that way you save your money.  Most terrible book EVER!  OH and my copy of the book had sections to where the letter "x" was replaced by the letter "y".  Nice proofreading 
 This book is soooo terrible! not worth reading AT all! First off, you have this image in your head of this guy and a girl... but Frank gets these people in HIS very own sdtory mixed up.... the genders you never are quite sure of since one is suppose to be a girl, but suddenly changes to "he says" "she says" crap! Frank get your chacacters sexes' straight before right a book. This was the biggest waist of time in my life to even read a sentance of any of his books! Just absolutely terrible!!!!!!!!!! Read it and waist time and money on something as pathetic as this book, you'll see what i mean. 
 I was looking for a bit of reasurrance and guidance for alternative treatments.  I certainly didn't get it here!  Ms. Sheehy has few suggestions for perimenopausal women other than HRT, which she describes as almost magical.  Since I have a family history of breast cancer, and--consequently-- no desire to try HRT, I needed books with a more positive tone and other treatment options.  I would strongly recommend Dr. Susan Love's Hormone book and The Pause by Lonnie Barbauch instead 
 I had power point presentation before and I like to purchase new one, however this microsoft power point presenter was so bad. It works so badly. bad mouse movement, it doesn't go to next slide even though push several time right in front of the receiver.  Try not to buy this product. I thought price and range was good but it doesn't really work at all.   By the way, the seller sent me the product pretty fast and good condition 
 This book is a total waste of time and effort!!!!   It is poorly written and very vague.  Also, its information is too old!! 
 After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to reading this book. I thought "finally, a book on communication between couples from a male perspective." I was expecting a sympathetic account of the communication between the sexes but such an account was missing in this book.  This book is s not meant for any man born after about 1960. The gender stereotypes are still very strong (both male and female).  The book starts with some helpful suggestions (don't criticise too often, set a time aside to share criticism) but then quickly deterriorates into a rant about how men have not been treated fairly in the media. Topics covered included abuse within the family (men are abused too) and male-bashing in greeting cards. One important missing topic from this list is the villification of men as pedofiles-- especially men who enjoy working with children.   Of course men can be abused by their wifes, and father's by their children but it does not mean that male on female violence is "okay". Rather than making the non-sensical argument that "we hurt too, so your hurt is fine," the author should condemn abuse in all it's forms. Similarly making fun of men just because they are men, is as okay as making fun of women just because they are women.   I have also wondered why there are very few programs for male perpetrators of violence. Most resources are for women, and the way to solve family abuse, is for the woman to leave. Where are the centres to help men communicate non-violently? Why can't the family try and heal together? In the first part of the book, the author identifies that female "fear" is often translated into male "aggression"-- good point, but why is this point not carried onto the discussion of abuse?  Then there is a list of traditional "unnoticed" male work, including being an unpaid bodyguard "in public places (who plays bodyguard when nightfall turns a beautiful park into a dangerous park", just as well a woman can be an "unpaid massager" for rubbing her husband's shoulders. Most of the other "male work" is incredibly gender specific and even a quick read makes it clear that these are special events (putting up the Christmas lights) rather than day-to-day toil. I found this list offensive. We both cook dinners, use the barbaque and put up the Christmas lights.  There is also the male role of "option generating"-- man asks where they should go for dinner, woman says "anywhere", man says "italian?" etc. Apparently "option-generating often involves having one's ideas rejected, which can be emotionally taxing." The beauty of being in a couple is that both parties can create options and both can reject. It's called communication and making choices together.  More than that, I find it offensive that the author glosses over all the important work men do in families. Men now do change diapers, take pride in being fathers, cook, clean and are partners also in the home. How has this development passed the author by? By enforcing the gender stereotype of "the man brings in the bacon", the author is also glossing over all the men, who might like to stay at home with their children... or who would like to work part-time to have more family time. As well as of course all the women, who might like to have a career.  Many of these choices should be made in the family. Gender stereotypes are truly just as damaging to men, especially because they limit the choices that can be considered "acceptable". Why can a man not enjoy spending time with his children? Why does he need to be able to support the family? Should the responsibility not be shared? Where are the men, who are single parents? Male kindergarten teachers? Heaven forbid.  One more irritating passage: "We often think that when a man insults another man by calling him a 'girl', the insult reflects a contempt for women. No. It reflects a contempt for any man who is unwilling to make himself strong enough to protect someone as precious as a woman." hmmm. yeah... hmmm. This is where I started to laugh out loud. Too ridiculous for words.  In short: this book is not for anyone, who is trying to be a father in this century. Rather than solving anything, this book just perpetuates detrimental and dangerous gender stereotypes. Perhaps the author lives in this kind of a world (and indeed much of the material seems to stem from his personal experiences), but I don't know any young man who would... Rather young men now are facing the same challenges of work-life balance as young women are.  It's time to get beyond male-hating and female-hating, juxtaposing male needs and female needs to find somekind of a inherent conflict, and to understand that men and women can live together. And that in a family, men and women have the same goal-- of making their families as happy as they can. 
 Hawaii for Dummies was not usable and light when it came to driving details.  We should have splurged and bought a book for each of the islands we visited:  Kauai, Oahu and Maui.  Now you know 
 I wanted a monitor for digital photography that was a little better than the bottom end offerings.  I decided on the Viewsonic.  When I received it there was a permanent green pixel right in the middle of the display, and a 3/8" light banding strip at the top.  Amazon was VERY helpful with the return process, even covering the return shipping.  It seems that bad pixels in new monitors can be considered 'normal', but right in the center is unacceptable.  I have seen this monitor in operation, and as long as there are no pixel problems, it looks great 
 Mine ended up in the trash can, that oughta tell ya somethin! 
 How is it that narada can pick over tons of albums and not come up with better compilations?This album is boring and the music is not even real flamenco.If you want authentic Spanish guitar music check out any number of awesome classical recordings by Julian Bream or John Williams and their performance of the works of Rodrigo,Sor,Albeniz,Granados,DeFalla,Sanz,Milan,Mudarra,and numerous traditional works 
 Nice coffee table book, but a great deal of Mails' stuff is either made-up or borrowed from squirrely popular romanticizations of Cherokee folks.  For a general if ideologically out-dated history, see Grace Steele Woodward, for culture see Mooney, Theda Perdue for work specifically on women, and for straight-up historical scholarship, try William McLoughlin's stuff 
 I read to Repel Ghosts and thought it was okay. It is a bit phony for someone like Kevin Young who comes from such a privileged life to write about street life as if he had ever experienced it. I sure did and this book felt like it totally romanticized Basquiat. I found little in Kevin Youngs own words. This book simply gives you a safe and untrue moment that is in a way enough for many, but not sincere enough for me 
 At least 2/3 of this book (hundreds of pages) consists of "Real-Time Commentary", "After-Action Critique", and a corresponding chart for trades that he has placed.  I agree that tracking and analyzing trades is important, but this is clearly overkill and appears to be used because a longer book was desired.  In the remaining pages, the content is poorly organized and shallow.  There is nothing new in this book, which was published in 2003.  Mistakes that the author makes like calling a moving average a trend line don't inspire much confidence in his overly-simplistic Three-Point System, which simply enters a position in the direction of the long term trend if either the short or medium trend is also moving in that direction.  One of the worst books on trading that I have ever read 
 after get shorty, e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again, with this single-minded purpose focused, e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty. and he was right again, it was bought and made into a movie again, but pathetically, a horrible one compared to get shorty. the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind. i simply failed to find there's any interest in reading this going nowhere story. it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie, with all the bore-to-death script, dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap. how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles, especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty'? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose'? and at every corner of los angeles, every table in any restaurant, almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer'? and you have to ask yourself: since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer, even a director in person? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are? yeah, maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show? give me a break! this book, from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer, so shallow and so superficious! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in 
 Chris Byron's schtick is to pretend to be a friend of Martha Stewart, but tell her story in the most cruel light.  No friend would write a book like this.  Hence, from the start one feels he is disingenuous while trying to establish his cred.  I am probably the one person in America who knows almost nothing about Martha Stewart, but Byron's account assembles such a string of digs that before long it gave me the feeling of being stuck in an elevator where someone had vomited. Why subject yourself to this?  I skipped ahead a few times trying to find a different tone, but the guy continues his vicious ways while feigning disinterested storyteller, and I finally had to throw it down.    I do not understand this writer's motivations for such unkindness.   This book makes me wonder about the value of all such book. By what standard is a book considered a good book? Does it inspire us?  Yes, it is well researched and well written... but so are so many others.  This book is disrespectful to a fellow human being and for what purpose?    With so many other books in my reading pile, I have to skip out and move to the next.       
 "Here's a bubble-gum wrapper, a piece of string, and some ordinary gravel. Using these, I'm going to prove that YOU did it."  The leaps and stretches of Logic and common sense that this show uses are way past anything reasonable. Intelligence is tortured by these scripts worse than the prisoners at Guantanamo.  Again, almost every case starts off way too small to warrent a "Major Case Squad" involvement.  Gorman is very much the know-it-all of 70s Doctor Who, with Eemes as his sounding-board "What's that, Doctor" "Doctor, I don't understand" companion. Gorman is too perfect, too knowledgible, too good to be real. He knows everything about everyone, and he's nice enough to work and risk his life to help people on a government salary.  Of the various L&O franchises, this isn't the worst (that would be Trial By Jury), but it's next on the list 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 Kellerman's last few books have been forgettable to say the least and I hoped that this would display the quality of his early writing.  While it was not a total waste of time, it came close.  Far too much print was devoted to the half-hearted team meetings of people in mud colored clothing as they outlined ever more convoluted theories as to who had done what to and with whom.  This  is yet another book that lacks credibility or suspense.  
 This book was a waste of my time. The main charachter, Lee, was so strung out on drugs and/or her own manic depressive behavior that its very difficult to find sympathy to her struggles. She spends every cent she earns or is gifted on drugs or stupidity. Her life (which never seemed very 'glamerous' to me, but then again, I've never been a druggie so perhaps I can't relate) is a disaster from the get go and has no redeeming values. The plot of this book is slow to non-exsistant and the incoherentness of the main charachter makes whatever plot there is nearly impossible to follow let alone get into 
 It would be impossible for me to write you a review.  I never received the subject CD.  You sent me some piece of crap dics which I sent back.  I have not received the Gene Watson CD i ordered and paid for.  If I don't get it soon, you will never hear from me again.  Edward N Clark - Herrin, I 
 HORRIBLE! The dialogue is extra stupid and corny and the storyline extra empty and the cussing extra filthy..I have read all the UNDEAD books but this is the worst..I think MaryJanice wrote this one on the can~ 
 The author of this book was obviously not applying "emotional intelligence" principles when writing this book.  The points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important, but it was just not done in a good manner.  I do not typically shy away from long books, but this one was impossible.  It was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization (we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book), and can I tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing?  Just know that to be successful, you HAVE to exhibit emotional intelligence and be a intuitive, kind and generally good person to work with. If you don't believe me, save yourself the time/energy and buy the Cliffs notes 
 not a book for students or researc 
 In recycling Blakney's translation from the 1950's, Signet is trying to get something for nothing, namely, your money for a lousy out-dated translation.  Not only does Blakney misread the Chinese grammar in several places, his interpretations are both under-thought and under-written.  If an inexpensive translation is what you're looking for, Penguin has a $5 D.C. Lao translation that isn't all that bad.  If, however, you want really excellent translations, here's my advice:  For a more interpretive Neo-Taoist reading, pick up Victor H. Mair's.  This is a good place to start reading the Tao Te Ching, in my opinion.  If, however, you want a truly excellent translation, Philip J. Ivanhoe has done quite nicely.  Moss Robert's translation is just as good overall, but also includes notes on the differences between the MaWangDui and Guodian texts compared to the Wang Bi (which is what he and everyone translates), so that'd be my ideal choice.  Don't buy this book, it's a cheap way for the publishing house to try and score some sales from nothing at all. 	I'm currently working on a research piece on translations of P'u in the English texts, so these critiques come as the result of my working with all these books 
 American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her 
 I live on the Vineyard and let's just say, this cook book does not represent island living in the least. The island is filled with an eclectic mix of people but you would never know it by this book. It tries a little too hard, says very little, is not innovative and seems to feel that it is better than the rest of us by showing some pictures and recipes of some celebrities and those who like to hang out with them. I have tried many of the recipes and few are memorable. The chatter written by the authors of the book and of each individual recipe seems overwritten and trite. Give me some humor, some grit, some wit. These are some pretty self-absorbed people. Lighten up, people. Let's hope this is the LAST of this series... 
 I really enjoyed The Perfect Storm.  So, I gave Ms. Greenlaw the benefit of the doubt and started her book.  I was less than impressed.  I lasted till page 53 where I just ran out of patience with her plodding technique and her lack of story. This is a bad book attempting to ride on the tail of Junger's book.  Sebastian Junger's blurb on the cover was "Anyone who loves the sea will love this book"  I think not 
 I ordered this book after seeing all these reviews praising the information on growing with hydroponics and was pretty disapointed to see that there were only 8 pages dedicated to that system. Still I guess it was better than the 4 pages dedicated to growing in soil 
 I would definitely say this is Survivors worst season.  The problem lies in premise of men vs. woman, which had just been done in Amazon, and I was hoping would never be done again since it was boring the first time.  In Vanuatu it was even worse, since woman, in my opinion, seem to play survivor as a battle of the sexes anyways.  There is no reason to encourage it by starting the game that way.  Add to that, 2 of the woman are lesbians who dont want any part of the men anyways, and you have a recipe for boredom,  which is exactly what this season cooked up.    The "exotic" location seemed dull and boring, with the exception of the eruption/ earthquake that was cool.  Another problem is just in the players themselves, most were annoying, and all the likeable characters were soon eliminated.  The one shining star, in my opinion was Rory(sp) who started of annoying and then let lose and captured the game for several episodes.  Unfortunately, due to the position he was in he was doomed, and was soon voted out. Sorry about the spoiler but you should not waste your time with this season anyways.  I did think this season had one of the better final challenges.  But once again I am disappointed by the lack of extras that could be included in any survivor dvd set, I would like to see more interviews, more cut scenes and tribe life. Oh well, where is Thailand and Amazon? 
 I have tried. I really have. And I admire the writer but other than brief flashes in the hundred or so pages I read, the book is stultifyingly boring. There is a wonderful story here that gets so bogged down in continuous reportage and research; makes me wonder, what is the writer trying to hide, because what is so important about this story gets lost; obscured by the maddening overexplanation and baroque rendering of items,details,people and events. Is all this necessary? What do you leave in and what do you leave out? I would say, from what I read, leave out half of it. Talese, maybe it's his father's fault, wants to spend half a year, in reality it took him something like thirteen years to produce this book, making a custom made suit that he spends countless hours tearing out and restiching, redesigning, etc. What he ends up with is no better than something store bought. I think what is mainly missing from this work is an essentiall passion. Let me explain. I think Talese has it, or how else could he devote so much time and effort to this project, but he has successfully killed it. He gets so lost in his own brilliance that he fails to tell a good story. This is a dead book, kind'a like a beautiful flower preserved; the color faded,with no scent. The book doesn't live and I could'nt read it, and as any kind of example of creative non-fiction, or literary journalism, I have to go against most of the reviews of the book. I wouldn't call it a waste of time but I want something where the author hasn't killed the drama of the story with mortifying detail and unnecessary sidebars 
 This movie is so bad. It is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems. The only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character, a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities. The movie tries hard to invent new "teen speak" with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much, they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie's fans live the life nowhere close to cher's and look nothing like her but they want to pretend. The movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every 15 seconds, desprate to beat you over the head with them. In the movie, the main character, Cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her. Nasty! She is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer. She's supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end, she's like Ella May Clampet going after Jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out. 
 well, i thought that the book was coming. when i did not arrive at the last possible date i emailed and was told it was on backorder.  they did let me get a refund which was nice.  i would use them again for that reason alone.  
 Brannagh's film version of Hamlet blows away every other version, as well as every other Shakespeare based film. It's an easy 5 stars.  Now the DVD is a different matter.  Been hearing about and waiting for this for ages! Every lame-oh shlock film holywood cranks out shows up on DVD and usually big projects like this are milked for every $ they can get with fancy packaging and special editions.    I was part of the project through which a small determined group of fans was able to bring the one season wonder "My So-Called Life" to DVD and there must be close to as large an audience for this.  WHERE IS IT 
 I saw this movie yesterday thinking it'd be exciting. I sure am glad that I survived after watching this terrible excuse for a movie. There's no story line, the acting is pathetic, whoever gave Vin Diesel the idea that he can act. Like an earlier reviewer observes it's about who's dumber the guys who made this movie or the ones who gave it a good review 
 The amount of violence in this book is excessive over relatively insignificant motives.  I had a hard time believing all this was happening in 1948.  I am not questioning Mosley's portrayal of racism.  However, I did a little research into just how violent place Los Angeles was in 1948, and the answer is not very.  There may have been poverty, racism, alcholism, but L.A. county seemed pretty safe; the late 1940s had some of the lowest homicide rates since as far back as one researcher was able to find, 1827!  Mosley may have been more familiar with L.A. of the 1970s and 1980s and just assumed that it had always been that way.  Throw in speakeasies, gangsters hijacking liquor trucks, and one gets the impression that Mosley is confusing the 1948 with 1928.  I am not so pedantic as to insist that fiction be historically accurate.  But many, many people hail Mosley for depicting a dark side of life/era/place that had not been shown before.  From what I can tell, he has simply combined stereotypes from the 1920s and 1970s (I guess those years average to be about 1948).  Mosley is depicting a fantasy world of his own creation.  However, I doubt he ever tried to pass it off as authentic, and I hope readers realize that it is not.  Easy Rawlins in this novel falls into the rather weak, but unfortunately large, group of fictional detectives that actually accomplish little detecting.  A detective actually solves a mystery using his own intellect; that is interesting to read.  Detectives in less skilled hands solve mysteries via  confession.  Easy does solve one of the murders on his own, but just about everything he "solves" is simply confessed to him.  I find that extremely dissatisfying.  Mosley has packed the book with violence, but seems to know very little about violence himself.  None of the fights are well described.  Easy, for being a self-professed "killing machine" can't actually fight worth a damn and is surrounded by guns but does not apparently know anything about them.  They are either big or they are small.  He does not come of as being hard-boiled, but rather a pathetic braggart  Mosley does show signs of being a very good writer.  But I think he is too far over his head in this genre to come up with something exceptional.  I imagine that his work must have improved, but this effort is nothing to get exceited over.  And again, I don't obsess over accuracy, but a little bit of research would have gone a long way in firming the foundation of this novel. 
 I'm a finance undergrad and currently in an MBA program and had to use this book for my advanced topics in finance class.  The book is a difficult read. Hard to mow your way through the subjects and come out feeling like you learned something.  CD is only mildly helpful.  I also purchased the study guide and it was just as poorly designed/organized/written as the book.    If you have to use the book for a class, plan on getting one of Aswath Damordaran's books to supplement it. Damordaran is just hands down a better teacher, author and makes finance fun again. 
 lack of talent leads to jealousy that inspired the author to create his "theories". 
 This book explores a phenomenon termed "psychic vampirism".  Specifically, it deals with people who limit the energy and auras of others via vampiric tendencies that sometimes augment their own energy and aura.  Amazing.  However, the author does not cite a lot of evidence to support his claims.  As a Ph.d. I would imagine that he would be accustomed to supporting all of his claims with facts.  The problem with this book is that while there are some intriguing clues into psychic vampirism, the author combines reincarnation, astral projection, aura viewing, crystal healing, etc. without really proving any of them.  There are some very interesting photographs of auras.  The author should've provided more of that type of information instead of going from one claim to the next without really proving the vast majority of them 
    The book had a very strong start. I will give no spoilers, but after Wyl Thirsk was given the Gift the book seemed to change. It was as almost as if this is where the editor jumped in and began to remove or shorten key issues. Explanations for bizarre events and happenings came quickly and easily, or were dismissed altogether. Villains would have a short chapter just before they were needed. They were often foul with a quirky inner dialog. Once used they would quickly be disposed of and a new set would arrive when needed without failure.     In one chapter the point of view switched from soldiers on a battlement, to the Queen, to a young boy walking through the gates. This happened with greater frequency the more Fiona told the story. It is the same reason that I started to read "Wayfarer Redemption" by Sara Douglass and had to put it down after a handful of pages.      As you may have read in some other reviews there is a dog in the book that has a special gift. After helping the Queen and a young boy he runs off only to show up at the time when Wyl needs him the most.  Wyl had just finished traveling by horseback for over a week when he received a blow of misfortune. The dog saved the day, was given a hearty "atta boy" and was sent back to help the Queen and young boy.     I read this one up until page 282. The straw that broke the camel's back was written on page 271. "He was soon luxuriating in fragranced, steaming water." Wyl, apparently, needed this respite.    I had hoped, in vain, the rest of the book would have been as good as the 1st quarter.  
 Mr. McDevitt's treatise on Tactical Medicine is just that - a treatise.  Although he covered many areas of tactical EMS, most were just touched upon and certainly not enough information was supplied to educate uneducated or to inform the active practitioner.  The book has no scientific references.  It appears to be purely anecdotal.  Any firm fact to be found there is interspersed with unfounded opinion.  To the uninformed, the difference between fact and opinion would be difficult to sort out, to say the least 
 This book raises ignorance to a level near sublime. It is wretchedly prejudiced against the Germans, blind to the suffering of the Russian soldiers, and maniacal in its insistence on digging out racial prejudice. I have read many works of history, and a good few on the Great War. This is an infamous performance and a shameful waste of one's time and money 
  The good thing about this movie is that it didn't last more than it did. Not that it's bad, no, it's a fine depressing movie. It may be very well acted -Duvall is great all right-, with nice songs perhaps, well directed if you like... But unless you feel identified with these characters -and I don't- there's no way you can enjoy watching this.   This is what I saw: All the characters here are self-centered individuals, conceited, self-pitying, deplorable and depressing. Duvall plays a drunk who quits drinking to start (perhaps) a new life. That he in the past was a sucessful country singer makes no difference to me, it just adds to his self-pity. I couldn't find anything positive in this story. Even the kids that show are aggravating with their persistent questions.   The picture we have here is that of a bunch of losers and dreamers. Everybody seems to blame someone else for his miseries. The children their parents, the wives their ex-husbands (& viceversa). Death, either thru war or car accidents, plays a major role too. It seems people have trouble getting over it, looking for someone to blame it on. Then the scenes in the church... I'm not sure what they are intended for. The three main characters (Duvall, Harper and the kid) go to church; him and the kid even get baptized, but they have no idea what church is all about; to them it's a social ritual (a tradition, a superstition?). This is not a movie about faith. It's about the troubles of these guys; the lady needs a man because she's young and lonely; the man needs... he needs to grow up; the kid needs a father and some homework. Nobody cares for others, only for themselves.  Honestly, the irony about this movie is that it's so realistic and its characters so phony. I understand why Duvall went immediately to make 'The Apostle', where he plays a role opposite to this one 
 I bought this book for my daughter, who has CP, like the girl in the story. I was hoping that it would be a story about living with CP and becoming independent. And, while it was those things, it also had some disturbing undertones... one of her friends (also with CP) lives in an institution and his mother visits him there once or twice a week when she isn't working... reading this through the eyes of my daughter I am horrified. That particular impossibility is something that hasn't ever ocurred to her; I don't need this book to plant it in her mind. Also, "being Sarah" sounds like being a girl stuck in a family with a cruel and unthinking father, an overworked mother, and fears about being institutionalized. This does NOT get a good rating, and I'm glad I read it first -- I will NOT let my daughter read it 
 If you're a fan of this series, do yourself a favor and re-read Life Its Own Self.  I started Rude Behavior for the third time and ground my way through because I was DETERMINED to see what had happened to Billy Clyde 'n them.  Now I want back the hours of my life I spent reading it.  It's at least 100 pages too long.  The idea for the plot is good, (Big Ed and Billy Clyde buy and manage an NFL expansion team) but between the wooden dialogue, the two-dimensional characters, the anti-PC fulminations that even I tired of, and the lines recycled from other novels, the finished product is awful.  The only thing that saves this review from getting one star are the occasional original Jenkins-ism, like what he has Jim Tom Pinch say to the Golden Domer out in Hollywood 
 .............I think he does a wonderful job at putting these works together.  The only bone I have a the moment is that Mr. Walsh tends to make all his victims heroes/saints/outstanding figures of society.  That cannot be true.  All victims are not saint-like. Conversely, the bad guys have no worthy trauma in their background. Cut and dried, bad is bad, no slack from Mr. Walsh.  I'm still thinking about that theory 
   Michael Moore filmed this propaganda,partially financed by the United Auto Workers, to distract attention from the real reason GM was forced to shutter plants - the Japanese auto invasion, made possible by  GM's unhealthy cost structure. The  company was burdened with exorbitant UAW wages, something union friendly Michael Moore does his best to conceal. So Roger Smith becomes the reason for the plant closings. Years of losses at GM have shown Moore's twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then - phoney  UAW sponsored lies to  shift attention away from the  primary role played by the UAW in the death spiral of the automakers. Moore and others pretend GM management had dropped the ball, but GM lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff, let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain. ALL of GM's problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the UAW albatross - slow redesign cycles, lack of money for research, you name it.  Moore will never mention how the UAW has screwed the consumers for the past 70 years and  how now that consumers have a choice, they find the better value in Asian autos. Nobody wants to pay a UAW worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor. The UAW has fixed labor prices for long enough. Enough is enough and Moore  is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a "documentary." 
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
 I purchased this product for my 3-year-old grandson on his birthday.  He played with it for about 15 minutes when we decided that it was a little old for him and we would wait a few months before letting him play with it again.  While in storage, both tracts that make the Excavator go forward and reverse broke.  Because of the time that passed, understandably, I had no recourse.  What a disappointment for a toy that had so much potential for fun.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS TOY UNLESS YOU HAVE $60.00 TO WASTE IN 15 MINUTES 
 It has good information, but if you are looking for an in-depth more complete book, this may not be the way to go.  
 Warning to all listeners!  This is not gospel hip hop.  I bought this CD and was very disappointed in the content.  KRS-1 is 5% Nation of Islam. At one point in the CD, he says that you don't need to read your Bible, you just need to look with your third eye.  Be cautious of what you listen to and what you buy, it affects your soul 
 Gene Hackman is Jedidiah Tucker Ward, an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good, enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere.  On the other side of this gap of good and evil is Maggie Ward, Jed's headstrong daughter.  Between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people.  The premise suggests the ending - Jed will win the day, but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney.  Jed will fight the good fight (which will require supreme grandstanding) while Maggie learns just how amoral her side really is.  What robs this courtroom thriller is what's missing in virtually every courtroom thriller - a case that could go either way, an actual case in controversy.  Maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture, Hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them.  Instead of a compelling case, we have one that's ready for our verdict as soon as we've seen the suits worn by either side or their offices.  The case in "Class Action" is one you can typify as "David & Goliath", which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power.  There's no way that we're going to see a case won (even by dishonest means) by Donald Moffat's hired band of Harvard-trained professional liars, and there's no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments.  Maggie's bosses are so transparently bad, that not only do they screw up, but even their explanations are patently evil  Even so, the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery, and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless.  For a thriller about high-paid lawyers, "Class Action" has all the legal acumen of high-school mock-trial, with fewer suprises 
 I can see the excitement, people get out of a gorefest but this is too much.  All taboos have been broken there is nothing left.  Johnny Cash should come back and torment the makers of this film for misusing one of Cash's songs. He would never have approved of this film. Letting a newborn baby be come a zombie is beyond bad taste. Johnny's horsemen should trample the makers of this film into grimy puddles of gore 
 Just about everything negative that can be said about this doll has been said here, but I still feel that I have to put my two cents in.  My daughter will be nine next month and, as always, she wants a Barbie doll for her birthday.  This is one doll that not only will my daughter NOT be getting, but one that she will never even see if I can help it.  Little girls love things that are shiny and sparkly and glitzy, but this doll goes way beyond that.  The doll looks like a [...].  The clothes and makeup just do not make sense in any other context.  Yes, it's just a doll, and it's the parent's responsibility--not the toy company's--to teach kids what is okay and what isn't.  But do you want your sweet little girl looking at this and imagining how pretty she will look one day in a crotch-length skirt?  
 My only conclusion about the popularity of D'Souza is that he writes what his audience loves to hear.  His opinions, and that is all they are, opinions with little concern for research, analysis, and refutation because they are so general, must strike a nerve in many 'young conservatives' who feel they are unappreciated.  However, that doesn't make his ideas right regardless of how much one wants them to be. That any author would presume to be able to make a comprehensive analysis of current political ideology in so short a book is rather insulting to people who spend their entire lives seeking the truth.  That this forum is in the form of a 'letter' is condescending to individuals who want to arrive at truth.  If one is inquisitive about how the world works, why read the pre-digested views of someone who immediately places himself in a one-up position with the reader?  Why not go out and learn about the world yourself?  Are people so afraid that their biases just might be unfounded?  If so, it does not say much for one's self confidence.   That said, here is a brief deconstruction of the sadly poorly reasoned perspective of the author, chapter by chapter.    1	Conservatives vs. Liberals:  Phony dichotomy, as if the country were divided into two mutually exclusive political camps. Enough said. 2	The Libertarian Temptation:  If you're considering what political agenda suits you, you use reason to arrive at conservativism.  Any other choice is emotional indulgence.  Not that Bush promulgates emotion (bring 'em on, for or against us, ad nauseum; or Cheney (yelled out. F__ Y___ at a Democratic senator during a photo shoot; Cheney the only Congressperson who voted against banning armor piercing bullets during a house vote proposing to ban said ordnance that went through police officers' bullet proof vests-Well, I guess one libertarian temptation doesn't count) 3	The Education of a Conservative--This sounds like you were born conservative and needed educating.  Is this a new variation of trait theory?  4	Pig Wrestling at Dartmouth--I guess every serious book needs a comic chapter title, but you're no Shakespeare.	  5	Fighting Political Correctness--You mean political correctness to which you are opposed.  Business suit, white shirt, red power tie, well-groomed: it's the photo of you on the cover! Suggested title "Fighting political correctness by being the correct form of political correctness."  6	Authentic vs. Bogus Multiculturalism--There's authentic and bogus everything: politicians, agendas, $20 bills, televangelists, etc. If you need someone to tell you what is the real thing and what is junk, you will always look to others for advice.  7	What's So Great About Great Books: Logic 101: define "tautology." Besides that, if you have to explain this to your readers, it doesn't say much about their own discernment.  No one should have to explain what is 'great.' Learn through experience.  8	How Reagan Outsmarted the Liberals: Drug dealers outsmart the police all the time.  Advertisers outsmart consumers.  So??? Is 'outsmart' a positive word?  Not to me.  9	Why Government Is the Problem: You're not talking about the morass of Iraq, sponsored by the Republican party, or the abysmal failure of the Bush FEMA program, or the indictments of top-level conservative politicians, are you?  Are fire departments the problem?  Is government--the entity that created the protection of free speech so people like D'souza could write books the enemy?  10	When the Rich Get Richer:  Another lame trickle-down economic theory; the trouble is two-fold: the rich don't buy things; they already have everything; they can invest their profits, but the big money is in investing overseas.   11	How Affirmative Action Hurts Blacks: THe old argument about class vs. race.  How about a new problem: "How outsourcing high tech jobs to India hurts Whites" Won't win too many conservatives with that one.  12	The Feminist Mistake: You mean there is only one??? I made at least three mistakes today alone! I bet if you ask him, D'Zousa would say he doesn't make any.  Everyone and every ideology makes mistakes.  We're all human.  13	Who Are the Postmodernists?  Corporations that rip-off 1920's car designs and haute couture and make a fortune are the only ones of import; the rest just sit around bee-esing.  14	Why Professors Are So Left-Wing: Since Business is the number one college major and the M.B.A. is the most sought after college degree, this argument is very old and lame.  Not too many Finance, Marketing, and Management professors are so called "Left Wing": whatever that means.  The 60's are over, dude.  15	All the News That Fits: Are you really going to rip-off a old joke that appeared in "Mad Magazine"?      16	A Living Constitution?  If the Constitution sat in a vault and no one knew it, would it be a constitution?  I suppose it's all how you interpret it; of course, those who are alive and who interpret it make it a living constitution.  If such people agree with your version, it's valid; otherwise, it's a chimera, I suppose.  17	More Guns, Less Crime: Households with guns have double the rate of suicide than those without guns.  Suicide is a crime.  I guess you weren't referring to THAT crime.  Yes guns don't kill people, Americans with guns kill people, at least in terms of so-called 'civilized societies.'  18	How to Harpoon a Liberal: Very revealing metaphor.  I guess when the whales are all extinct, you have to get out your aggression somewhere.  19	Lies My Teacher Taught Me:  Like the one that stated Teddy Roosevelt charged up San Juan Hill? Why didn't you mention that one?  20	Was Lincoln a Bad Guy?: John Wilkes Booth thought he was.  21	The Self-Esteem Hoax:  You gain self-esteem by hard work and accomplishment, like the ambitious young men who make fortunes dealing drugs.   22	Who Cares About the Snail Darter?  This is the tired argument about the expendability of endangered species for the sake of economics.  The U.S. has--I mean had--a long history of conserving nature.  It was part of our culture.  In the Philippines you can eat dog for a main course.  If you objected, some nice Filipino might ask "Who cares about dogs?" You do, because it's part of your culture.  Who's right?  Did you see the episode of Twilight Zone where beings came from another planet with a book "How to Serve Man," and it turned out to be a cookbook?  Be careful for what you wish for.  23	Against Gay Marriage: Look at Canada and the evil consequences it has caused there like low divorce rates, low levels of child molestation, low incidents of juvenile deliquency, etc.  Now check with the Moral U.S.A.  24	Family Values Since Oedipus: You left out your hero R. Reagan in this chapter: the only American president to have been divorced.   25	Speaking As a Former Fetus: I'd love to read Hitler's or Stalin's version of this.  26	The Hypocrisy of Anti-Globalists: If you can tell me where I can buy a DVD player made in the U.S.A., I'll run right out and buy one.   27	Are Immigrants to Blame?:  Sure they are to blame.  Just blame them.  They won't talk back.  They could get deported.  28	Why Liberals Hate America: Name three... Come on...You can do it.   I'm waiting....OK, get back to me later on that one.   29	A Republican Realignment?  You mean like the way they are lining up to protest stem cell research and praising the war in Iraq? Or maybe the way they're lining up to get fingerprinted with Delay in the lead and Libby right behind.  30 	Why Conservatives Should Be Cheerful: At least one conservative should be. You. If enough suckers buy your book, why wouldn't you be? 
 Reading this book is like listening to a speach by Bush.  His position is that "reasonable people" will agree with him, and those who don't either miss the point, are "unpatriotic" to his clearly righteous cause, or are just idiots.  If you are interested in this topic, read the summary of the book and the posted comments.  You'll get a good grounding in both sides of the issue - something that the book itself does not provide. 
 The title of this movie perfectly describes the acting.  Even The Little Giants had better actors than this, and those kids were only like 4 or 5 years old.  Ok, so they were probably 12...that's not the point.  Second String tries to use those inspiring lines that all football movies have (you know, the ones meant to give you goose bumps), but they don't succeed at all.  In fact, they fail with flying colors.  When I first saw this movie, I decided that I'd rather be the sunblock boy at a senior citizen's nude beach than watch it again.  Needless to say, I haven't seen it since 
      From his previous books covering the Salem witch trials, one would assume that Peter Charles Hoffer would know a witch hunt when he saw one.  Alas, he fails.  With respect to Michael Bellesiles' tome Arming America, Hoffer allows himself to be seduced by the dark side of politics.  Bellesiles was a former professor at Emory University who resigned after an embarrassing investigation, but one which failed to find the evidence critics complained showed he falsified data in his book.  Hoffer offers nothing new in his own work.  Rather, he rehashes and embellishes the molehill of evidence against Bellesiles which relied heavily upon right wing innuendo and disreputable scholarship.  It would have behooved Hoffer to examine more deeply Bellesiles' evidence for his theses.  Hoffer instead channels his efforts in characterizing Bellesiles' behavior much in the same way a jilted fiance might describe a former lover.  Hoffer says he did not even bother to contact Bellesiles for the book.  This is a telling omission.  Even those condemned by the Salem witch trials were first allowed to speak in their defense 
 I'm very disappointed with this book.  It touches on some concepts that could be useful but there is absolutely nothing in this book a PHP programmer can put to use right away.  I've built several web sites using PHP/MySQL and there is not one single thing in this book useful to me.  The book is mainly a survey of concepts, NOT an advanced programming guide.  Nothing in this book is fleshed out completely enough to actually begin using it in programming your website.   If you want to actually use any of the ideas in the book, you will have to find a better source of information and documentation for the particular idea or technology.  For example, the book has a decent introduction to the Smarty template system but not enough info to actually start using it effectively.  There are no performance or feature comparisons between Smarty and other template systems so I'm not even sure how you're supposed to decide if Smarty is right for you (the author merely mentions that Smarty is popular, not why you should or should not use Smarty).  Another example: the book talks about three different load generators and gives examples of their use (about 1.5 pages each) but definitely not enough details to begin using any of them.  The only thing of value I got from this book is a conceptual understanding of reverse proxies.  Of course, if you actually want to implement a reverse proxy yourself, you're going to need a lot more information than you'll find in this book.  I gave this book two stars instead of one because it is a halfway decent survey.  The title, however, is totally inappropriate.  It has nothing to do with advanced PHP programming.  Instead, the title should be, "Shallow Survey of Concepts and Tools Related to PHP and Web Development" 
      As a classroom teacher of all levels (honors, gifted, and Advanced Placement Language and Literature courses during the past thirty three years, I feel this book was a disappointment. Its title belies its contents. There was nothing new and inspirational for students that do not at least introduce an innovative new concept. I have been ordering from Amazon and keeping abreast with classroom texts for more than twenty years. I wasted my funds on this one 
 This book was first published in 1981, but later edited and republished with a new title in 1984.  The author was clearly influenced to change the direction of this book from the first printing because of his contact with YWAM, John Dawson, Richard Twiss, Daniel Kikawa and others who are hawking these same ideas.  Any good Christian anthropologist will tell you that history shows that, though most Gentile cultures had some sort of "supreme being" they worshipped, those "supreme beings" were one god among a pantheon of gods.  The Bible is clear that "from the creation of the world" all Gentile cultures had corrupted the knowledge of the true God.  Though the first printing of this book had some good ideas about cross-cultural methods to preach the Gospel to many cultures, the additions to this book prove clearly that it is unbiblical in its basic premise.  The new title "Eternity In Their Hearts: Startling Evidence of Belief in the One True God in Hundreds of Cultures Throughout the World" is an unbiblical statement.  Why do I say that?  Two verses end Richardson's unbiblical speculations:  Eph. 2:11-13  Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles by birth and called "uncircumcised" by those who call themselves "the circumcision" (that done in the body by the hands of  men)-remember that at that time you were separate from Christ, excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise, without hope and without God in the world. But now inChrist Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ. Rom. 10:14-15  How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news! 
 A this book is a horrendous confusion of second hand opinion on reading rate.  As with good learning ability, the more strategies and accurate knowledge you have about reading, the better you will become.  However, this book twists pseudoscience and misleads the reader at almost every turn.  The term reading, involves at least 5 seperate rates which have different goals (Memorising, learning, Rauding(normal reading rate for good comprehension), skimming, and scanning).  The author uses only the word "reading" to account for all of them.  He claims that you can read at a breakneck speed with full comprehension.  However, even an inexperienced reader would class that as skimming, and reasonably expect a severely reduced comprehension level.  Reading research (and common sense) will back this up.  Skimming is useful at sometimes, when comprehension is not important.  However, the author seems to be encouraging the blanket application of skimming, thereby training possibly the worst kind of reading habit possible:  Single track ignorance.  The exercises and tests given are not reading comprehension tests.  They are a combibation of skimming and general knowledge tests.  A very cheap confidence trick.  Find a good book on reading skills, and some good books you like reading. Victo 
 I found this to be a collection of superficial soundbites. If a person is a fan of the major players they might enjoy seeing the interplay between them but for me this documentary is a bore 
 When I first learned about this book I was so excited.  I had just started gripping on feature films and I thought I would be able to pick up some tips.  Sadly, while Mr. Uva has been Key Gripping for years, he fails to  provide true insight.   While this book is great for people who have never  worked with film equipment, at 30 clams, I regret the purchase. If you have  gripped before, I would pass on this one 
 I felt this book did not give enough information about the subjects they were to have special sections for.  It gave just enough information on each subject to get many beginers in trouble.  I bought the book for the special section on shearing.  There was one paragraph and a referance page to see a picture the was not even on that page. This book was deffinatly a disapointment 
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 This book was so boring I couldn't finish it. It appears to be an effort to fulfill a contract obligation. It has a very thin plot and it repeats trivial things ad nauseum just to fill the pages 
 This is a poorly written book. It abounds with errors, and the notation is horribly inconsistent. In my opinion you would be better off using a combination of Griffiths, Sakurai, and Shankar. Abers was the text required for my quantum mechanics class, and I used it as little as was necessary 
 This book is a poisonous but convincingly well written attack on divorce.  It's conclusions --- that divorce pretty much always destroys the children --- kept me in a bad marriage many years longer than necessary, and it's conclusions are flawed.  First of all, this is a very small study of people who volunteered to be included, so the families under consideration are far from representative of the population as a whole. (The participants were offered free counseling, so you could argue that Dr. Wallerstein was selecting for the least functional divorces.) Moreover, there's no control group, so it's unclear which of the problems that Wallerstein discusses are actually caused by the divorce and which or are commonplace in society as a whole. (Other studies point to the latter.) She simply assumes that everything bad was caused by the divorce.  This book, however, is an effective indictment of the too-common arrangement, where the mother gets the kids and the father is banished to a four-day-a-month visiting schedule---an arrangement that's almost guaranteed to be bad for the kids. Most of the divorces she discusses work that way. There are other alternatives, however, that are much less destructive, and Wallerstein's book discusses none of these.  I strongly recommend that you read Mavis Heatherington's "For Better or For Worse: Divorce Reconsidered" and Constance Ahrons' "The Good Divorce: Keeping Your Family Together When Your Marriage Comes Apart," either instead of, or at least as a complement to Wallerstein's book. These books are based on much larger studies, done properly in the sense of looking at a large, randomly selected, group of subjects with control groups in place. They come to very different conclusions than Wallerstein 
 I had high hopes for this book based on the subject matter. The book was nothing like I expected. It reads like a 10 year old's term paper. If that is the target audience then the book is a success. However if you graduated from grade school then you will probably be disappointe 
 The Quiller Memorandum takes place back during the cold war. It represented a time and place in history that was true at that time. It accurately depicts an era that is now gone, that some of us lived through.  The movie, by today's standards, is a little disjointed and incomplete.It jumps to a conclusion but lacks story development how it got there. Some scenes must have been edited on the cutting room floor back in the 60's or 70's in order to get a G or GP rating. As a result of those incomplete or cut scenes, part of the movie makes no sense.  The movie would have been better served if it were produced closer to the author's original book.  The most memorable part of the movie is the haunting score, including Matt Monroe's "Wednesday's Child".  I was disappointed in viewing this movie again some 20 or 30 years later. Perhaps Wolfe was right when he said that we can never go home again. Quiller must have gotten lost on his way home!  
 This album has 3 hits. Movin, Changin, L-O-V-E you. The rest is fluff. Im sorry I bought it. 
 This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo 
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
 The use of this AC power adaptor has increased the amount of static to the point where using the radio with the adaptor is pointless. On battery the radio works very well, just attach the adaptor and all reception is lost.  Invest in batteries rather than this product. 
 I was very careful to not press down as instructed when cleaning CDs, yet I was left with light circular scratches and smudges untouched.  As for scratches, you may as well use toothpaste for all the good this will do you. The solution does not fill in even the lightest scratches. I tried it with several different scatches and discs and the result was the same. Multiple applications fared no better.  The disc I bought this for primarily is in worse shape than when I started 
 No one dies, as they do in most Steele novels, but "Klone" is entertaining anyhow.  Recommend as an audio listen, not as a read 
 I really thought, when I bought this LP, that this would be an improvement.  There is a keyboard mix on the first cut, but then Farner recycles one of his boring, repetitive guitar breaks and the record takes an artistic skid from there.  I notice the CD has a live version of "I'm Your Captain."  This is one of the band's better tunes, having been played ad nauseum on your favorite album rock station.  But the instrumentation is stretched out sans improvisation and it all gets tired.  That a new generation even thinks this band is worth anything must be a sad commentary on the state of modern rock and pop music.  Footnote:  The LP jacket was ROUND and shaped like a huge coin.  I'ts corny, but far catchier than the insipid music found inside 
 now I'm all for relaxing, warm music.  there are times when I need music that is deceptively simple or even straightforwardly simple.  and unchallenging.  you know, it's the morning after, and you have to do paperwork.     but with the exception of possibly 1 or 2 songs, this is pretty much just a bore.  barely pleasant wallpaper.  but it's the barely pleasant which makes you nauseous after looking at it for more than a minute.     if you want quality pastoral post rock or chamber rock or whatever, check out Nudge, the Necks (the album Sex is an amazing starting point), or Town and Country.  
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 I'm a 32DD, and while this bra does virtually eliminate bounce, I could get the same results with duct tape. Unflattering shape, uniboob (with the accompanying "interesting sweat" problems) and overpriced. 
 I've tried very hard with this album since its release, but have to disagree with most of the reviewers here. The incredible string band, pentangle, Bread, love and dreams comparisons are, in my opion, wishful thinking. This isn't due to Espers ability as song writers, but to their incessant use of annoying overdriven heavy metal type guitar everywhere. This ruins what is otherwise a nice album 
 This is in response to reviewer Natasha Lofft's claims that she is the half-sister of Natalie Wood in the review of Gavin Lambert's "Natalie Wood: A Life," dated on May 23, 2005.    Natasha Lofft is the daughter of Maria Gurdin's first love, Captain George Zapalov and his wife Nina.  This story originated from a fantasy that Maria Gurdin, Natalie Wood's mother, harbored for years because Captain Zapalov was her first love.  Maria Gurdin first met Natasha Lofft while vacationing on the Russian River when Ms. Lofft was a teenager.  Maria Gurdin, it must be noted, was a woman who suffered mental illness and Alzheimer's for many years before she passed away.  George Zapalov had blue eyes and Maria Gurdin had green eyes.  The two of them together could not have had a brown eyed child.  Also, Nina, Natasha Lofft's real mother, had brown eyes.  How could Maria have given birth to two kids around the same time?  If Natasha Lofft wants to prove that she is truly Natalie Wood's half-sister, she should pay for a DNA test and stop wasting people's time with this fantasy 
 It's hard not to like Doreen Virtue and all she talks about. She talks of many uplifting things. But then she downplays the role of Christ in the world. He is put at the status level of Ghandi and Buddha! Christians understand that this is a great falsehood.   So even though some good comes of following Doreen, her Source is not Christian angels and Christ. If you keep reading her stuff you'll be getting help from fairies, unicorns and angels instead of God himself. You decide if that's who you want to set your faith in.  As I said I like the woman and enjoyed her books I read, but after much soul searching I realized I was subtlely being brainwashed into putting my faith in the wrong things. So I must give the book one star because it's the only option available 
 I watched as much as I could stand on PBS before concluding this was not a classic 19th century novel unknown to me but a poor recent imitation, and came online to verify that.  Anyone who is enjoying watching this has presumably never seen anything based on a really good novel, like those by Dickens, Dumas, or even Wilkie Collins. What ****!  I refuse to waste my time even to see it through to the end.  This is only for people in the current generation raised to observe frequent violence rather than intelligent plot and conversation.  It is not terrible, but not worth watching if you have anything at all worth doinng with your time 
 For any number of reasons I can probably say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. I understand that a lot of people think this is genius. I am not one of them. Personally, I don't find endless descriptions of sex with minority boys to be very entertaining reading, let alone genius. I also don't find pointless prose that appears to have no discernable thread of thought to have much value. Personally, I like to read good story tellers, authors like Tom Robbins or Salman Rushdie. Naked Lunch is about as opposed to them as you can reasonably get.  This is one of those books that sounds a lot better when someone translates it for you. In reading the preface where Norman Mailer talks about it in the context of the court proceedings in the 1960s, the book sounds interesting and culturally pertinent. However, upon reading it the book falls far short of the lofty status we get from Mailer's answers on the stand. I understand how Alan Ginsberg, a proclaimed NAMBLA member, would find it's material suitable. I wonder about Mailer though. While I'll never take a stand against a person's writing what they want, I do take pause when someone recommends something like this.  This is not literature so much as a heroin clouded view of the author's own serious problems and his interpretation of our culture's deficiencies. The notion that this is the "naked" truth, or lunch as it is so called, is so absurd that the book should never have been accepted as remotely resembling cult literature, in the past, present, or future. Who reads this and resonates with it? Who thinks, "Yes, gay sex with boys is what my mind is all about? Oh, and all the better that they're Arabs!" Very few people, the author included. Burroughs himself admits this was difficult to write. This is probably due to the fact that the vignettes portrayed here do not, in fact, represent anything so much as the anarchy resplendent in the author's own mind while he struggled with various addictions. As a case study in heroin and morphine addiction, this may have some merit. As a counterculture commentary on society I find it worthless.  This isn't about my sensibilities being assaulted - far from it. If I can read & enjoy Robbins's linguistic forays into sex with nuns, I can handle just about anything. I'm not offended with flying sperm so much as I am insulted that anyone felt this was worth reading; that I was lured into thinking this was a work of art. It's not.   Sometimes I read books that don't suit me, but I understand why someone would like it. This book falls squarely in the camp where people feel they need to proclaim it genius because they're so confused or intimidated by it. This book is far from genius. The author admits it was put together from scraps of things written while he was in his heavy heroin addiction, and that he vaguely remembers much of it. I don't see how, or in what context, this book will appeal to anyone other than a case study of a certain segment of people at a certain instance in time in America 
 This is the first book by Shaara I have read. And, if his other works are like this, it is also the last.    On the cover, J. Persico is quoted as saying Shaara makes "literature read like history and history read like literature."  He goes on to claim that Shaara brings the war to "pulsating life."  I have even read a review that claimed this book was better than Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front.    I must have been reading a different book.  The first chapter, The Replacement, is a great short story.  After reading it, I had hight expectations for the book.  Unfortunately, it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view.  And, the history reads like an 8th grade textbook.   His narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived.  They are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them.    After the dislocated short story of the first chapter, the book delves into a long-winded story of the flying aces, interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story.  It frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book.  Shaara doesn't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918's, when the Americans arrive, focusing, as I noted before, primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war. I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own.  Here, however, it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story. Or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the British or French perspective.   And, I have no particularly problem with him focusing on the American perspective on the war, but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry?  I suppose a smaller book doesn't sell as well.  For those interested in historical fiction, I would recommend Bernard Cornwall's work.  And, perhaps, Shaara can learn a bit from him 
 One of the Spotlight Reviewers says that by combining two great characters--Sunny Randall and Jesse Stone--Robert B. Parker has doubled our fun.  Quite the reverse.  He has cut it in half.  The characterizations of Sunny and Jesse are enormously feeble; and the the rest of the characters are no great shakes, either.  Sunny's Irish Mafia uncle is a cardboard cutout.  Suitcase Simpson has three funny lines and is heard from no more.  The villains--Buddy, Erin, Missy, Gerard, Moon--are little more than vague names and stereotyping.  Spike is relegated to a scene and a half.  Oddly, the only interesting character is a very minor one: Eddie.  But he only stays around for 10 minutes  Even the plot is tissue-thin.  The love-story is lame; the sex-scenes boring.  Worst of all, who should appear but (Christ!) Susan Silverman, from the Spenser series: one of the dampest and most wooden and least interesting characters in fiction.  As with "Cold Service" and some others, Parker is just coasting with this one.  He is capable of far better.  
 First you get to marry a doctor, then you get bored and become a Bohemian, find some drawbacks there and so finally you get to marry somebody that understands and appreciates you.  You get to take care of and understand animals as a veterinarian.  But your life still seems to miss some spark and so a murder mystery is thrown into the mix.  All of your friends are affiliated with Harvard, Berkeley, or some other high prestige place--no Illinois State or blue color workers for you.  This was a truly awful book written for dreamy status-seekers with no empathy or understanding of the real world 
 Buy one of the other versions with special features. This is the older, first-generation DVD with NO features. Nothing. Plus, this is a flipper disc!  A great movie worth owning.. just not this edition 
 The book covers the process of smoking well. Good information on brining, sausage making, and processing smoked foods is provided. It lacks fundamental data such as internal temperatures of smoke cook meats. A few  recipes are presented, but this is not a cookbook 
 It's said that the second historian was the first revisionist.  In other words, to some extent any and every telling of history reveals as much about the historian as it does the history.  But for as much as the telling of history is always interpretive, it is also entirely possible for an historian to confront, recognize, and largely neutralize her own interpretive biases; while she need not abandon or apologize for her point of view, nevertheless it is her responsibility to present all the relevant historical facts -- especially those that might cast doubt upon her interpretations and agendas -- and then argue her case with all of the relevant information on the table.  That is the difference between interpretive history and deceptive or misleading polemic.  Lepore accomplishes only polemic here, then, in that she presents as supporting evidence for her biases only her own highly questionable interpretations of the semantics of the colonists' own writings on King Philip's War.  She is hermeneutically daft, asserting a self-contained truth within those writings that is simply absurd.  Texts (especially in the case of the very personal diary entries, private letters, and firsthand accounts that constitute the overwhelming majority of the colonists' writings on King Phillip's War) do not and cannot contain some absolute, inescapable meaning that imposes itself upon the reader.  Texts communicate their real meaning only when referred to the indigenous contexts (social, political, religious, philosophical, linguistic, psychological, etc.) that produced them; when removed from those contexts and read in ignorance of them, the reader must of necessity substitute the contexts and agendas of her own experience for the authentic contexts, so that the texts will appear to have radically different meanings than they really do -- they will seem to mean whatever the interpreter wants them to mean.    And what does Lepore want the Puritans' writings to mean?  What is her agenda here?  Essentially, it is portray the Puritan colonists of 17th century Massachusetts as despicable hypocrites.  Now, as I said, if that's her agenda and her bias, that's fine; but it is acceptable for her to present the conclusions born of that agenda and bias as history only on the condition that they are argued in light of all the evidence that might call them into question.  Lepore fails on this count.  Again, she confines the supporting evidence she provides for her theses to her own highly speculative interpretations of the colonists' writings; as other reviewers have noted here, then, this book is much closer to deconstructionist literary criticism than it is to history.  She misses the forest for the trees: she makes no attempt to check her interpretive biases against the broader historical narrative that is the context of King Phillip's War.  For example, in 1622 the natives around the Jamestown settlements in Virginia attempted to eradicate the presence of the colonists, through a surprise act of genocide that followed eight years of peaceful coexistence.  The attack ultimately resulted in the deaths of two-thirds of the roughly 1200 colonists in Virginia at the time, and sent a powerful shock through the other New World colonies and their groups of sponsors across the Atlantic.  The natives committed their genocide at Jamestown only two years after the Plymouth colony was founded; it is unquestionable, then, that from the earliest years onward the Massachusetts colonists' attitudes toward their native neighbors would have been colored (and rightly so) by a great deal of suspicion and mistrust in light of the knowledge of what the Virginia natives had done to the Jamestown settlers -- only fifty years before King Phillip attempted essentially the same thing.  Yet Lepore never once mentions the genocide in Virginia, and does not recognize its immense significance for the relations of the English and the natives in Massachusetts fifty years later.  To name another example, Lepore offers no analysis whatsoever of the nature of the Puritan faith of the Massachusetts colonists, and how that faith affected their conduct in the war.  She does mention their faith in a non-specific way, when it serves to imply a monstrous hypocrisy on the part of the colonists; but never is an astute or sympathetic understanding of their religion presented, and since the early Massachusetts colonies were communities of an almost monastic fervor, devotion, and asceticism, Lepore simply ignores an immensely important factor in their motives and reasoning during King Phillip's War.  In its place, she asserts that the colonists fought to preserve their "Englishness;" in support of this idea, she presents some diary entries and editorials of the day in which the colonists wrote of their fear of becoming like the savages, should their common life in the New World continue in the direction they thought it was headed.  But it seems perfectly clear to me that Lepore has grossly misinterpreted those writings.  The colonists did not actually think that their assimilation into the native culture and way of life was real possibility: the warning that they might "become like the savages" was not a cultural apprehension of theirs, but rather the sort of hyperbole so often used in Christian homilies and catechisms and pastoral essays intended to exhort the faithful.  The Massachusetts Puritans were not afraid of becoming Indians.  They were afraid of losing their faith, losing the Christian path through life that they had sacrificed so much to preserve.  They were afraid of any compromise or waning of the Christian zeal and austerity of their near-monastic lives.  After all, it was in order to preserve the Christian life that they had left England in the first place, decades earlier: they had first settled in Holland after the English anathematized them, and then left for the New World when they saw their faith diluted by worldly comforts and distractions while living on the Continent.  So to me, the idea that they fought the natives in King Phillip's War to defend their "Englishness" is simply preposterous.  Englishness was something they had willingly left behind to purse their religion, and played no more of a role in most of their lives and motives than that of superficial, sentimental cultural orientation.  I think it's deceptive for Lepore even to pose the question, "why were the English really fighting?" as though it requires some subtle expert analysis: the colonists fought the natives because the natives were trying to kill them... it's as simple as that.   There are many more examples of Lepore's highly selective consideration of the historical record, and highly questionable reasoning and interpretation.  But it is not possible to argue them satisfactorily in a review such as this, of course: to respond adequately I would have to write a book of my own (as I've already made a good beginning of doing), taking Lepore point by point.  One thing I'll grant her is that she presents her source material openly, with no attempt to conceal certain passages that might be interpreted any number of other ways than those she has chosen.  But again, the biases and misunderstanding that a 21st century American will inevitably bring to any reading of texts produced by 17th century Puritans render any approach to understand their conduct of King Phillip's War solely by a consideration of those documents a myopic, naïve, misguided effort, and doomed to failure 
 Man this game sucks.  I LOVE SNL, but the questions here are SO trivial.  I was looking forward to getting this for Christmas and was very excited when I opened it.  It all went downhill from there.  I think the pieces are a good idea, but they're ugly.  The DVD clues are dumb and ineffective.  I was playing with my dad (who is legally blind).  He couldn't read the questions on the tv.  I think it would have been better if the dvd was narrated.  Overall, the game sucked, the questions were silly and it wasn't fun at all!  As an aside, I noticed that there are no African Americans on the box or the board.  One could argue that Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock were more successful SNL stars than, say, Cheri Oteri.  Whatever.  Game sucks.  Costs too much.  Stay away 
   This book is filthy.  I had to take a shower after I read it.  Why doesn't he get a job?  Why does he have to live in France? Why doesn't he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers?  So many questions.  People just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say James Michenier because it was banned.  It was banned because it's a bad book 
 As a molecular and cellular biology major, I've taken my fair share of biology courses and know a good deal about the workings of the body and its cells/organs. The ways in which mitosis, nerves, etc. are described in this book are decent, but there's no argument as to HOW or WHY any superior force possibly would have created such a body. The author plays the chicken-and-egg game with too many topics and ultimately lumps himself with the Intelligent Design crowd. This book may serve as a biology primer for some, but there's no proof and very little discussion on God. Considering that the title and his previous books' titles mention God, why would this book have almost no discussion on God? The layout of the chapters is as follows: 20 pages of biological explanation, followed by a few paragraphs that ask questions about God or origins or something similar - but the questions make little sense and go unanswered. I went into this book with an open mind and was floored by his superficiality. Save your money and time 
 I would strongly discourge using this book to try and learn mass transfer. We used this book in Purdue's mass transfer course and the classmates I spoke with agreed -- this book was extremely confusing and took a "hand wave" approach when solving the difficult mathematics.  A much better book is Transport Phenomena by Bird, Stewart, and Lightfoot 
 Wow 5 blades instead of three? Who would have thought of that? I smell noble price here!  Don't let the great cosmetic design fool you. It turned out to be the same thing but with more blades.  I was really excited waiting for my brand new Fusion Power razor to arrive, I am allergic to shaving so this was a big issue for me. After the first shave my hopes were destroyed. It turned out to be about the same thing. They even mentioned the blades being closer as an improvement, when in fact, I think they were forced to do it that way because if not they would have ended up with a huge cartridge that would not fit the contours of the face.  The only obvious new feature is the trimmer, which is only that, a feature, and not a real technical advance. I hope that someday these companies start to invest a part of the income they get from the overpriced cartridges in research and development, instead of investing it in marketing. By the way, my power handle came broken, so I couldn't test this feature, although I have had power handles in the past with other blades and the difference was minimal. What will be next, let me guess, 7 blades? I guess that these guys should really start working in something new because the "adding more blades" thing is getting exhausted.  
 This propaganda is by a guy who tried to impeach Clinton while he himself had an affair. On top of that, Gingrich tried to PASS A BILL THAT WOULD GIVE THE DEATH PENALTY TO POT SMOKERS (people who brought 40 grams of weed with them over the border - talk about crazy). This guy shouldn't be in politics - he should be in a Siberian Labor Camp. He, like all Christian Fundamentalists, should just take his bible and his 'lord baby jesus' and shove it deep up his a**, because the rest of the country really doesn't want to hear the bells of theocracy anymore. Do we really want to put our nation in the hands of this antiquated nihilistic Jesus myth? I think not.  Again, this isn't the 'United States of Lord Baby Jesus,' and we as a nation should do everything in our power to prevent it from becoming so.   It's also important to realize that OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WERE NOT CHRISTIAN. They were deists which is akin to today's agnosticism.   George Washington's practice of Christianity was limited and superficial because he was not himself a Christian... He repeatedly declined the church's sacraments. Never did he take communion, and when his wife, Martha, did, he waited for her outside the sanctuary... Even on his deathbed, Washington asked for no ritual, uttered no prayer to Christ, and expressed no wish to be attended by His representative.  HERE ARE SOME OF THE MANY ANTI-RELIGIOUS QUOTES BY OUR FOUNDING FATHERS:  JOHN ADAMS - "This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it." - "The divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity. Nowhere in the Gospels do we find a precept for Creeds, Confessions, Oaths, Doctrines, and whole cartloads of other foolish trumpery that we find in Christianity."   THOMAS JEFFERSON - "I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology." - "Christianity neither is, nor ever was, a part of the Common Law."  BENJAMIN FRANKLIN - "Lighthouses are more helpful than churches."  - "The way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason." - "I looked around for God's judgments, but saw no signs of them."  - "In the affairs of the world, men are saved, not by faith, but by the lack of it."  THOMAS PAINE - "I do not believe in the creed professed by the Jewish Church, by the Roman Church, by the Greek Church, by the Turkish Church, by the Protestant Church, nor by any Church that I know of. My own mind is my own Church. Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all." - "All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian or Turkish, appear to me no other than human inventions, set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit."  - "The study of theology, as it stands in the Christian churches, is the study of nothing; it is founded on nothing; it rests on no principles; it proceeds by no authority; it has no data; it can demonstrate nothing; and it admits of no conclusion."  Save yourself the money and do the research yourself.   THE PROPER ROLE OF A GOVERNMENT IS TO REMAIN AGNOSTIC.  AND REMEMBER, OUR FOUNDING FATHERS DID NOT BELIEVE IN JESUS. 
 Dr Weil is a quack and making a lot of money off some very misleading information.  If you want to waste your money, you can buy this book.  It makes non-evidenced based medical claims as if they were fact and plays on  the readers ignorance and desire for a simple cure-all.  I work in the  medical field and am always shocked by the amount of misinformation that is  published.  Save your money and don't buy this book

 "Anticipation" and "Legend in Your Own Time" are the best songs here, and they are both included on her "Best of" collection. This album isn't horrible, but it probably sounded a lot better  back when everyone was smoking pot 
 Honestly, i think this album's not half as good as MOT.  as a matter of fact, it's worse than their 1990 release, 'step in the arena'.  it's just an okay album 
 I first heard Julieta on a compilation CD called "Exoticas: World Music Divas." I loved "Como Sé?" so much that I purchased "Aquí." At the time, I wrote (on amazon's page for that CD) that she was, hands down, the best female rock/pop singer in the world, regardless of language. I was excited to get her second release "Bueninvento." CMJ New Music Monthly even had an article about her. Her best question was at the end, in which she asked not to be compared to Britney Spears.   I was very excited about her next release when I heard "Lo Que Venga Después," from the film "Maria Llena Eres de Gracia." Brilliant.   Now we come to this one. Dear, oh dear. What the hell happened? If there were ever a Latina equivalent to the Liz Phair blantant sell out model, we have it right here. It pains me to say this because the woman is very talented. Now she's on stage performing with some guy, and, yes, Paulina Rubio, in a video I have seen on VHUno. If you want to blow all of your credibility for an increase in sales, releasing a cheese CD and appearing with pop stars is the way to do it.    What's next for her? How about teen pop magazine covershoots with a smily face and a bunny, maybe some surgery and having a hip hop star make a guest appearance on the next CD? Gotta have lots of meetings with the hair stylist, the personal trainer, and the wardrobe consultant, because that what "artists" who focus only on image do. No time for music, ya know. The Britney Spears comparisons of insipid, vapid, bubble gum pop may begin.  I can only hope she'll return to her senses. If not, maybe Molotov can write a not-so-flattering song about her.. 
 In a table of cable types early in the book, he lists cat 3 but not cat 5.  Otherwise, has a surprising amount of useful information, presented in a sometimes disorganized way 
 Not sure what is in this stuff but it turns my fairly healthy hair into the texture of straw.  Even my own sylist said, whatever you are using...STOP..you hair feels very damaged.  It goes back to normal texture if I use my other shampoos.  I made sure to use it on and off to be sure it was the Jonathan shampoo..and it was.  It went into the trash.  Don't purchase this stuff...unless you're going for the scarecrow look 
 Why do I dislike Emma Thompson so much as an actress? Aha, I know why -- she can't act. She can read lines and make gestures, but never makes me believe for a second that she's who she's pretending to be. She ruins everything she touches. I have to admit I couldn't watch this in its entirety, purely because of her. For those who haven't seen the show, just look at her picture on the box; she looks like a woman wearing a hat that belongs somewhere, anywhere, else. It's like a pimple on cheese. Apart from her, it was OK, but I don't like Branagh either, another actor afflicted with an unhealthy dose of self-consciousness in his acting, which is fatal 
 I read this book, excited to hear someone talking about how pyschology can be used to study more than just dysfunction.  However, as other reviewers have poited out, the author repeats himself unecessarily throughout the book.  He also uses anecdotal evidence almost exclusively--which means most of his conclusions or platitudes with little impact.  The book Authentic Happines by Martin Seligman is a much better place to turn if you're interested in positive psychology 
 I Purchased the Winter Solstice Vol #3 thinking that it would be as good as the rest,was I disappointed. Tracks 5,6,7,10,11.13 are atrocious,the rest of the tracks are good.I cant get to my CD player fast enough to skip over them when they start playing.I now sample every song on the CDs and dont take for granted that all Winter Solstices are created equal.People,please start giving honest reviews and stop the false advertisement 
 The author of this book should have never received his degree. The book is very confusing and vaguely describes any mathematical process in arriving to its conclusions. An example of this is in chapter two where the author attempts to describe call blocking but ignores any input traffic to the system. The author obtains values from thin air and does not describe how the process used in obtaining the answers. This type of confusing gibberish is seen through out the book. I strongly recommend that you do not buy this book 
 Awful. The keyboards don't release songs from their locks of excessive emphasis in obnoxious "JUMPDAFUP!!1" breakdowns and formulaic structures. Ok, it's more about attitude than anything. That would be fine, but I have a hard time relating to the emo...tional, straight-edge lyrics. Suffice to say it's an impossibility. Eh, yeah. This is a decent record within the confines of its bloated, suffocated genre, (Which still isn't even worth a listen) but far from the most important album of the year. - Thus says the Pellingto 
 Porgy and Bess was originally staged as musical theater, with a tough schedule; and concessions were made to preserve the perfomers' voices.  The concessions, (cuts mostly) kept it completely unpretentious.  And of course it was under Gershwin's supervision.  I find it much more satisfying than the more "grandly operatic" versions; and Todd Duncan is unequaled.  The finale when Porgy sets out in his goat cart to find Bess is a heartbreaker, unequaled by any other version.     Sound is better than the badly remastered MCA CD of the early 80's (?).   EDIT: I used mouse wheel without reclicking, and rolled the stars choice down. IT SHOULD BE FIVE STARS.  
 This is a very good book on the subject of Oedipus, but not quite the best book on Sophocles or Oedipus. I  liked both Bates' "Sophocles-poet and dramatist" and Weinstock's "Sophokles" a wee bit better, but  that may be just my personal taste. Knox has a very bad habit of insisting  that, by playing with the translations of tense and the shifting of  meaning, and the redistributing of stress in a given sentence, that whole  new meanings of the text can be 'discovered'. This is a very lazy,  haphazard way to engage in critiquing, for it is not research. And Fagle's  translation is plodding. Takes the poetry right out of the text 
 Did not purchase.....there was no look inside to see if it was what I was looking fo 
 Don't waste your money!!  Your kids can do a better job than he did 
 I had to read this book for class.  It wasn't that good.  Conversations get confusing because its not clear who is saying what.  It might be a small book but its tedious reading.  I'm usually a fast reader but it took me a couple of days just to get through 3 chapters.  I asked around at class and found that I was not the only one who had this problem.  Its less painful if you just get a summary or if you just get someone to tell you what happens

 I've always been a casual fan of the Talking Heads. I liked their music, but only had a few of their CD's, so I decided to treat myself to this set which I thought would be comprehensive. Well, upon receiving this mess of a "box  set" I was so taken aback that it took me a while to get to the music.  The "box" is actually a rectangular book with fairly bizarre and unappealing art. (Nudes that represent... what?) The book itself, because of its shape, does not lend itself to easy reading, and while the contents are of a decent quality, some artist appreciations by the likes of Rick Moody and commentary by the band members,some intersting curios, like notes and original lyric sheets, and a discography, trying to read this while hoping the binding holds up while the pages flop all over the place is quite a feat.  The music itself is a decent overview of the band's work. The three CD's have a nice cross section of the band's work, but for the cost and the annoying packaging, I would have been much better off with SAND IN THE VASELINE 
 Quick confession before I really begin: I have not read the entire book. I actually have about ten pages to go before it is finished, but I'm sure the very ending of the book will be just like the rest of it; bland.  This book is like reading a screenplay for a movie, only a typical screenplay at least gives you an idea of the emotions of the characters. I bought this book hoping for a sort of inside into the mind of Batman, of Rachel or even Alfred. This book delivered nothing.  Whole chunks of dialoged go by where the characters are just simply speaking. There was no, "Bruce winced" or "Rachel's eyes turned stony and her next words were cut sharp..." It was just plain dialoged. The reader was left to fill in the gaps with what the characters were doing, what they looked like while talking in the movie because the author filled us with none of it.  The whole impression I got was that the author was given a screen play and told to write a novel off of it and was not allowed to delve into the characters minds. With the exception of Alfred saving Bruce from the house fire or the journal entries of the main bad guy we are given zero insight into how these characters think, how they move, why they do what they do, or even what they look like.  Take the Scarecrow. I thought the character was intriguing. He had makeup around his eyes in the movie making him seem almost pretty. Some of the shots clearly pointed to this in the film. It was made obvious and I wondered why the actor wished to portray him that way. In the book? Nothing. Just, "Jonathan Crane unfolded his long legs and stretched out." or something. In the entire book, that is what you are given to picture one of the main bad guys.   You have to have watched the movie to get any idea about what the characters are about, and their motives because this book provides none of it. I don't even know why Alfred decided to help Bruce on his quest to develop and become Batman. Well, I do get an idea from it from the movie but from the book... he just does it.   Even Alfred's snarky comments fall far short of funny because there is no comedic pause. There's just a list of dialoged. There is no writing telling the reader what the reactions of the other characters are to even tell you it was a joke.   So here is my summery. If it is floating around somewhere, get the screenplay if you are that interested in the movie. Either this author was too afraid to develop the characters or simply was not allowed to do so. Or better yet, watch the movie again. You will find more depth and less eyestrain in that film then you will in this book. 
 Terrible and boring! He leaves info out that was later all addressed and dismissed in court. He tries to report after only six months on the case.An opportunist 
 if you ever meet someone who you have heard is a fan of this book, stick a pin in their arm to see if they are alive 
 After reading the book, I found McBride to be very one-sided. He advocated the black man throughout the book and failed to mention even once that white policemen aren't anti-black, they're just anti-illegal, as in the case of the LA riots he brought up.  However, I have to pick a bone with the essay on Abercrombie & Fitch. As a long time employee of A&F, I have seen just as many blacks and asians work for the A&F label as whites. McBride says that the way the models and persona of A&F come off through the hair styles and clothing fashions makes it a company that deters black people from shopping or working at Abercrombie. This is not the case. Obviously, McBride has great bias. He assumes that just because black people are black, they won't wear high-priced, more-on-the-preppy-side clothes. There are black men and women who ARE Abercrombie models and ARE regularly featured on their website and in their quarterly magazine. And so what if Abercrombie is a more "preppy white kid" brand and less black people shop their? What about FUBU, Sean John, Roca Wear, and other such black-oriented clothing lines? I don't see anyone writing a book saying "the image that FUBU is displaying deters whites from shopping there." White people simply get criticized for not assimilating black people, yet all other demographics are appluaded when they work against white people. After reading this book, I say McBride is full of garbage. Go spend your money on something better- like clothes or a cup of cofee 
 I am shocked at the number of readers who have given this such high marks. This is really a piece of ****. That plot is paper-thin, the characters are shallow, stereotypical losers, and the book if full of that isn't-writing-a-gay-novel-such-a-lark attitude.  I mean, I don't expect everything to be great literature and I enjoy fluff as much as the next person, but the preliferation of this type of novel scares me.  By "this type" I mean bad imitations of already fluffy fiction. Anyone who has ever watched a bad sitcom and soap opera could write a book just like this.  Please notice:  I did not say that writing ability was required 
 They allowed me to try one issue before I paid for the subscription.  After I read the first issue, I decided to cancel.  There are a couple of good topics but the articles were poorly written, for example, you couldn't see clearly what the conclusions or recommendations are.  The rest of the magazines are all advertisements, which you can get for free from the internet (or just anywhere) 
 There is NO EXCUSE for this book to still be in print. "Reengineering" was a trite meaningless buzzword of the early nineties, that when adopted by hack middle managers incapable of thinking anything through, or imagining unexpected results, cost tens of thousands of people their jobs. The authors of this book have already issued their mea culpa for getting so much, so wrong, in the Wall Street Journal. Management fads come and go. Your job is to figure out if the hot new book sweeping through management circles has any merit, or if it's garbage.  I am horrified that this book is even available. If ever there was a book that deserved zero stars, this is it. Stop paying these two moron authors for their incompetent advice.  Collins Busines ESSSENTIALS? Give me a break 
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 If you are looking for a good John Deere toy tractor, this is not it.  If you are looking for a nice green toy tractor, this may do.  The stickers on this model will peel off on their own within an hour of adhering them to the tractor.  Manufacturer says to ship back to place purchased and ask for refund, but no parts are available even if you have missing parts.  I have spoken with others that own the same toy and same thing happened to their stickers too.  So if you buy it, don't waste your time placing the stickers on it 
 I had these for a year - 6 months of the time I was overseas and did not use them. When I got to wear them the  "socking' pulled out of the left boot and the velcro flaps came away from the leather leaving me to glue them. I contacted the dealer who was rude and not interested in my boots, me or the fact the things had a problem. They did not answer my e-mails either. Stay away from this rubbish and a complascent company 
 This is not a complete book, and that was not clear.  It is missing Books 4 and 6 and the appendices (about half of the original 1920 text) 
 The first book in the series, City of Ember, is brilliant.  The second book, People of Sparks, is still interesting, although it does not live up to its full potential.  The Prophet of Yonwood, a prequel to City of Ember, is completely dull.  It takes so long to get to the point (the point being how Ember becomes Ember and exactly what has happened, etc.) that I rushed through all the pages to find that there are only 2 pages at the very end to connect the plot in Yonwood to Ember.  It's so disappointing because I was earnestly hoping that all the details and mysteries that are just hinted in the City of Ember would be unraveled in Yonwood 
 I've read all of Iris Johansen's novels and thoroughly enjoyed many of them--this, however was not one of them.  I found the plot hard to follow with too many references to her previous book.  What mysterious event happened to Jock and Royd?  Who is MacDuff--well if you haven't read the previous novel, you'll never know 
 That is what this book deserves, a big fat zero. This stuff was treated in much greater depth by business thought leaders several years ago. Notions of inter-enterprise process engineering, powered by the Internet, were rigorously documented several years ago. This professor turned management prophet must have spent his millions derived from his previous book of "stories" --circa 1993-- and needed a new source of funds as the world went far past him and his business process rengineering (BPR) stories, long ago. This guy writes stories, not first principles upon which companies can act. Ever tried to "implement" a story? Save your money --buy Tapscott, Fingar, Weil or Hagel books on the subject 
 This novel was a terrible disappointment for me because I have enjoyed almost all of Elizabeth Berg's previous novels.  This one, however, is so unrealistic, so phony and so easy to see where the story is leading.  An idyllic marriage, a perfect little town, ideal new neighbors and acquaintances,  friends who rush to the aid of the new widow even though she has ignored them for 30 years, and so on.  Too treacly by far! 
 I like reading.  I am a literature snob.  I put down poorly written novels (even though I can't write well myself!).  But, I think I've met my match in this novel.  I recognize the style is something unique, but I just couldn't grasp the rhythm.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those who gave this book thumbs down.  I really want to be in the group that appreciates this Plitzer Prize novel, but I don't make the cut.        HOwever, I'd love to read more from reviewers on what they saw in this book because I just couldn't find much other than the rambling thoughts of a very whiny and boring 40-something man whom I would't enjoy spending a 3-day-weekend with at all.        I've persistantly struggled through 180 pages, but now will surrender!   
 Hi, First of all, I love this band , and think it is one of the hardest working Rock Band. I bought it last month here in Brazil. The DVD was oficialy released here in Brazil as a 3 disc NTSC edition. The first thing a noticed is that there are two concert discs, one for 5.1 and the other for stereo. It's strange, i do not know why they did this way. Two disc for sound options only?? Strange!! I do not understand how the sound could be so bad. I think a lot of money was spent to make this DVD, but the sound is thin, with no BASS, and no punch. The 2 chanel version is a litle better. The Edit - It is very hard to watch the entire show with this fast editing. The edit is too fast, much faster than the Rock in Rio DVD. I just could not watch this show, IHO. They should re-edit the video, and re-mix the audio, and give it free to people who bought it. The Rock in Rio is a much better DVD. T Buy it instead.  Antonio Souz 
 Disappointing to say the least.  Over 90% of the writing in this book was in book one - The Prodigal Son.  I find it hard to believe Koontz can release this in good conscience.  There are perhaps an additional 20-30 pages of new material in this book.  Save your money and go straight to book 3 
 Camera worked great for us for 6 months. Easy to use, decent pictures and good software. The battery life was fine for our use. It quit working at six months and would no longer focus and is now useless. For a six month disposable camera its a little expensive. 
 I tried with two sets of new batteries, the goggle unit flashed but no massaging action whatsoever happened.  Besides that, the design looks cheap and it feels very tight and uncomfortable to wear.  Avoid this item 
 This book has been compaired to "The DiVinci Code" by Dan Brown. Yes, they are similar - neither author is a good writer! Oy, where do I begin? There are SO many mistakes I couldn't belive it. For one thing, Loomis is in LOVE with the word, "which" - which got very tedious. I am still amazed at the disappearing dog. At one point the hero (totally cardboard and unbelievable) is attacked in his appartment. The dog growls to let our hero know the bad guy is going to break in. A vicious fight starts and...not a peep from the dog! Where was he? Hiding in the closet? I have three dogs and believe me if someone so much as put his hand on me, he had teethmarks. I gave up on this mess about a third of the way through 
 Sounds up to date, and I bought it thinking it new, but tired forecasts from 1990 can easily be beaten by anyone of average thinking from the vantagepoint of 2000. Avoid and think for yourself instead 
 Driver's Ed is about some teenagers that steal a stop sign and someone dies in a car crash as a result. The teens are guilt-ridden and ask of each other whether or not to confess.  This book was very hard to get into. What little action there was was at the end of the book. There were many unneeded characters at the beginning, too. I really didn't enjoy reading about someone's guilt trip because they did something stupid like steal a sign. If this book was written to teach a lesson, it was one I already learned, so I didn't need to read this.  I wouldn't recommend this book. If you're looking for a suspensful book about peer pressure and teens doing morally incorrect things, I would suggest Breaking Point by Alex Flinn over this book 
 I purchased the Live from Dublin CD and much to my dismay my computer tells me the CD is corrupted. If go through some trouble you can propably get the thing to play on your computer but will probable not be allowed to listen to it on an mp3 player  I am required to install spyware on my computer?   I gave up and am returning the album. I am sure the music is great but it is a bit to restictive for me. They cannot trust me but I must trust them to access the music and then on only some of my players? Sincerely Jim Meeha 
 Many years ago I enjoyed reading Ivins' columns but unforunately her brand of independent liberalism has turned into just another mainstream media voice parroting the Democrats. Her personal hatred of George Bush has become distracting and embarrasing. Strangely enough she reminds me of Rush Limbaugh. When he began doing political commentary on the radio Limbaugh was an independent with a conservative streak and was comfortable attacking Republicans. Similarly Ivins was originally an independent with a liberal streak who was comfortable attacking Democrats. Now Limbaugh is as firmly ensconced in the Republican camp as Ivins is in the Democratic camp.  What a shame 
  There are just too many errors ,of interpretation,omission and commission,in this book to justify purchasing it.In this review we will concentrate on Rima's(R)handling of the work of J M Keynes.On p.84,R's claim that the Physiocratic concept of hoarding is "surprisingly suggestive" of J M Keynes's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.On p.133,R claims that Malthus had developed a principle of effective demand,a la Keynes.What Malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and/or intuition that Ricardo's deductive,analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking(or assuming away)the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending.Nowhere does Malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to Ricardo.What Malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with Ricardo.In chapter 20 of R's book, she attempts to deal with Keynes's theory of effective demand and Keynes's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory.Keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20,titled "The Employment Function".R should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book,replacing her chapter 20 with Keynes's chapter 20.R's Figure 20.1,discussed on pages451-454,directly contradicts Keynes's analysis 
 I purchased this as a book on CD and it was horribly dull.  I kept waiting for something "meaty" but the characters were completely flat.  The voices on the Audio book were horrible and the Marilyn Monroe voice of the car was completely far fetched.  It never came together as a book and I was so glad when it was over.  This was the first Janet Evanovich book I read(listened to) and I am not willing to waste more of my time with future novels 
 Only "Atchison, Topeka and the Santa Fe" survives....  Judy overplays and the only thing worth mentioning besides the titlesegment is Virginia O`Brien...   To me - this film doesn`t exist in my collection of Judy Garland items.. 
 Color is such an important element in Mr. Scharf's work that it's difficult to believe this monograph was published without it.  There is not a single color photograph aside from the cover.  And the book is so tiny [Dimensions (in inches): 0.26 x 7.85 x 5.28]  that color photographs wouldn't do Mr. Scharf's work justice anyway.  I recommend that interested parties try to find a copy of one of his out-of-print books at their local library.  Mr. Scharf's work is amazing, and well worth viewing in full color, as he intended it to be viewed 
 I was expecting to finally get a real insight into the business nightmare that was Apple and its role in the destruction of the Beatles when they had to become exactly what they said they hated: businessmen. Instead, I get a lot of sloppy investigative work that's almost all based on hearsay by people who weren't the meeting rooms they're reporting about and other very well-known quotes used by the authors like they were given to them directly (which they weren't). It's unofrtunate because a book on this topic needs to get written. This is not it. Also, it was clearly thrown together in great haste after the collapse of the Beatles and the editor in charge was out sick the week the galleys were delivered 
 I bought this book based on the recommendations here; unfortunately I have to say it's been a disappointment, and I feel compelled to write my own review too. While the book is obviously well researched and rich in details, the author interferes too much in the narrative -- I am frankly not very interested in Nicholas Thomas' personal relationship with Cook and Australian history. He claims in the introduction that he wants to stay away from the hero and anti-hero biases, but the whole book is very judgmental of Cook and his crew. In trying to be politically correct in 21st-century terms, the author fails to capture the 18th-century spirit of the voyages. Indeed, he paints a dark, boring picture of Cook that doesn't coincide with the exciting contemporary reception the navigator had in the second half of the 18th century. The style is poor, with long, convoluted sentences that take re-reading to decypher. Most annoyingly, there are several typos of foreign words, which I find unacceptable for a book published by a major publisher -- it shows a lack of attention to detail. I wish I could recommend another Cook biography, but I simply don't know. I can, however, highly praise Diana Preston's newly published biography of William Dampier, _A Pirate of Exquisite Mind_ for those interested in European navigators 
 I bought this book sight unseen, and ended up very disappointed. The fact I actually agree with Galbraith only makes this more maddening.  Most of the points he makes challenge conventional wisdom, but are not particularly original in themselves, and his pompous yet abstruse writing style makes reading a painful slog. I have never seen such abuse of the passive tense and periphrases, Strunk and White must be spinning wildly in their graves.  This is a very slender volume, essentially the content of an op-ed column padded to fit an essay. The price the publisher is asking for this slim folio (it hardly qualifies as a book) is perhaps the real fraud here 
 For those of you who think this book is depressing, try Susan Allen Toth's travel books about England.  They are charming 
 I have read every Leaphorn/Chee book by Hillerman more than once and am a great fan. I just finished this book and discussed it with a friend.. we both agreed it was so disappointing.. we cannot believe it was written by the same person. The writing was awkward and heavy-handed... by the second page I suspected something was wrong here. It reads like some cheap Harlequin mystery/romance. The sensitive handling of Navajo spiritual beliefs, the beautiful rendering of the landscape, the terse but meaningful conversations are all missing.  All I can say is, the publishers need to pay more attention to future manuscripts and insure that a writer of Tony Hillerman's caliber is not allowed to decline in the public eye... he has given us much enjoyment.... he deserves better.  And if someone else is fleshing out Hillerman's plot lines.. the public should be warned 
 Micah was a pale contender to previous Anita books- There was very little action...outside of the bedroom anyway.. I like a little heat..but the plots from the first few books are what I became obsessed with. I couldn't put the books down...the Micah installment, I felt, was rushed..with little to no plot, or action. No evil to overcome. Just disappointing.  I was weary of even reading the books after some of the reviews I have read. And although I have started liking Micah, and accepted that Anita and Richard won't work out..this book was a letdown 
 Do yourself a favor and skip this one.  Nothing happens, the killer is zero-percent exciting.  Overall a very lame read 
 It tells me 'no device to download to'.  Amazon, debug your product before you take people's money!! You are acting like Microsoft.  There is no way to report this to Amazon. Does anybody there care anymore? 
 Lucy Cousins has a great idea with "Maisy Goes Swimming" but did 'undies' have to be included? But as gross as the book was, the illusrations were quite good, so I gave it another star. Let's just hope  that the subject of undergarments are not mentioned in future books. Thank  you 
 I have to admit, that I was suprised to see that this book got such a high rating, as it was the one in the series that pushed me away from Xanth.  I finished it and was overcome by a sense of pointlessness in reading these books that must have begun with "Demons Don't Dream."  The older books are much better, when the author actually had a story to tell, it seems unfortunate that now Anthony spends his time with Xanth in attempts to fill it with what he thinks are clever puns to appease the fans who send in their ideas, when really in my opinion, the puns are just plain annoying.  I suggest Anthony stops cranking out Xanth books so quickly, and instead tries to think of some interesting stories to tell, although I have to say, there are signs of improvment with the most recent books, "Faun and Games," for example 
 I was so ready to love this book.  As a teacher with predominantly Mexican-American students, I am very concerned about their success and I hoped to learn and understand.  Instead, I was exposed to shoddy research and theory.  Valenzuela's agenda was so upfront throughout all her research and analysis that she never paused to consider other explanations.  In the words of Non Sequitur comics of late, she is a "preconceptual scientist."  She makes sweeping generalizations and accusations which are not supported in her data.  She leads her informants' answers, she jumps on the anti-school bandwagon, and she doesn't do her background research - such as developing theory of caring.    I like the premise, which is why I was so very disappointed at the extremely weak scholarship that this book represents.  Her heart is in the right place, and it's where my heart is, too - but that is never an excuse for such sloppy research and theory.    
 A very thorough and easy read for beginners to start thinking what lies beyond the computing technology. This book may be similar with Gate's The Road Ahead, but does not intrigue much ecological vision into abstracting  the craft 
 Did not like this album at all.  Poorly written and musically a failure.  No wonder this guy trashes other artists 
 This book was written in 1921.  Read by my grandmother, mother, and now myself.  My Grandmother gave me her copy. My mother always said how she would have loved having a lunch box with compartments like Elnora's.  My grandparents were pioneers in Southern Alberta and times were tough and money sparce. School was not free and it was hard work getting there.  This book shows us how to focus on what is important and what it takes to get there. Though Elnora is fictional, there were thousands of young women trying to get educated in that time period. Thank you Gene for a beautifully written story of triumph and love 
 I only give it 2 stars for the shower scene with the Twins. Really bad acting and plot that makes little sense. Trying to be like the original movie but falls way short. Its just bad acting with stupid and mean characters. Not worth it except for the brief shower scene. 
 I found this book to be weird quiet frankly. Chapter 2 goes off the deep-end of designing efficient queries before you've even built a report yet. That material should have been put at the end of the book. Creating a report with the report wizard is covered in Chapter 4 but probably would have been best if it was before Chapter 3 which covers creating a report manually. I didn't find anything "Pro", as the name implies, or advanced with the book. It's a broad introductory text only. Also, it only covers using the ReportViewer control for Win Forms and not the one Web Forms. The two are similar enough but coverage of both would have been better. 
 Gene Hawkins has a longstanding desire for committing suicide.  That is very unlikely for a Dick Francis hero.  Indeed, Hawkins is a typical Francis hero; a man of a strong will, an indomitable spirit and a detached mind, yet he bears a wish for killing himself.  That's too odd.  The story is not bad as a mystery, but I can't tolerate such inconsistency in the hero's character 
 This garbage is one of the most hypocritical bands i have ever heard in my life. if you only knew... conservitive [...] and ironically enough they never did anything in music before or after knapsack. they surfaced once but their courage was confused. the secrets in the sacrifice 
 I have dry, fine, easlily tangled color-treated hair and thought this sounded like the answer. I was surprised to read the other comments since, for me, this just plain didn't work. My hair was as dry and frazzled as before I used it. I have better luck with conditioners that don't have to be left on for nearly as long a time. I recently discovered a great conditioner from my hairdresser called Bonacure which works in a few minutes and leaves my hair in great condition, shiny, managable and detangled. And for a mask I tried Keratase and it was fantastic and the consistancy made it easier to use and my hair was silky smooth and stronger. I really thought this would be amazing for any type of damaged hair but it wasn't the right choice for me. Maybe I would have had more luck with Fekkai's glossers 
 Get's one star in appreciation of the technicians who had to record the cd. What a mess! Never should have been made. Even Julie is way past the point of playing this onstage. She half talks her way through her songs, her voice clearly not what it was when she made the film. Sorry Julie, should have left it alone.  The rest of the cast is not on a par with the film. Tony Roberts in place of Robert Preston...not on his best day. Leslie Ann Warren was riotuosly original in the film, Rachel York trying to copy her, is not. And Michael Nouri? Dismal. The songs added to the score for the stage.......forget it. Not even worth mentioning any more. Goes into the WHAT WERE THEY THINKING? file. As for Julie refusing her Tony nomination because the rest of the show was overlooked? C'mon Julie, there was a reason for that, the show SUCKED! 
 It is extemely difficult to select stories from five of the greatest SF writers (add Clarke and Asimov and you have the top seven) of the 20th century to give the whole volume a negative, downbeat tone, but Fred Pohl has managed it.  If you like your stories upbeat and hopeful for the human race (in the editorial fashion of John Campbell) this book is a definite "save your money."  I have been reading these authors since the 1950s, and I can't imagine a worse set of choices 
 I found this movie to be almost unwatchable.  If your idea of a good time is watching Henry Gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes, then this movie is for you.  The three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it.  Altman can pull off such greats as "Mash" and  "Godsford Park" and then stink up the joint with this.  What's up with that 
 I'm still trying to read this one.  It's got just enough story that I want to find out what happens, but there's so much boring detail to drag through that it's taking forever.  I try reading a paragraph, but then get distracted by a speck of dust on my desk that's tremendously more interesting than reading yet another two-page description of yet another crater.  Which, boringly enough, is exactly like the last crater, except this one's a little bit bigger.  Or maybe it's smaller.  Or has a different mineral composition.  I'm really not sure, as I'm learning to skip ahead as soon as anyone drives into or flies over a crater.  If the science part of sci-fi appeals to you more than the fiction part (far, far more), this is a great book.  But if you like the fiction aspect better, or even just want a balance, you're probably best just skipping this one 
 Believe me, I dearly wanted this pan to work out. It costs well over $100. However, no matter what I did, everything I cooked in this pan stuck. I tried using it without greasing it, greasing it with oil, spraying pam on it, putting ghee/butter in it etc. The following things all stuck: pancakes, eggs, hamburgers and chicken. In fact, every thing I tried, stuck. Also, the shape was strange as most of the surface area was off the heating surface. Also, they have this 1" label on the bottom that was hard to get off. I finally did but once I cooked something, when I turned the pan over there was a microscopic film of glue from the label that I wasn't able to get off and it had turned brown. Ugggh, this was the worst cooking experience of my life. Needless to say, I returned this pan...  
 I'm not a mathematcian!  The book teaches Calc in a way that makes mathematicians (like my professor) very aware that they know WAY more Calculus than their students (who have never taken it before).  The examples in the reading section are quick and simple, and the problems are longer and more complicated.  If you are a math major aspiring to write complicated algorithms, you should love this book.  If you're like most of the people in Calc who are taking it because its a required part of your major, it's really not very helpful.  P.S. I did get an A in Calc, but still dont like the boo 
 For the price this is not a bad keyboard.  Here are the two major problems I have with it:  1) The feel is nothing like a real piano.  The keys are springy and you have to apply a fair amount of pressure to hold a note.  2) The instructions have a big sticker on them, stating that this keyboard is made of materials known to cause cancer and/or birth defects (including lead) and to "wash your hands after handling".  How on earth did this manufacturer decide to use such materials with a device that is intended to be handled a lot, very possibly by children?  It's going back...  
 Expounds some sort of "new age" mathematics where clarity, accuracy and consistency are evidently unwelcome.  Perhaps this was intended to make the result non-threatening, but it is neither beautiful nor useful.  It will go down in history -- with luck, leaving not a trace 
 Amazon.com should immediately cease selling this book.  It was published without Hawking's permission and is a blatant effort to ripoff Stephen Hawking!!    Go to his website, http://www.hawking.org.uk/info/iindex.html, and you will see the following admonishment:  "IMPORTANT NOTE It has come to our attention that the book "The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe" has been published. Professor Hawking would like to make it clear that he has not endorsed this book. The text was written by him many years ago, however the material has already been published in books such as 'A Brief History of Time'. A complaint was made to the Federal Trade Commission in the US in the hope that they would prevent the publication. We would urge you not to purchase this book in the belief that Professor Hawking was involved in its creation. 
 I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a "Wim" in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are "The Gift" and "Safe Harbour".  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try 
 I have to say that even though Teti Hatcher's performance was good the movie itself was terrible. The plot was pretty dumb and the situations that take place in the movie are not believable. I can;t believe I wasted my money on this one 
 "Tourists are learning that the image of the terrible Turk is false, created to a great degree by it unfriendly neighbors. Turks are quick to remind visitors that, surrounded by Syria, Iraq, Iran, Armenia, Georgia, Bulgaria, and Greece, they're not living in Mr. Rogers' neighborhood."  This is a direct quote.  It sounds like they're trying to say that the surrounding countries are painting an incorrect negative image of Turkey. Which is amusing, since he listed both Greece and Armenia there, which were both targeted by Turkey. Either this writing staff has no idea what they're writing and is just happy to sell books, thinking no one will double check the info, or they're Racist and opinionated. Either way, I wouldn't trust the info in here even as a rough guide on where to go. 
 Talk to the Polish and South Koreans, and ask them why they do more with less.   
 "Le Morte d'Arthur" or "The Death of Arthur" is an exceptionaly long and boring book no one should ever have to read 
 Reads like a dictionary, each page is nothing more than bullet points that alternate between definitions and corollaries.  Proofs are typically very short: explained and illustrated in no more than a quarter of a page.  More appropriate as a reference manual than a textbook for a class 
 No offence,but I couldn't agree more with most everyone else who's rated this collection.It just isn't right without Sons Of The Desert,Way Out West,The Music Box and Another Fine Mess.For me the best films in this DVD set would be March Of The Wooden Soldiers,Be Big and The Lucky Dog.The latter being a collector's item going by how it was Stan and Ollie's very first film together,even before they became the famous comedy duo.Utopia would be another collector's item,being their very last film from 1950.I hadn't realised they were around that long.However,their appearance in this film is an eyesore,with Stan so thin and sick looking and Ollie three hundred pounds overweight.One thing you may notice,is the film's remarkable simularity to Gilligan's Island 
 So not at all what i was expecting. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused.  
 [http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/Genesis.asp] [www.answersingenesis.org] has numerous refutations of 'progressive creationism' and specifically of Ross' assertation of the meaning of the Hebrew word for day (yom). They clearly demonstrate the grammatical errors of his claim.  Also see the book "Refuting Compromise" by Jonathan Sarfati, Ph.D 
 This book is useless, it doesn't even come bound, it's just a bunch of sheets w/ holes in them so you can place this in a binder.  The book isn't great because it is far from an atlas.  It is more like a lab manual, explaining a little about the different lab tests.  It basically has only one picture(in color)for different examples of each bacterium.  Seeing as how it's an atlas, I assumed it to have lots of different pictures of each bacterium.  Furthermore, it occupies alot of space with useless low yield info such as chemical structures.  If you're buying this book for pictures of bacterium and virus, don't, because you can find comparable pictures on the internet.  Also, not sure about this, but it doesn't seem that the authors are PhD's or MD's.  They don't list a designation after their name, which may not matter to you, but I've found that most of the useful books are written by PhD's/MD's.  SUmmary: Low Yield Book; Should not include atlas in the title because it is far from one. 
 I have never been a fan of Danielle Steel's books and have only read a couple in my lifetime, and those many years ago.  I'm not sure what motivated me to pick up Toxic Bachelors -- extreme boredom? insanity? -- but I slogged through it last night and have to say that it confirmed all my bad impressions of this writer's work.  Actually, I think I was a little surprised by how awesomely bad it was.  The writing was completely repetitive and superficial, and I rather felt that I was reading a treatment for a novel rather than the novel itself.  It read like a poor book report:  "...and then he did this, and then he did this, and after that he did this, and then he laughed."  We are TOLD that the bachelors -- who struck me as commitment-phobic, a little neurotic, and fairly immature despite their (middle) age, but not necessarily toxic -- are decent, likable guys, but we never really see too much proof of that.  When the "proof" does come, it's so ham-handed as to be laughable:  Charlie's eyes well up with tears when he meets a young girl who was abused by her mother, and so we know that he truly does have a loving and compassionate soul and untold complexities to his character.  Yeahsurerightwhatever.  Most of the story is told through narration, with little bits and pieces of ho-hum dialogue.  The author adopted a third-person point of view, but there's certainly nothing omniscient about it, and the reader is never sucked into the head of one of these characters.  Throughout the book they remain about as interesting and dimensional as paper dolls, and their interactions with one another always struck me as being fairly unbelievable.  THIS is how men behave and relate to one another?  I find that hard to believe, considering that none of the men I know run around telling each other how much they love one another and how important they are to each other.    I liked the female characters of the book initially.  They all seemed to be strong, capable, independent and emotionally healthy women.  But my opinion of each diminished greatly toward the end of the book, as each woman seemed all too willing to disregard her personal boundaries and put up with extreme schmuckiness from her man.  And the conflicts Steel generated amongst the couples seemed ridiculous:  mountains out of molehills.  For instance, Gray, the 50-year-old artist who has always been phobic about family, refuses to meet the ADULT children of the woman he's been with for several months and whom he claims to love.  Nevermind the fact that he's known about the ADULT children since the very beginning.  Nevermind the fact that the ADULT children live in England and Italy, while Gray and Sylvia are New Yorkers.  Nevermind the fact that they have their own lives and are independent, self-sufficient ADULTS who maintain their relationship with their mother through frequent phone calls and less frequent face-to-face visits.  Evidently Gray can't see beyond the fact that they are "kids" and therefore "family" and therefore not to be tolerated.  Sorry, but whatever sympathy I'd developed for Gray by this point disappeared altogether when confronted by this monstrous display of immaturity.  Dump the weenie, Sylvia.  You can do better.  The other two guys had similar displays of gross ridiculousness, and of course everything was wrapped up magically, with sudden capitulation, as if the men had just suddenly come to their senses.    Considering what little time and effort was spent on these characters, their conflicts and resolution, I have to wonder why Steel even bothered writing this book.  And why I bothered reading i 
 I am ex US Army, National Guard and Army Reserve.  I did not expect to receive dress web belts made in China and Taiwan from an Army Navy store.  I have other belts made in USA that are heavier materials (belt and buckle).  The belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new!  I ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking I would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life.  The web material is very thin for a belt.  The buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in Taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in China.  They are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing.  I will not recommend this product to anybody.  After shipping this junk cost me $47.00 !   
 I read all 12 of these things. Armageddon has it's moments but as with most of this series is sorely lacking. Nicolae and Leon are pretty lame as the incarnation of evil.. Nicolae acts more like a spoiled 11 yr old with the world's arsenal then the antichrist.  And Leon (was a buffoon and lacky) rather then "the False Prophet")   People either love or hate this series.. I for one do buy into the Dogma the series teaches. It is much different then the theology and spiritual beliefs I hold dear. 
 its the reason why i am considering never ordering books from amazon again! i hate not being able to flip thru the book before buying it. had i had a chance to do it with this one, i would have NEVER bought it! it is one word - dumb. aimed at primarily sales organizations. and it reminds me of, dunno, knife salesmen and multilevel marketing events where everyone goes "yeah!!" like they're about to win a war in one decisive battle and not sell cleaning products! it is useless for an agency person, and it has very very limited use for corporate marketing people. i don't know WHO this book is written for. maybe for people who have never had exposure to anything even remotely resembling marketing. the writing style is patronizing, and at times irrelevant. it pisses me off that paid 16 bucks plus 35% s&h on top for this piece of [...].  and what is even more disappointing is that the reviewers before me gave it all those stars.  goes to show how much one can truly trust readers' reviews. oooh, disappointing is such a weak word. 
 There are several discrepancies in this book, starting with the title.  The top job is an air traffic controller, making approx. $120K a year.  Here's the problem:  To become an air traffic controller, a person must enroll in an FAA-approved education program and pass a pre-employment test that measures his or her ability to learn the controller's duties. Exceptions are air traffic controllers with prior experience and military veterans. The pre-employment test is currently offered only to students in the FAA Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative Program or the Minneapolis Community & Technical College, Air Traffic Control Training Program. The test is administered by computer and takes about 8 hours to complete. To take the test, an applicant must apply under an open advertisement for air traffic control positions and be chosen to take the examination. When there are many more applicants than available positions, applicants are selected to take the test through random selection. In addition to the pre-employment test, applicants must have 3 years of full-time work experience, have completed a full 4 years of college, or a combination of both. In combining education and experience, 1 year of undergraduate study--30 semester or 45 quarter hours--is equivalent to 9 months of work experience. Certain kinds of aviation experience also may be substituted for these requirements. That to me says I need a degree!  Several other jobs listed in the book are also "mis-informing".  
 I was excited to buy this toy for my 16 month old daughter intill I was programming dora.  While programing the doll it would not take in her name or any other name that was not on the list 
 This book was a huge disappointment....I had to struggle to finish it...we read it for Book Club and thought it was dreadful. The climax of the book is in the first couple of chapters, very little character development....The story is boring and cold... I would not recommend this book... 
 I saw it on TV and LOVE that movie. I was so thrilled to get DVD to watch it again BUT the negative thing is there is NO CLOSED CAPTIONED or SUBTITLE for Deaf, Hearing Impaire and Hard of Hearing people. Its too sad. It isnt worth it to buy it. 
 i could only read half an hour of this. ive read over a dozen guides in this vien. dont waste your money 
 After reading this I came to realize that I just wasted an hour of my life.  It's constant bickering by the two main characters who can't seem to do anything right.  There's no point to this nonsense and it gets more annoying as you continue.  I found myself saying, when will it just end!?  What a piece of trash.  Do yourself a favor, read the script or watch the movie - do not pick up this graphic novel 
 I get it.  Sometimes it's hard, impossible, to break away from the dictums of society.  That doesn't stop this movie from being one of a handful of movies that make me wish film had never been invented 
 I had a hard time getting into this one. I almost gave up on it a couple of times within the first 100 pages. I did get more involved at that point, but I never was able to stay invested in the story line for any significant amount of time. Just when I was starting to enjoy a section, the author would lose me again. It could be that I am just not all that interested in ancient Egypt. Perhaps if I were, I might have cared more about these characters. Not bad, just not great 
 I'm sorry, but this album is by NO MEANS a classic. Just because it has NWA stamped across the cover does not make it good. Just because it is the early origins of NWA does not make it good. If you are a diehard NWA fan it's worth owning, but I'm not gonna tell people "You have to own this, it's so good". Because it's not. Let me show you how this review should really go 1.Boyz N Tha Hood-Early version, worth owning if you want to hear the first version of it 2.8 Ball-Another early version. Also the "clean" version, aka sucky version. Honestly, did anyone favor NWA songs without all the four letter words? 3.Dunk the Funk-Fila Fresh Crew is a horrible band. I can see why the DOC left 4.A B is A B-Good song, not an early one like the rest of the album. Notice how they removed the sh*tty Rappenstein song and replaced it with this? 5.Drink it up-This is just plain stupid. What the hell were they thinking? 6.Panic Zone-Prime example of why no one has ever claimed Arabian Prince to be their favorite member of NWA (his mother does not count) 7.LA is the Place-This is flat out annoying 8.Dopeman-early version, worth hearing if a big NWA fan 9.Tuffest man alive-AKA Worst Band Ever 10.Fat Girl-Funny if you listen to it once and never again 11.3 The hard Way-Even if this song were good, it's too late to save this album 
 James Adams' The Next World War was a disappointing read from an author who usually produces solid national security writing.    The book is an effort (originally written in 1998) to provide a survey of how future wars might be waged.  Divided into three parts, the book begins by providing an overview of the state of "information warfare," then discusses relevant applications of information warfare, and concludes by discussing how information warfare may impact US and global security.    While the book is a decent attempt to sum up innovative thinking in the world of security studies during the mid- to late-1990s, it suffers from a critical lack of focus.  The author introduces the concept of "information warfare" but discusses several topics (most notably non-lethal weapons) that appear only tangentially related to even the most generous definitions of information warfare.  In addition, like many books written during this time period, The Next World War argues that cyberwarfare, viruses, and hacking present the gravest threats to US security interests. This argument almost completely overlooks the importance of information warfare outside the cybersphere.  Terrorists, insurgents, and other non-state actors practice their own form of information warfare that falls largely outside of Adams' discussion.  In addition, while Adams' research was undoubtedly cutting edge in 1998, the rapid changes in information technology and military technology make some of his discussions seem antiquated.  While an interesting and relatively easy read, this book is too outdated and too broadly conceived to much use for today's readers.  Specialists in military technology and information warfare may find this a valuable addition to their libraries.  General readers and those interested in more up-to-date information on "information warfare" should opt for more recent studies.   
 We all know that there is a difference between gym science and lab science.  Some of us also feel like we have an edge, or a leg up by doing these "rudimentary" exercises.  In Pavel's book "The Naked Warrior" he follows this mantra.  He touts that somehow, the Russians are far more superior in every aspect of fitness.  Although he is knowledgeable in many areas, he shluffs off a lot of safety guidlines in all of his books.  I have read all but one of his books, and they leave a lot to be desired.  What really makes me believe this even more is that he tries to suck you into buying other products and books.  If you buy "Relax Into Stretch," you'll feel like you're not getting enough info because he's constantly plugging "Super Joints".  If you buy all of his books, you'll feel incomplete unless you subscribe to the website.  If you subscribe to the website, you'll feel incomplete unless you go to his certification course for his kettlebells.  He's a shrewd businessman, and deserves credit for that, however don't rely on his books for too much credible info.  Take what you can from them and bounce them off of other credible sources.  You'll find a lot of conflicting information.  
 I agree with the comment earlier that there is no why in the end.  Every reader wants to know why he committed such a heinous act.  If it is greed, greed is too simple for this book because everybody is greedy in one way or another.  Please, next time Grafton, let us in on the reason for a person's demise, especially if you have the audacity to take us back 30 years.  
 There is a reason this recording is the best selling jazz album of all time. The music is magical - I loved it when I was a teenager in the early 70's (despite being a "rock" fan), and it's still special 35 years later. I highly recommend getting the pure CD format.   This disc is not a pure CD - it is a special new format called DualDisc, with "CD Audio"* on one side, and DVD video content and 5.1 audio on the other side. Seems like a great idea, a great way to get people to buy CD's instead of downloading them. NOT! Notice that asterisk next to "CD Audio"? There is a warning on the outside of the disk that it does not comply with the strict CD-Audio format, and it may not play on some CD or DVD players. If that was the only problem with this disc I say fine - the risk is worth the possible reward.    But no. Despite the added content of the DualDisc format with various extras, the DualDisc format is treacherous, very treacherous. If you want to play this "CD" (DualDisc - CD side) on a computer, on a Windows machine it installs a small hidden piece of software on your machine altering the driver for your CD or DVD drive reducing the CD/DVD's functionality. I have not yet been able to reverse the damage this disc has done to my machine's software despite reading many posts about methods to do this. I never agreed to any software installation (I never would have), and yet my CD/DVD drives have lost the ability to do DMA. And to add insult to injury, the DualDisc - CD side will not play on my computer - I cannot even listen to it where I spend many hours a day. Outrageous.  I've wasted so much time on this DualDisc that I haven't had the time to watch the DVD side content. Unbelievable that I paid for this abuse - this is the way the publisher Sony/BMG - Columbia treats a legitimate customer? I don't have enough words to describe my loathing for the purveyors of this current DualDisc product.  This DualDisc seems to violate the first rule of customer relations - "treat your customers with respect. 
 The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.  As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?  Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion?  You read the book and decide.. 
 Future War would have been a great work of fiction.  It's intriguing subject matter and there are some really entertaining scenarios that would keep you turning pages long into the night.  However.  If you're in the market for a well-researched, factual account, you should probably look elsewhere, especially if you are, like myself, a relative new-comer to the whole non-lethal weapons field.  Col. Alexander gets some extraordinary things wrong.  He uses Ruby Ridge as an example of law enforcement gone wrong and to point up the need for non-lethal alternatives to lethal force.  No arguments there.  But he must have been thinking of a different Ruby Ridge, because in this one, Kevin Harris doesn't survive.  I found that interesting, seeing as how Kevin Harris ended up giving a report to the FBI and getting tried in a court of law after the standoff ended.  Reports of his death in this book are greatly exaggerated.  Col. Alexander would also like us to believe that Tazers don't burn.  Even in the Nineties, law enforcement was aware that Tazers burn the skin.  Several court cases have included evidence of the burn patterns unique to different models of stun guns.  He also seems to take great pleasure in claiming that they are never lethal, which is an interesting claim to make about something meant to deliver tens of thousands of volts of electricity into the human body.  "Never" is a word that an ostensibly learned man should not have employed to describe such a weapon, even given the state of knowledge in the 90s.    I won't spend this space dissecting the plethora of other errors I've found.  I just want to present a caution to anyone incautious enough to buy this book: before getting excited about any one claim, make sure you get the facts from another source.  You can't trust this book to be right 
 At least if you only watch the movie you will save yourself a lot of time, I on the other hand was not so lucky. It is often said that the book is much better than the movie but not in this case. I often found myself saying "Why am I still reading this!" I thought the book would never end. Don't waste your time if you really need to read a novel by the author then pick "A day late a Dollar Short."  
 If Tony Hillerman wrote this novel (novella actually), I sure can't tell. I have been a Chee/Leaphorn fan for many years, but this novel is not in the same league with Hillerman's other work. It is reminiscent of a 'B' movie. Instead of building suspense, the plot is laid out all too plainly, the characters are unreal, and the Chee/Bernie romance doesn't ring true.  I am amazed that it was published 
 I am a long-time Derailers fan but can't listen to them since the departure of Tony Villanueva.  Don't get me wrong, Brian Hofeldt is a talented singer and is very charismatic but without Tony it just doesn't work for me 
 David Barton:  does not know the law. does not know the constitution. manipulates the law to his own purposes. manipulates the constitution to his own purposes. Take a long hard look at his website to see what his aims are. He is whitewashing history in a very questionable and disturbing way. Is this a Christian thing to do? Is it a patriotic thing to do? Stacks of quotes about religion shed no light on the original purpose of the constitution itself. I could just as easily amass quotes from the founders regarding marriage and draw a conclusion that they would have seen it as a forced requirement for everyone everywhere 
 After a man is caught cheating in a poker game a lynch party is formed and the man is murdered.  Soon after the murderers begin dying violent and mysterious deaths.   Dean Martin plays a ramblin' gambler in FIVE CARD STUD, a movie that probably didn't, but certainly could have, pounded the fatal nail into the traditional western before handing the franchise over to the Italians.  Although it sells itself as a mystery/western - who's killing all these gambling varmints, anyhow? - a five-second study of the movie's poster will pretty much shuffle out who's the good guy, who's the bad guy, and who's going to ride into the sunset with Inger Stevens.     I watched this movie the first time years and years ago, back in the knee-britches days.  It's possible some of synapses fired and connected and I somehow, after a generation plus, remembered how the plot - and I use that term loosely - ran.  I doubt it, though.  FIVE CARD STUD doesn't bother itself with keeping an edge to the mystery.  Robert Mitchum plays a gun-toting preacher who opens a church soon after the lynching occurs, Roddy McDowell is an angry young man with a chip on his shoulder.  Katherine Justice plays the shapely tomboy sister of McDowell and Inger Stevens is wasted, again, as a hair-cutting floozie.  Both women, of course, have lips puckered for the six-shootin' gambling man Martin.   This one was pretty excruciating, and it's really tempting to blame it all on the bored, and boring, Martin.  That's probably not fair, though.  The script is murky, the dialogue laughable (at the wrong times,) and, like I said, the mystery is never all that much of a mystery.  Martin, like Mitchum, was best in movies that let him play it laid-back and coolly bemused.  He needs manic energy to react to - think Shirley MacLaine, a young Sally Fields, or even Jerry Lewis.  He doesn't have the chops to carry a movie without someone like that, though.  Mitchum could, but the movie doesn't put him at the center.  It wouldn't matter anyway, because the only hope for this trite oater would be razing the story and starting over.  About the only fun this one provides - besides a scene with Mitchum and Yaphet Kotto near the end - is trying to decide who looks more bored, Martin or Mitchum.  My money's on Mitchum, but Martin gives him a go at it.  A waste of a good cast, and, save for a scene or two, a waste of a viewer's time. 
 There are a lot of areas that home inspectors need to know that are not mentioned. If you know nothing about inspections then you could learn a few pointers from this book. If you have some knowledge already then there are other books that would be a much better choice than this one. Some areas in the book were wrong. I would read the other books in this field before buying this one

 I had to buy this book for a class; if you're interested in a historical perspective on instructional technology, you might find this interesting.  I didn't 
 This was a fun and very portable toy for my 18-month-old son.  Unfortunately, the elephant noise quit working after about 6 weeks of play, and then the monkey noise stopped working about 2 weeks later.  Also, the train easily comes off the track, but my son loves playing with the train that way, too.  He's very disappointed that the animals are now quiet 
 The hardcover edition of this dictionary is awful. The binding is originally constructed, with tight pages that cracked my edition beyond repair on the second day.  The dictionary itself is exceptionally good, making for easy reference. A paperback edition would be ideal.  This dictionary is also mediocre for referencing technical terms 
 This book is a review of the basic principles of design.  There are no photos of actual examples where all the principles and elements of design are displayed.  If you are looking for pictures of beautiful tables already  set, this book is not for you 
 This was assigned by my kid's English teacher and you had to want to read this thing.  It had some futuristic stuff to keep a certain sci-fi spark going, but the vocabulary you had to learn to follow the plot was tedious.  If you have a middle schooler who really devours books, this would be OK.  But if you are looking for easy digestion - look elsewhere 
 I expected a lot form this book, as Mr. Boulud's previous book was very good.  But this one is not so much a book of recipes or cooking techniques as it is a lot of pictures of wine bottles, Mr.Boulud's daily life and so on.  Also, a lot of pages made up of huge fonts which say too little but look too much.  Recipes are not good at all, if you can find any.  For example between pages 240 and 260 there is no single recipe but a lot of photographs of everything except recipes.  I personally wouldn't give a try to any one of his recipes.  The price for this book should be no more than $5.  Hence, please don't waste your money 
 I bought these for my 83 year old mom, she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out. We thought it would be a good deal for the price. She was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived, but as others have noted, these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount (almost 1/4 inch) which makes them rather top heavy. Unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes, these earrings are going to droop downwards, not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect. Needless to say, my moms ear lobes are very thin, as soon as she put them in her ears, they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle. She was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund 
 Wendell Berry is one of my favorite poets; I highly recommend 'Entries', 'The Timbered Choir, and his various collected and selected poems to anyone interested in language that is alive and powerful in evocatively imagistic and spiritual ways. But 'Given' left me a bit cold. These poems would be better suited to Berry's excellent agrarian commentary work; but as poetry they failed the genre a bit, coming off like bland polemics in a language all too flat. The work is not without some merit, but I would certainly give Berry's other collections a much higher priority 
 Back 2 Da Basics *1/2 Stars  Yo Gotti has made some decent albums, but this one is just so ridiculous and silly that it made me sick, gotti who thinks he put memphis on the map, has some good songs here and there, but the rest are just ridiculous, obnioxus and real pretentious.  This is not a good album  Thumbs Down 
 I was dying to get my hands on these after reading such wonderful endorsements.  I had nothing but high hopes.  I was totally open minded.  I thought it seemed too good to be true (low cal no carb noodles!) but hey, I'm an optimist.  Guess what? It is too good to be true!  I read about washing them and drying them.  I did.  No problem.  I added sauce.  I put them in my mouth.  The taste was not the problem it was the texture.  It was seriously like chewing rubber bands.  No noodle resemblence whatsoever.  I honestly can't understand those who rave about these, but, hey, to each his own 
 This strategy guide is really not necessary to play Destroy All Humans. First, the game is simple and the missions are self-explanatory. And second, if you suck at finding the hidden items, buy this or you may die. Otherwise, don't buy it. Plain and simple 
 I easily overlooked all of the issues that other people had with this watch.  It was close enough to being accurate since I was not looking for soemthing exact.  My two complaints are that it was not waterresistant at all even though it claimed to be and that after buying a new second watch that one broke within 4 months.  This is an unrelaible and cheaply manufactured item.  Spend a little more and get a watch that has a chest strap. They may be tedious but they work and they dont break down 
 I had high hopes for this movie for several reasons. First and foremost, the fact that it was produced by Mystique, who has put out some of the hottest softcore out there. Second, the cast. Tracy Smith, Catalina Larranaga, Susan Featherly-that is a superstar line-up as far as I'm concerned. Three of my all-time favorite girls. I'm set. I could really care less about the plot at this point. Now all they have to do is deliver the heat...and that is where this movie fails.  First, the plot. Daisy (Tracy Smith) is an uptight receptionist, newly hired to a photography company. The guys in the office are a bunch of chauvinists of the highest order, so they enlist Orlando (Jarod Carey), who Daisy has a crush on, to break her heart on a bet. Needless to say, Daisy eventually learns the truth and takes it upon herself to teach the guys a lesson. If you like your softcore more plot-oriented and dialogue driven, then this may be for you. In between the dialogue, you get a series of sex scenes, and only a couple of them are note-worthy.  Now the sex...or lack thereof. In fact, there are very few actual sex scenes in this movie. Susan Featherly is naked on a bed at the beginning of the movie, then never to be seen nude again. Catalina has 2 scenes, one a halfway decent b/g in a copy room, and a fairly hot g/g with the lovely Tracy. Tracy has the majority of the scenes, but most of them are either disappointing or frustrating. Her first sex scene comes via a daydream where she and Orlando (Carey) get it on Egyptian style, but that is cut off as soon as it starts to get interesting.  Tracy has another scene with Orlando that AGAIN gets cut off before anything really happens! When they finally do get together, it better have been worth the wait, right? Wrong. Slow, and boring is the only thing on the menu unfortunately. In fact the only scene that really delivers any heat is when Tracy tries out a new vibrator. She finally shows us the goods, and you'll wonder why the rest of the movie couldn't be like that.  There are other scenes with nudity, but only one other sex scene, and none of them are even worth mentioning. Blah is the only word that comes to mind. Beautiful girls, big budget, decent script (kudos to Ms. Larranaga for punching up some tolerable dialogue), but all of that means bupkus to a softcore movie if they can't deliver the passionate sex scenes.  With all the potential there, it must have taken a real concentrated effort to screw the pooch this badly. Not at all what I expected from the folks at Mystique 
 So here you have a silly novel by a Wannabe Vaudevillean, it would seem, inventring a grossly obese anti-hero who somehow is irresistable to Latina and Russian nymphomaniacs. Wearing the armor of "silly me" charicature, he proceeds to insult all ethnicities, but reserves his principal villification for the "Golly Burton" subsidiary KBR, supposedly attempting to obtain an (actually illegal) cost-plus U.S. LOGCAP contract to support a future American invasion of a hypothetical Orthodox Christian tribal country squeezed between the Moslem nations of the Caspian Sea litoral, a place supposedly with exhausted energy resources. Fairly good writing, but a nonsensical plot. Better luck next time 
 Alright, I will state that I was curious about this band about four years ago. I thought to myself: "Good Charlotte can't be that bad if they have so many 'hardcore' fans that go everywhere, buy everything and speak anything that is to do with Good Charlotte." Man, was I wrong. Good Charlotte sucks. They're basically a boy band that wears black clothes and wears eyeliner. Their music sounds like sped up emo music. You could describe their music as "emo with estrogen". MTV markets them to the teenybopper crowd. How so many young, impressionable kids can get suckered hook, line, and sinker into ANY of the garbage that this pathetic excuse of a band dumps onto them is beyond me. They definitely appeal to 12 year old kids, who have such a horrible life because they can't go to the mall and buy new clothes or get a new video game.  They are a whiny band that love to sing about how "horrible" and "tragic" their life is, meanwhile they are sitting in cash in their mansions. No one cares except for their legions of self-pitying fans who feel they can truly connect with GC's "deep" and "inspiring" so-called "music". They even have whiny ballads that sound like the rest of the "pop-punk" and "emo" genres at the moment. Yeah, GC is fuelled by teen angst and armed with extremely bad talent. I'm sorry kiddies but Good Charlotte is nothing more than pop. I'm 16 & I'm already getting tired of the new music because it is getting horrible & more horrible. It's a manufactured popularity contest now. With their mediocre cliched song lyrics, Good Charlotte are 100% worshipped by their demographic, pre-teen and teenage preppy girls (and flamer guys.) This group of pop icons do nothing more than create crappy music (which is charged to audiences at well over $50 per ticket) and find themselves on MTV acting like jackasses every chance they aquire for the pleasure of their braindead viewers.  Their fanbase consists of 12 year olds that think they know all about music, therefore claim that they have the right to say that "GC" are musical gods or are the "best punk rawk band eva!111!1!", while talented bands like The Beatles and Pink Floyd to them are "old" and "horrible". These 12 year olds can usually be found online, usually on message boards, with usernames like "XxGCIsDaBestPunkBandEvarxX" and "trU3_pUnk_raWk3r".  Conversations between members of their fan base may be similar to this:  Poser: I love Good Charlotte they're so punk they're so much cooler than all those other pop bands. Kid #2: Where did you hear them first? Poser: TRL, oh, and in Hot Topic.  Poser: Hey, wanna, like, go to a Good Charlotte concert next month? Poser 2: Yeah! And we can wear our studded bracelets and red and black pants that we bought at Hot Topic!  Teenybopper talking to herself: "Oh my gaaaawd. I hate my liiiife. I can relate to these guys sooooo much because nobody listens to me and everyone hates meee"  Ugh.  In the end, I recommend the following punk rock albums to those who have been victimized by Good Charlotte:  Raw Power - Iggy and the Stooges Ramones - The Ramones London Calling - The Clas 
 I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan; this is not one of her better stories.  The book jacket summary sounded very interesting to me, it had real potential to be a lighthearted, intriguing romance.  The book started out decent enough, I immediately liked the main character, Cate, and fell for her and her crazy Irish family.  At the same time I was falling for the Madigan's I was introduced to a not so loveable character, Patrick Pugg.  This guy is so annoying it really takes away from the rest of the story.  I feel he was inserted into the story to garner some laughs; unfortunately he had the opposite effect on me.  He constantly refers to himself in the third person, everything is "Pugg this" and "Pugg that."  It was exhausting and exasperating to read!  He had absolutely zero redeeming qualities; any normal person would have sprayed this guy with mace and taken out a restraining order.  For you Plum fans, think of all the faults and quirks of the character Albert Kloughn, add a few more, than multiply and magnify by 100.    The rest of the characters were endearing and likeable.  Kellen McBride is a loveable hero and it's easy to see why he and Cate are so attracted to one another.  The whole mystery of the missing drag queen roommate and the other surprises (don't want to spoil anything) also had some potential, but ended up falling flat for me.  The ending and the wrap up of the mystery was completely unbelievable and ridiculous.  And just when I'd think it couldn't get any more far fetched, it would.   While I know this is fiction, and I appreciate the land of make believe, I always prefer a little reality in my books.  The humor and the dialogue seemed really forced and childish to me.  Nothing in this book made me laugh out loud, like I normally do with a Janet read, I barely smiled at some parts.  Another problem with this story was the introduction of yet another dog.  I was happy this one didn't resort to the normal dog antics, but the dog thing is getting a bit stale for me.  Not the worst book I have read, but far from the best. If you're dying to read this book, I recommend borrowing it from a friend or your local library.  
 While this book is not an utter garbage, there's nothing remarkable about it either, at least in my opinion. There's a certain wit and charm to "Fat Girls...", but that in itself doesn't save it from being mediocre. Even though miss Peck says that she's not a professional writer, by any means, it still feels as if though you need be a part of her family in order to enjoy this book. There's no humor in here, despite whatever reviews are saying - its just a number of observations on life, good ones at that, but I was looking for something else.  Bonus points for an excellent books cover. 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 This book was not up to my expectations. Maybe I understood this introduction wrong- I hoped to find some hints to find great employees and some new ideas. Instead I read many times, that it is important to hire great employees and that they are not easy to find. To my opininon it is more like a childrens book, than for the adults. I am not a manager, but I read nothing new, instead I understood, that we are doing things ok already in our company. In real world things are not so easy and simple as in this book. At least not in Estonia, people are bit smarter. Some of the titles in this book were  longer that the chapters itself, I was lucky to get one good sentence per chapter 
  The Wizard of Oz said to Dorothy, "You had the power to go home all the time. You just had to realize it." That is the message of this book and others like it. Of course the realizing can be a journey and take some time and effort. But most importantly it has to be directly experienced, not just intellectually understood or faithfully believed.  I do not doubt the veracity of the people who have had their lives changed by reading this book and following its tenets. However, I must say that the most well intentioned self-help books often fail to achieve for their readers the desired effect. Not only do they fail but the rebound effect of that failure leaves the vulnerable reader/practitioner worse off then when they started.  I cannot recommend this book ( or the 10-day workshop) to anyone who is feeling down for any reason. Instead, I urge you to call a talk therapist and make an appointment; eat appropriately, get at least seven hours of sleep a night, and make sure you are doing something physical each day, like walking.   It's true, there is nothing wrong with you, but having the direct experience of that truth takes balanced thoughtful effort. Come on Totto, let's go home now 
 Strangely unsatisfying tell-all.  I distinctly felt that the book was more the writer's attempt to heal than a piece of literary work.  Heche shares much of her oddball therapy work, self-spun theories of her case, and dredged-up memories of abuse in her utterly messed-up childhood, but strangely enough reveals little of her SELF.  I felt I was pushed into the psychiatrist's own chair, not allowed to be merely a reader or (in the best case of autobiography) a kind of temporary confidante and friend.  I gotta hand it to her, it took some guts to own up to some of this (psychotic episode under influence of Ecstasy, for one), and I am sorry for her suffering as a child.  But perhaps SHE should have paid ME to read her unsavory chunk of insanity.  
 bad dialogue, bad scenario, unrealistic plot and absolutely impossible crimes, funny characters, comic judge and police force, bad writing, bad almost everything. can't imagine this is a popular writer who has won some awards. simply trerrible. have read thrillers and mysteries for over 30 years, this is one of the worst. how could it be with such high praises is beyond me. enjoy if you could but spare me with mercy 
 The critical reviewers are on target but unfortunately they don't dwell on the vast superficiality of the novel and the cut and paste, politically correct ramble that it is.  I bought the book at a discount in a small town in the U.S. where I live.  I was ecstatic that I could get the book so cheap, for I remember reading Prasannarajan's review in India Today, and I usually like what he says.  And if I remember right, Prasannarajan speaks well of this meandering trickle of a terrible tale.  I wish I had the patience to sit down and do a serious deconstruction of this "plotless plot" and "clueless narration" from a pretend writer who relies on a condensed version of the Gita, the first chapter of Radhakrishnan's tome on the Upanishads and whatever else he could lay his hands on to "learn" and "speak" about India.  Dilettantism therefore is in powerful and peerless display 
 I am a product of the Compton school system, and I have taught here for the last 15 years. In that time I have come across a number of Teach for America (TFA) teachers, who are generally young white Ivy League graduates who have set out to save us poor black and brown folks. We refer to TFA in my teacher lounge as "teach for a while," as most of these folks use Compton as the launching point for their graduate school applications. I'd like to read a book about a teacher who has stayed in the classroom for more than a couple of years. TFA is a nice idea, but I question whether they do more harm than good by becoming part of children's lives and then taking the first bus out of town 
 Often hailed as genius, Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood proved far from that lofty title for me. First I read the play. Next I saw a University of Richmond production and finally, I read the play again. I thought I was missing out, somehow, and decided to discuss the play with one of my former theatre professors. At last, I've concluded that although some may find beauty in the so called poetry of Thomas' language, I find nothing but confusion - both for the reader and the audience member. I am a theatre professional and I would not choose to mount a production of Under Milk Wood at any cost. I fear I'd lose the audience 
 This is one of the best children's books ever written but it is a mini version of the book and was not portrayed as one.  It is over priced for the product.  I sent an email regarding my bewilderment  to Amazon and got no response 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 While I agree with all the other reviews on how this book is EXCELLENT for learning the introduction (and some advanced) concepts and applications of Direct 3D it is severely lacking one thing: game programming mechanics.  Frank D. Luna has an awesome ability to teach Direct 3D in an easy to understand and fun way but this is not a book to buy if you want to learn how game systems and mechanics interface with direct 3d.  There is no game project nor is there any helpful information on animation/sound/or comprehensive explanation of DirectInput (though there is a really nice camera class you create in the book).  Anyway...I give this book 2 stars not because it lacks validity or helpful notes, as was stated earlier its really well organized and easy-to-understand.  But don't expect to come out of this book without any questions about D3D games because there is a lot that he doesnt cover.  I still recommend this book to anybody interested in graphics programming and back it up with full support in that respect 
 I bought this book based on all the reviews posted on Amazon.com. I must say I was extremely disappointed. The book does not describe even a single machine learning algorithm adequately - no pseudocode, no mathematical description, and at the end of the day, no real understanding. If you are an analytically challenged manager who wants to pick up a bunch of buzzwords to throw around to impress your equally analytically challeged colleagues or customers who don't have a clue, this might be the book for you - a n overpriced, highly overrated "data mining for dummies". If you want to learn something about machine learning, well.. stick to books like Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell or Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 
 Good luck actually getting this item.  Delivery is a severe problem.  I have been back-ordered three times.  Latest estimate is 7 weeks after the order was placed.  Recommend you call your local bookstores for stock instead of relying on false delivery promises, especially if this is a gift.  
 Legend, Lies & Cherished Myths of American history is a misleading title.  Do not assume this book to among likes of James Lowen's publications.  Some aspects of the book seem factual.  However, many arguements he makes such as the American revolution was not revolutionary at all, are completly rediculous.  This is yet another book in this kind of genre based upon assumptions and poor research. Avoid it at all costs.    Brian DeDentro (Rhode Island College 
 It would have been good to know that this was a children's book before I ordered it.  I oredered it thinking it was something that would be helpful for an adult.  I would not have ordered it 
 I'm a big fan of the Golden Age characters. If you enjoy these original heroes, and their continuing stories, you might not enjoy the last few surviving characters acting without good judgment. I'm one of the people that think the outcome of Crisis was poor. The multiverse was not so messy that we have to lose all our golden age characters. Earth 2 was a place where it was okay for heroes to age, retire, and train the next generation of heroes.  This book gives us northing original, it's boring, and abuses good characters to no good end. It uses the time tested gimmicks of having a "Hero Go Bad", "Bringing back characters that seemed forgotten", "involving everyone", "Wonder Woman kills someone(gasp...yawn)", and so on.  Been there, done that, have the bumper sticker, T-Shirt, coffee mug, snap shots, and the key chain. 
 I thought this would be an actual toilet monster, and was happy to see such a low price. It is, however, made out of rubber, and can not actually eat people 
 My friend started this book a month and a half ago and still hasn't finished it - and problably never will. It's hard to understand what it's about, the material is dry & unclear. According to her, reading it is torture 
       This encyclopedia is for true believers in the Post Keynesian tradition of Joan Robinson,G L S Shackle and Paul Davidson.Unfortunately, this approach to economics can't operationalize any of the analytic tools and concepts Keynes developed in  the A Treatise on Probability in 1921(TP)or in the General Theory in 1936(GT).An obvious place to start is the failure of Post Keynesians to operationalize Keynes's concepts of the weight of the evidence in the TP,uncertainty in the GT and probability in both the TP and GT.Keynesian probability is fundamentally of an interval nature.It is quantitative and at the same time noncomparative,nonrankable,and incommensurable if any of the interval estimates overlap.The source of this analysis is chapters 15,17,20,and 22 of the TP.Weight of the evidence,w,is an index that measures the completeness of the relevant,potential,available evidence upon which probability estimates will be based.Keynes defined it as 0<=w<=1.If w=0,then you are dealing with what Keynes called ignorance in the TP.A w=0 would also hold in the 1937 Quarterly Journal of Economics article if"We simply do not know!"Other names would be complete or total uncertainty or the fundamental uncertainty of the Shackles and the Davidsons.w's between 0 and 1 represent cases of partial knowledge and partial ignorance.Here a set of different probability distributions or a set of intervals would have to be constructed.A w=1 allows a decision maker to specify a single unique probability distribution or interval.Given a strict application of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers,suppose that the data passed the Lexis Q-test for stability.Keynes would then agree that one could apply a normal probability distribution since an analysis of the data would support such a conclusion as long as the data was homogeneous in its composition throughout the series or sequence.Now let us turn to the GT.Keynes was quite clear that uncertainty is a function of the weight of the evidence.As the weight of the evidence increases,uncertainty decreases.As the weight of the evidence decreases,uncertainty increases.u=f(w).If w=0,then uncertainty is total and no estimates of probability are possible.In this case,the decision maker would exhibit a very high liquidity preference and tend to rely on heuristics,rules of thumb,habits,memory,conventions or a follow the crowd approach 
 Unfortunately, despite the fact that it advertises that it will fit any doorway, I have high baseboards on each side of the opening and only one side of the gate adjusts to accomodate high baseboards.  It was not sturdy at all, returned it 
 I bought this book because I expected it to be a long-awaited branching-out of Ms. de la Cruz's from teen chick-lit to something a bit more serious.  Being a bit of an outcast myself I expected to sympathize with the character of Schuyler van Alen.  However, while the main plotline of the story was just as shallow, if not more so, than The Au Pairs, the secondary prologue plotline was what truly disappointed me.    I am a writer.  I am not published, and I'm only eighteen, but what I do a lot of in my free time is write.  And when I'm not writing about made-up fantasy worlds, sometimes I actually have to do research about our own world for the book to make sense. Ms. de la Cruz, and her editors, seem to not care about this at all.  I realize that she grew up in the Phillippines and therefore the history of the Mayflower might not have been as ingrained into her childhood as it was into mine.  But a bit of internet research could have prevented her from making the painful errors she made in writing this book.  For example:   1. On page three, the first entry, the writer states: "it has been a difficult winter" as her opening comment.  If you will notice the date on the top of the page, it is November 21st.  November is not winter.  Nor, as the narrator later states, have the settlers even docked yet.  The difficult winter did not occur until the settlers had arrived in Plymouth.  2. About Plymouth.  They spelled it `Plimoth' at the time.  3. On page 56, the second entry, the narrator writes: "... joyful news-- the people of this new land have welcomed us with open arms and many gifts.  They brought us wild game, a large bird that could feed an army, a bunch of vegetables, and maize."  This is supposedly the 25th of November, 1620.  The Indians did not meet the Pilgrims until March 16th, 1621.  The first Thanksgiving, as de la Cruz alludes to, was not celebrated until August of that year.  The reason the Pilgrims suffered through their first winter was their isolation from other people, including the Indians.  The narrator also states: "...we are heartened by the sight of the verdant land, the vast virgin acres."  Other than the nauseatingly blatant and inept attempt at alliteration, I wonder exactly how `verdant' the `acres' could have looked in late November in Massachusetts.  Interesting how de la Cruz first calls November winter, and then suddenly it's spring!    4. On page 80-- diary entry three-- the narrator states: "Today Myles Standish took a team down the coast the Roanoke to bring medicine, food, and supplies to the settlers there.  It is a fortnight's sail, so they will be gone a good while."  This is the thirtieth of November.  Need I reiterate my previously made point about the Plymouth settlers' isolation?  They would have had no contact with Roanoke.  Furthermore, the Plymouth/Plimoth colonists did not have extra medicine, food or supplies, they barely had enough for themselves.   5. On pages 125 and 184, the last two diary entries, the narrator writes: "The men have been gone for days now, and still there is no word.  We are frightened.  They should have arrived there and returned by now, with news of the colony.  But all is silent," and "Alas!  Alas!  Everyone from Roanoke is disappeared.  Myles and the men found nothing of the colony," respectively.  These entries were for December 20th and 23rd, respectively.  Let's think about this, shall we?  Aside from the fact that the words "Alas!  Alas!" reek of something I might have written to show `emotion' in the third grade after reading too much historical fiction, the "journey to Roanoke" would take a fortnight, as stated in entry three.   That means a round trip would take two fortnights.  As in four weeks.  November 30th-December 20th isn't even three weeks.   The men should not have been back by then, nor should they have come back on December 23rd.  They should have come back on December 28th. As I said before, I am eighteen.  My elementary school teachers drilled the story of the pilgrims into us from a very young age.  I am surprised, after reading the reviews by everyone else on here, that no one else picked up on this very crucial fact. How do I catch things that published authors and paid editors do not?  Are the powers that be at Hyperion all exceptionally bad at American History, or have they let Ms. de la Cruz get away with shoddy writing and fact-checking simply because they know the success of her earlier Au Pairs books would lead to millions buying this book (followed by the continued dumbing-down of American teenagers)?  That they would let something so blatantly wrong onto bookshelves astounds me.  Most authors know to do research before writing-- in fact, most high schoolers do-- and this was a slap in all of our faces. I already wrote all of this in a letter to Hyperion asking them to revise or recall the book, but like the ostriches they are, they have done nothing to this effect. People!  Don't accept this sort of shoddily-written tripe!  Look at what I have to say and don't hesitate to follow me in petitioning Hyperion and Ms. de la Cruz 
 I like the show just fine, but you should probably double check the pricing on the individual season sets.  As it stands now, this is more expensive than just putting the 3 season sets in your cart separately 
 I was one of the Ambivalents when it came to Auster and his NYC-branded mysteriso until I picked up this insipid and downright egotistical meta-blah novel. Maybe I was supposed to despise the writer-slash-narrator lost in the rabbit hole of who's-the-real-puppet-anyway as Leviathan unfolds? Obnoxious as it may seem (and is); Leviathan is about a writer writing Leviathan about a writer who already wrote Leviathan. And just to make things interesting the "writer" smells faintly of (who else) Paul Auster who is (of course) writing the novel. Yippie.  Being a fan of Lydia Davis, I didn't exactly appreciate the treatment of her "character" nor did I like the sparkly little sex-studded attempts Auster makes at describing (oh, come on... I'll just say INVENTING) his own psychological and personal growth. Oh, but if ONLY Auster DID grow as a writer. THEN, I'd be interested.  But in reality, Paul Auster can do little more than write (more poorly) the same novel he began writing all those years ago. The same writer-ordained set of chance occurrences spun into a meta-noir plot make Leviathan a tired, if not utterly despicable novel. Why do I say despicable? Because I'm sure Auster can do better. I feel his intelligence throbbing underneath the muscular ego-laden re-hash of fantasies he should have let go when he was 16 years old.   Leviathan reveals what I don't want to know about yee urban readers: a book on the subway is worth twice its weight in cocktail party conversation. Come on everybody! Let's all go theorize about the "real" Paul Auster! Have a gin tonic and watch yourself on the fire escape.  
 Who can claim this is the ultimate book?  Who is the editors of homeowner?  I don't trust this book since I don't see an author's name attached.  Authors are more credible even though editors make more 
 I bought this  book hoping that it would investigate today's financially status oriented world. In this task the book starts off quite well reviewing Nixon's visit to Russia.  The biggest problem I have with this book is that it drifts off the subject to look at how status has  been covered by other authors and artists.  To me, the book, particularly with its enumerated layout, reads more like someone who's written a ph.D thesis and desperately wants to cover those things that  someone reviewing it would be impressed to see, throwing in a few graphs for good measure. Unfortunately to the layperson it is very hard to get through. For example at the end of the section on philosophy it reads "To heed the misanthropic philosophical council we must surrender our puerile obsession with policing our own status..." Yeah, right!  De Botton doesn't really seem to be writing for the reader, more for himself, and a very intellectual audience, who probably will nod and agree with everything he says, because they too are impressed they know so much too.  It's a shame that the book has turned out how it has as I think the subject would have made an entertaining read if written in a different style.  I was going to give it one star, but De Botton has clearly researched his subject well whic earns it an extra star, but don't expect to learn anything you don't know already 
 I rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school.  This video made its rounds in the public schools.  The songs are catchy and the film quality is good.    But make no mistake, this is propaganda aimed at children.  I will not be showing it to my kids.  Despite the freewheeling title, the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys.    Case in point:  Atalanta, a princess, finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world (on her father's horse).  She also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time.  Juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of "ladies first."  The tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron.  The narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal.  Our "hosts", infant puppets voiced by Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas, are revolting.  There should be a law against using Mel Brooks' voice for a baby.  Apparently, I repressed memories of these creatures, but seeing them again brought back the horror.  Needless to say, I fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry.  Overall, this DVD is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children 
 In today's world, various forms of parochialism have a dialectical relationship with the homogenizing influences of globalizing consumer capitalism. These forms of parochialism may be ethnic, "cultural," religious, nationalistic, etc., depending on where you look. On one hand, ancient forms of identity continue to define in-groups and out-groups; on the other hand, multinational corporations elide these differences as they operate in a wider and wider worldwide marketplace.  Example: the Turks and the Armenians hate each other and even partly define themselves by this ancient conflict ("Jihad" is Barber's label for this); yet they see the same Pepsi ads and do the same kinds of work in their local Pepsi bottling plants ("McWorld" is Barber's label for this).  That's the book.   This might be a useful resource for writers of term papers who need to endnote something fairly obvious. Outside of that, it would take an observer from another planet to find this book's insights novel or pointed. If you're new to planet Earth, by all means pick up a copy. It will catch you up on a few useful truisms.  As others have pointed out, the "terrorism's challenge to democracy" subtitle seems intended to capitalize on 9/11, but doesn't accurately reflect the book's content. "Jihad" is deployed as a synecdoche in this book; Muslim extremism is just one of the book's many examples of parochialism 
 I was really looking forward to this book. I'm not sure when I have been so disappointed in a story after all of the hype.  I was raised in mid-west and expected a serious story about trials of a disfunctional family. What a total waste of time. Turd fantasy is not my idea of great literature. Worst book I have read since "Running with Scissors".  I don't need to waste my time on this psychotic drivel parading as great art 
 Warning this book will cause your IQ to drop by several points. Mr Duke using flawed and false research and broken reasoning to make the same old tired racist claims of  superiority of the white race.   The views being no diferent than when he was spouting them as a member of the KKK, same old pig but with new lip stick. what magazine/comic book did he apply to for his PHD? The only people who will find this book useful will be those wishing to re-enforce the same point of view. 
      This novel could have been a long short story or a novella. One event takes place in the story and Perez-Reverte milks it for all he can. There are plenty of  historical  persons such as poets, playwrights, and painters thrown it. This is basically a one episode tale. I rate this a B-. 
 The last song of Billy's Joel's album, "The River of Dreams" seemed to be somewhat appropriate.   On the song, "Famous Last Words", Billy sings the words "These are the last words I have to say; That's why this took me so long to write; There will be other words some other day; But that's the story of my Life".   Billy Joel would soon proclaim that his 13th studio album, 1993's "The River of Dreams" would be his last original Rock/Pop album he would do.  Following that album, Billy Joel would assume a place as an "elder statesman" of Rock.  Instead of creating new music, he would spend his time touring (solo and with Elton John), doing the College Lecture series (discussing his music), and dabbling in Classical Music (he released a Classical Instrumental album - i.e. no words called "Fantasies and Delusions").   In a way, Billy would go into semi-retirement.  The release of "Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume 3" was a way for Billy to provide some closure to the work included on the latter albums. In 1985, Billy released a double CD entitled "Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume I and II".   For all practical purposes, "Greatest Hits Volume 3" covers the last decade of his career.    While this does provide some closure, I find this a most disappointing effort.  I look at Billy Joel's career as having three phases.  The first phase is what I call "Old Billy Joel".    This basically includes all of his material from "Cold Spring Harbor" through "Turnstiles".   These are perhaps the strongest days as the piano sound, but they also contain most of Joel's least heard material.   The next phase is what I call "Middle Billy Joel".  This was his most successful period and covers from "The Stranger" to "Billy Joel Greatest Hits Volume 1 and 2".  Joel would go through a transition during this phase - expanding his musical horizons and exploring different avenues.  The final phase is the "Later Billy Joel" phase - this covers "The Bridge" to "River of Dreams".  In this phase, Billy would start to incorporate some of his older styles of music while not abandoning his desire to continue to explore new avenues. For the most part, "Greatest Hits Volume 3" focuses on Phase 3 - "Later Billy Joel".   Although "Greatest Hits Volume I and II" covered Billy's last studio album of Phase 2, "An Innocent Man" - there are two songs on "Greatest Hits Volume 3" from that album that were not on "Greatest Hits Volume I and II".  "Greatest Hits Volume 3" includes 14 tracks from Billy's last 4 studio albums.  "An Innocent Man" ("Keeping the Faith", "An Innocent Man");  "The Bridge" ("A Matter of Trust", "Baby Grand", "This is the Time"); "Storm Front ("Leningrad", "We Didn't Start the Fire", "I Go to Extremes", "And So it Goes", "The Downeaster 'Alexa'"); "The River of Dreams ("Shameless", "All About Soul", "Lullabye (Goodnight My Angel)", and "The River of Dreams")   In addition - as with most "Greatest Hits collections" there are three new tracks.   Billy sort of keeps to his promise on "These are the last words I have to Say" in that the new songs are written by other people.  The songs are "To Make You Feel My Love" (a Bob Dylan song), "Hey Girl", and "Light as the Breeze".  There are several reasons why I advise against this particular Billy Joel collection:  - Billy would release a modestly boxed set called "Billy Joel: Complete Hits Collection" that includes the remastered version of "Greatest Hits Volume I and II", "Greatest Hits Volume 3", and a fourth disk that includes outtakes and live versions from a College Tour he did.   You get everything on "Greatest Hits Volume 3" in this collection.  Unless you want to "fill the gaps", you should carefully consider the 4-disc Boxed Set first because it is a better value.  - I think much of the charm of the "Latter Billy Joel" phase were some of the "hidden gems" of songs.  These weren't necessarily commercially successful songs, but still had good quality.   It is disappointing that "Volume 3" doesn't include these hidden gems.  Songs such as "Running on Ice", "Modern Woman" ("The Bridge"); "That's Not Her Style", "When in Rome" ("Storm Front"); "No Man's Land", "Two Thousand Years", "Famous Last Words" ("The River of Dreams") are missing.   The omission of "Modern Woman" really surprised me.  I think this song gets a bum rap from the critics. .  - Taking out the two songs from "An Innocent Man" and the three new songs.   This collection really only covers three albums: "The Bridge", "Storm Front", and "The River of Dreams".   This really isn't enough for a greatest hits collection.  As mentioned Billy includes three new songs by outside songwriters. The one thing that I liked about all three songs is that there is a piano element in each of them.  The best of the three songs is "Hey Girl".  This song has a very soulful/R&B feel and it is something different by Billy.  I would go as far as to say that this is a great Billy Joel song.  This song features some terrific background vocals.  I also like the horns in it.    The other two songs aren't quite as strong, but still of good quality..  "Light as the Breeze" had more of a classic Billy Joel "Piano" and "Horn" elements, but this song never really grabbed me.  With the exception of the percussion, "To Make You Feel my Love" didn't really feel like a Bob Dylan song - but it still wasn't that bad.    While this collection is probably worth it for the new songs, my advice would be to try to get the Boxed Set "Billy Joel: Complete Hits Collection". This is the one Billy Joel album that disappoints me.  With the exception of the new songs, all this collection does is provide closure - but it really isn't going to provide the value from a Billy Joel compilation you would expect. 
 This is a book by someone who obviously loves corvids but is unequipped for realizing the task she set herself.  The "fabulous" part of the book deals with old world history in two sentences, spending the rest of the space on folksy retellings of stories from Native American traditions.  The "natural" part of the history is anecdotal, sentimentalized and inadequate.  Other works serve far better for each of this one's stated purposes 
 All of Huston Smith's life, God or the cosmos, if you will, tried to speak to him as to all of us. It seems he rejected much of the "music of the spheres" as they did not sound like the stories taught to him by his parents as a child in rural China.  Thus, much of the middle portions of his life were devoted to learning about other religions and teaching others what he had learned. He in fact became renown as a scholar of other religions. This was easy enough to do as so few scholars had any similar interests in world religions. It also avoided addressing the subtle background "music of the spheres" which modernity has labeled as "science." This music intruded often and has usually received a brittle response from Dr. Smith. How could one know it was not the voice of God?  This book impresses as a summation of the prodigal scholar who has come home to reclaim his religious inheritance. Here is his testimony. There is an air of dogmatism in some passages. The reader must judge where enthusiasm ends and rigidity begins.  While he was away learning about other religions, scholars of his own faith have revealed, in the last 75 years, a vastly different picture of Christianity from that  comprehensible in rural China. For example, before the author holds forth on Original Sin again he might read the brilliant treatise on the matter by Dr. Tatha Wiley. There is no evidence at all of Smith's awareness of  this  current field of knowledge.   This may surprise those who think of Smith as a broad scholar of religion with penetrating insights into human aspirations and conditions.  But the author is clearly no Joseph Campbell whose friendship he claims.  Some of the recent scholarship of Smith's faith encourages more humility and less certitude as real study often does. Portions of this book ring of rigid faith and less of scholarship.  To speak of "absence-of-evidence" in the final pages of this book is befitting. It is also terribly sad. So much seems to have been missed. Where does the absence lie?  The real "absence" is the realization on the author's part that he could have answered the question: "why dost thou kicketh against the pricks" in another fashion. He could have responded with, yea, verily the deity before which I would bow is able to design a cosmos with all these elements, the modern, the secular and above all, the music of the spheres as heard in the songs of science! But to lovingly embrace science would have been a heresy unto death. Maybe all of creation can never really be understood nor embraced by most of us.  What we have is vintage "Smith-ing," hammering the modern, science and the secular on the anvil of  traditional dogma. Of course, no one can fault a man, even an imminent scholar, for writing of his faith. To be sure, this book attempts to capture the "soul" of  a single religion.   Zeal would demand the author's religion be described as the most preeminent in the world as is attempted here. However,  insight over a lifetime of long study might lean more to "there are many paths" of truth. This we do not find  here. The final sorting out of which religion is truly the "Great Tradition" is yet to come. Then, maybe, all the evidence will be in.  The author begins by speaking of two revolutions. One being the  past "disastrous" move of the Western world  to  modernity which pushed the human spirit to "the margins." The other revolution is the current correction  bringing "God back into the picture."  No honor is due to fundamentalist diatribes or anything close to them. However, it should be at least acknowledged that  the reader  of  "The Soul of Christianity" may be  witnessing  the twilight of one man's  attempt to return religion from the modern era to a world of the prescientific past!                            
 First, it was published too soon. When I got to the end,I discovered the suspect in the case hasn't even had a trial yet. When I read a true crime book I want to know the conclusion of the case. Second, apparently there wasn't enough information for a whole book because the author had to resort to using numerous other unrelated cases as filler. And that is what makes the third thing wrong with this book. The author jumps around from case to case so much that it is distracting. I got a headache just trying to keep all the names, places and cases in order. If you still want to read this book; at least wait until they print an updated version after the trial is over. Then you will know how the story ends 
 I was surprised to find this book not only still in print, but enthusiastically reviewed by so many who obviously take it seriously.  For those willing to do a little background research into Casteneda and his subject matter it will quickly become apparent that the events detailed in 'The Teachings' did not, and could not have occurred as described.  Space prevents me going into detail here, but I have a review on my website at:  http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/redcrow/CTOMBS/Articles/Castanedax.ht 
 Packer is considered by many to be an excellent scholar, and with that said, about half of his chapters are well thought out, and quite good for the one or two pages he gives them. However, the problem starts in that the rest are steeped in Reformed traditions, and not necessarily, the plain revealed Word in Scripture. He relies too heavily on Augustine and Calvin instead of trying to work things out on his own. He sticks with the System. In many of his chapters, he comes across as arrogant and offensive to anyone who doesn't hold to his particular flavor of Reformed theology. He intentionally uses extreme and elitist labels to belittle other viewpoints. Packer, as with many of the High Calvinists, doesn't hesitate to put dissenters into any extreme category. In this book, Packer doesn't have to worry about being accused of being humble or irenic.   As a High Calvinist, he also continues the tradition of emphasizing the work of Law over Grace in sanctification. His other chapters are highly seasoned with Law as well. He has 3 chapters that emphasize Law and not one on Grace! Someone should give him a copy of Romans and Galatians. In addition, Packer doesn't hesitate to use only those verses which seem to support his position. The rest are ignored. If you buy into the dogmatic System of logic and Reformed traditions, over the plain Word of God, then this is the book for you. For the rest, please look elsewhere, or at least read it with an open study Bible that lists the verses that don't agree with him.  
 The John Silence stories are not among Blackwood's more inspired creations. Even the best of them tend to conclude with a pompous "explanation" of the supernatural events, as Blackwood attempts  to propagandise for his personal brand of mysticism. This is all very well,  but if you don't happen to share Blackwood's beliefs it's no more than an  irritation, and even if you do it might well bring you down to earth with a  bump after some of his fine atmospheric writing in the better tales. It's a  pity that S T Joshi, who made much the same observations in his excellent  "The Weird Tale", couldn't have persuaded Dover to bring out,  instead, Blackwood's truly astounding collection, "Incredible  Adventures", from which Silence's tiresome explicitness is almost  entirely absent 
 The tracks are great.  Much better than the original versions.  But I can't (easily) rip this CD so that I can listen to it in my house.  Thus the product itself is useless.  I'd give this product a negative if I could 
 Shevonne the imperial hoodrat or whatever you claim to be.....you wouldn't know about being a hustler if Ice-T slapped you with your tampon. Its painfully obvious that you don't have any music knowledge due to the fact you enjoy ignorant, inbred, klown music. I am sure you do relate to the lyrics because you definitely have the iq of a tree frog. And no I will never reach that level.......or should I say sink to that level because I never move backwards with my intellect only forward.   Dem Wack boyz are one of th worst groups out there to date.  Support real emcees like Mos Def, KRS-One, and Immortal Technique 
 I found it very difficult to follow the authors meaning throughout this book.  There seemed to be a great effort to include supporting scripture to back up her conclusions, although I found that often the scripture references had little or no relevance to the topic being discussed.  Many scriptures seem to be taken out of context and have been misinterpreted in an effort to support her views, many of which have nothing to do with animals.  This book is also filled with constant repetition, which I found very annoying to say the least.  One of numerous examples of this is her need to identically translate the same Hebrew and Greek words 3 or 4 times within the same 3 to 4 pages.   Her discriptions of vocally explaining heaven and souls directly to her cat in the belief that this will somehow offer her cat an "advantageous place" in heaven and include the cat in the "advanced class" in heaven were offensive.  In addition, she was unable to back this belief up with any Bible scriptures.  Overall, this book was very disappointing and not the least bit helpful.  Thankfully, I have since found several other very well written books by different authors that do a much better job of proving animals go to heaven, which has been a great blessing to me. 
 This has to be one of my favorite films. It is a shocking, powerful, and very tragic tale that leaves you breathless. I also think this is Monica Belluci's best role. However, with that said, this DVD release is total crap. I saw the international version earlier and really liked it, so I recommended to my friends that we rent it. To my dismay the american version  was highly edited and terrible. They took out much of the "questionable" content, which resulted in a film with no flow and ultimately lacking in sense. It's ridiculous how our country has gone to such such extreme censorship procedures. I feel it is this kind of repression that really contributes to the moral decay of our country as a whole (sorry for being on my soap box...).  I suggest anybody who criticized this film to see the real version as Tornatore intended it to be. 
 This book talks about statistical approach to horse racing by evaluating the frequency and return of each type of bets.  However, the explanations of those statistical findings are not enough.  I believe if the statistical finding tells you something, we should still need to understand the rationale behind and why statistical finding comes out like this.  The second half of this book is all charts in resepct of findings from different race tracks in the US, which however need readers to digest and evaluate what's inside.  There is even no explanation of why the charts look in this way.  In other words, half of this book only contains a presentation of data without really goes deep to analyse what's happening.  This book is not good enough. 
 I have not even opened this because the first two CDs I ordered from Amazon sounded like they were fake 
 I'm always amazed about people who study the Bible in order to find there errors. They have a lot to say, but it is vanity of vanities. If somebody cares about this topic, try to find "Forever Settled" by Jack Moorman. ISBN 1888328061 
 Now, don't get me wrong: I'm sure "Charles Olson...was good at a great many things; writing poetry happened never to be one of them.  This book, which  includes the better part of his life's work, is just plain silly; the text  is written in strange spirals and turns, & it's nearly impossible to  figure out what he's talking about half the time.  It's reminiscent in some  places of the work of Robert Pinsky, but without Pinsky's characteristic  cleverness, wordplay, and lyricism.  It resembles, in other places, the  maritime verse of Samuel Sewell, but it remains far more elusive than  Sewell would ever have allowed.  And, while it brushes at times towards an  almost Tolstoyan eroticism, it drops swiftly into the scatalogical --  rather tastelessly, one might add.  I certainly don't recommend it for the squeamish, or anyone of delicate  sensibilities 
 I am a minimalist to the fullest, but this book simply lacks depth. The "blueprints" are hardly viewable, let alone descriptive. Most of the structures resemble eachother and are spare, without furnishings or signs of life. I would recommend the book, "PREFAB" by Allison Arieff for bigger pictures, broader concepts and more in depth explanations. I suppose they were making a point by making the size of the book compact, but the few times I was impressed with a structure I would scour the three or so pages devoted to it and then it was over, leaving me wanting much more. Try classics like, "Pierre Koenig", by James Steele or "Julius Shulman: Architecture and Its Photography" by Peter Gossel. Ta T 
 I bought this about a year ago based on great reviews.  I'm not surprised to see bad reviews a year later.     Problems: The uneven weight difference causes the Aria to pull   The small wheels grab into anything softer than concrete (forget the grass at the park)  The trays are too small for sippy cups and more than a couple of cheerios The fabric storage area underneath is held up with six "buttonholes" that tore after a few uses with a not very heavy diaper bag The straps are really tricky to figure out and I've never been able to get them right The shades are very small and next to worthless The drink holder is negligible and sometimes interferes with opening and closing the stroller  For the money I spent I wish I'd been less afraid of getting something a little heavier and go with a jogger style with a swivel front wheel.  It's amazing how weight of a stroller is an issue with your first child, but how Herculean you become once you have two.  Also, the whole one-handed open-close feature that I craved on my single stroller is a non-issue when you have two kids because it's safest to have them strapped into carseats before dealing with the stroller anyway.  If I could, I'd sell this one and get a jogger (I need something that moves on the mulch and grass at the playground) but I don't think I could sell this one for more than $20 in clear conscience.  A shame 
 I find Graham Greene to be almost unreadable. I know that this is going to be considered near blasphemous, since literary critics have heaped such praise upon him and so many reviewers here have done likewise.   However, in a word, I find him depressing. His characters suffer from interminable analysis of their every thought and action. The larger story is merely a vehicle for these internal monologues that, frankly, I don't find particularly insightful or interesting. It was V. S. Pritchett who first remarked about Greene's 'perverse and morbid tendencies'. While Greene is no doubt highly intelligent and capable of a very high level of writing, the end result, for me, is something very unpleasant.   I first read 'The Heart Of The Matter'. God, what an endlessly depressing scene! Nor was there any particular character I could sympathize with or even care about. In spite of my negative reaction to this highly praised work, I thought I would give him another try with 'Orient Express' (a.k.a., 'Stamboul Train'), thinking that in this 'entertainment' as Greene called it I would actually be, well, entertained. Instead, I get a trainload of depressing characters whose every thought is scrutinized to an excruciating degree.   Example (from Myatt's suspicions about his business dealings):  'It was odd. He had chosen the samples with particular care. It was natural of course that even Stein's currants should not all be inferior, but when so much was suspected, a further suspicion was easy. Suppose, for example, Mr. Eckman had been doing a little trade on his own account, had allowed Stein some of the firm's consignment of currants, in order temporarily to raise the quality, had, on the grounds of that improved quality, indeed, induced Moults' to bid for the business. Mr. Eckman must be having uneasy moments now, turning up the time-table, looking at his watch, thinking that half Myatt's journey was over. Tomorrow, he thought, I will send a telegram and put Joyce in charge; Mr. Eckman shall have a month's holiday. Joyce will keep an eye on the books, and he pictured the scurrying to and fro, as in an ants' nest agitated by a man's foot, a telephone call from Eckman to Stein or from Stein to Eckman, a taxi ordered here and dismissed there, a lunch for once without wine, and then the steep office steps and at the top of them the faithful rather stupid Joyce keeping his eye upon the books. And all the time, at the modern flat, Mrs. Eckman would sit on her steel sofa knitting baby clothes for the Anglican mission, and the great dingy Bible, Mr. Eckman's first deception, would gather dust on its unturned leaf.'  Lord have mercy. This stuff is like fingernails on a chalkboard!   William Golding called Green 'the ultimate twentieth-century chronicler of consciousness and anxiety'. This does not, however, make for entertaining reading. Greene's writing is an examination of the human condition totally devoid of lightness, humor (at least as I understand the word) or romance. His characters are an unpleasant, unhappy bunch.  Ultimately all his writing reveals is the real Graham Greene.  
 I just didn't feel for Willow as i had all the previous characters. The series starts with Willow as a college student, returning home after a tradegy in the family. i won't spoil it, so that's all i can really say. It's the typical set up, except i really wish that the series has started earlier in Willow's life, like all of V.C. Andrews other series. I just didn't get to know Willow, she was boring, and the relationship with Thacther Happened rather quickly in my opinion. I did manage to finish it, so that's why it gets 2 stars 
 I thought it would be really cool to be part of a society that wore red hats in public.  Being part of a club where one could identify another club member because they are wearing a certain item of clothes while in public, fascinates me.  But then I started reading the book.  I found the characters non-believable.  The rules of the club, do overs and make overs were just too restrictive.  Life is not about squashing dialogue with your friends because you are too uncomfortable or too polite to say what is on your mind.  The scene about catching Harold in the act truly stretched my imagination.  The amounts of money thrown around boggled my mind.  And the ending?  It reminded me of the last episode of Seventh Heaven 
 F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life 
 Thirrin is a warrior princess. Now we know what will happen next, in any book where there is a warrior princess there is a war, AND the princess is always pretty green., this book is no exception. Her father dies leaves the country in her hands, it attacked, there is fighting, there is a desperate search for allies to aid the small country. The same old "Young Princess has to Fight Enemy" scheme.  Nothing new to rave about, just major flaws, like them hating the werewolves, them the next day loving them, it entirely consisting of renamed history and mythology. Oh yeah, unless you are writing a story that takes place IN Rome or a part of the world that used Latin in history, YOU DON'T USE LATIN. Parts were also dull, predictable, and just plain boring. Only the main characters had real personality, and even that was lacking. Maybe if it was more original, maybe if it was excuted better, maybe if Hill took some sort of writing class. Don't waste your time, read somthing like Prydain or Narnia instead.        
 Well I hope Christ is nicer to Michael than Ronnie was. Ronnie once famously asked which one is mine when visiting Michael at camp, not knowing which of the boys was his adopted son. Presumably on the day of judgement Christ won't ask Michael "Which one are you?"... I've always cut Michael some slack despite his pandering conservative views and his seemingly insatiable thrist to milk his connection to his father for every last dime he can hustle. And in a way it is refreshing to see Michael still throwing himself at Ronnie's cowboy boots even after his passing. Then again there are still dollars to be made which brings us back to this book. The sob story presented here is not without genuine sobs, but I found it all a tad tragic that here is this abandonded boy still trying to win some acceptance from Dad - be it his earthly one or God - and that his method of winning that acceptance is to live on his knees instead of his own two feet. Hopefully Michael's next volume will be when he finds his own voice and his own manhood. 
 ...nothing is explained with much elegance or in a concise manner.  I used this book for an introductory/applied statistics course.  The authors have a knack for explaining the concepts in the most long winded and roundabout manner possible.  They  are wordy to the extent that it is difficult to follow the progression of specific topics.  Additionally, they have a hard time sepearating examples from the text in the way that future understanding in a section is dependent on reading the examples.  Could be a MUCH better book if it were about a quarter the current length.  I used this for a college class; would be more fit for a high school stat class 
 A few good things, but she's lost her edge AND I find it impossible to identify AT ALL with women who regularly have themselves stitched up here and there, Botoxed, massaged, PT-ed...  Plus I've never made $150,000+ per year so I feel like I live in another cosmos.  Besides, I live in France, where real faces are appreciated.  constance rodrigu 
 If you are expecting more than a dictionary- Don't buy this book. If you are a reenactor, this book is not for you. The book is filled with names of items and dictionary type descriptions. There is very little written text  beyond that. The book seems to be geared more toward the beginning and end  of the 1800's with little regarding the 1850's - 1870 
 the writer is writing the book about himself hoping to have the reader to benefit out of his own history... it is not the case really.  to start with, the language is not good at al. when it comes to chess the writer is like pouring though chunks here and there 
 Hey - I know - first - make a bunch of money and piss a bunch of people off  by spamming the internet. Then make more money selling a book telling others  this is a great idea 
 Here is yet another published response to "Da Vinci Code" which ignores the one exciting idea in the book- the presumption that women, and possibly even relations between women and men, are just as bloomin' divine as single men are.  No wonder that this movie is stirring up animosity in the Church which has consistently sponsored violence toward and mistrust of the feminine. I have yet to see this idea addressed by the Church or the professional "de-bunkers." It would seem that it's much easier to just jump on historical inaccuracies and literary devices and loudly demonstrate how disrespectful they are- that since the author wrote a work of fiction with one stirring idea, that by smearing all the rest of the work the idea will be forgotten. Good try. *sound of weak clapping 
 I can only write about my few years with her - but I certainly have more insight about the woman not so much the singer than this whole dumb book.  Lots about recording - of course he was not there - and nothing about her other than "and then she did".. 
 Blah Blah Blah.  Shut up already.  Read 1/2 the book, just read the predictable ending.  This is BS it wasn't written by Mary Higgins Clark it was written by Mary and Carol Higgins Clark.  What a total load of BS.  If Carol Higgins Clark wants to write, stand on your own two feet. Your mom is in her 70's give her a break. This reminds me of V C Andrewes and the lost novels after her death.  So if something happens to Mary Higgins Clark is Carol going to say she found 15 unfinised novels that she will publish under her mothers name 
   There are many things I enjoyed about this book.  However, I did not find the synthesis of material original or the narrative style compelling.  He opens arguments which are quite debateable, such as implying that the Revolution's impetus was spurred by the energy of the Great Awakening, and then provides no further elaboration or evidence to support his assertion.  In one paragraph he refers to European soldiers as scum and dregs and then bemoans the fate of the aristocratic officer corp who have to rely on beatings and hangings to keep the kidnapped soldiery in line.  This makes Middlekauff sound incredibly dated, prejudiced and unsophisticated.   For a military history read Christopher Ward instead.  
 If an author choses to write a politcally charged novel, there will be bias. What I look for is some balance in the arguments. But, like his brother Rush, David writes with blinders on and misses the obvious contradictions in his arguments. The Democrats are not like Republicans! Of course not. The current Republican party is overwhelmingly an ideological, lock-step plutocratic mob who won't tolerate open discussion of an issue. Democrats on the other hand are diverse, open minded and welcoming of new ideas and thoughts. David Limbaugh would have you believe that is chaos. Open, intelligent discussions are what is missing in the Republican party right now.  A book does not have to be well written to put across the author's theme, and the ideas he is promoting, but when it is dully written, poorly researched and obvious in its misinterpretation of issues and situations it is difficult to give it much credence.  Basically I have read this book before, several times. There is nothing new, in fact it sounds like a few days of Rush on the radio, usually wrong and overwhelmingly insulting to anyone who can think for themself.  So, all I see here is an poorly written dull diatribe of the same old propaganda from the right - "Don't confuse us with the facts we already have been told what to think." 
 Who published these weak translations?  Yup, they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately.  How about using real paper?  B&N needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality 
 This is the kind of translation exercise you get in this book. Other reviewers have commented on the stilted language and subject matter, both in English and Arabic. How about, "I have seen many spiders. The beys' and pashas' rooms must be swept afresh," or "Follow the well-known plan and put the olives in the barrels."  These are not sentences from 1965, the date of the first edition, but from the British mandate.    If you want to learn Arabic, you need to use a text book, not a grammar book. There are lots of good ones available, and there are lots of grammar books available with more authentic examples 
 You can't have fear and faith at the same time. Wake up 
 Susan Pulaski is a royal mess.  Recently widowed and alcoholic, the Las Vegas Police Department relieved her and the city of her duties as a police psychologist.  After all, the dear lady had enough klinkers in her thinker that had to be hammered out first.  A psychotic serial killer is on the loose and it takes a person with savantism, an extremely rare form of autism to help Ms. Pulaski "get into the mind of the killer" and anticipate the killer's next move.  I for one am quite sick of stories that portray autistics as being savants.  Since savantism affects less than 10% of the autistic population, it is sadly ironic that it has become such a stereotype.  As for the autistic character, being the child of Ms. Pulaski's former boss didn't hurt either.  All in all, a ridiculous, implausible tale replete with cliches and stereotypes.  Please retire this entire cast and bring Ben back!  
 I was hoping to hear the rockin' spanish flavor of the Robert Rodriguez band Chingon, but what the hell is this?!!!   The Amazon recomendations lead me to this album, and hinde sight I should have read a little more before buying, but I was too excited to hear more of the Rodriguez Chingon. I hope this helps you 
 I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope.  This was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over: Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something = All is well.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Boring, VERY boring. I never once flet any real tension except for the initial "problem" which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in the end.    The problem is that all of the "issues" the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly.  Rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be OK.  I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?  Nothing really happened.  It was not emotional at all since the "struggles" of the men were so poorly portrayed.  To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks!  The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again, this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be meaningful.  I will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects.  Too bad, I had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored.  NOT recommended 
 The advice for exercising and breastfeeding is wrong. It says breastfeeding hurts. It is out of date. It quotes that study that purported to show that exercise made milk taste bad/be less good for babies, and then recommends a complicated regimen not feeding that milk to your baby. It treats formula feeding as a reasonable strategy, despite how dangerous formula is for babies. It urges very tight, compressive, supportive exercise bras for breastfeeding mamas, and does not allow for the probability that might lead to plugged ducts/mastitis in many women.  The duck squat line drawing is laughable. In addition to not showing a form of the squat that would allow for a pregnant belly, it shows a woman in a very deep squat, with feet flat on the floor, not leaning forward and not holding onto anything or supported at her back. Physics sezs: Not Possible!  Overall: mostly useless, pretty dull, unhelpful if you exercise out of doors by engaging in interesting activities. Get Aneema Van Groenou's book instead 
 Nothing in this book was usable for me.  Okay, very little.  If I was trying to write the next _Ethan Frome_, then this book would be perfect.  Instead I write sci-fi and fantasy.  I was looking for tips to improve my description of things; this book recommends describing different things.  Too much emphasis on metaphor (which is a wonderful tool but a tad obvious).  If you want to write in a way people might actually communicate, this book might be a waste of your time.  HOWEVER, poets and pure-literary writers might find it more useful than I did 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 ...but every song on the album sounds the same. And I happen to like them. Disappointed 
 I just finished reading "Seven Years to Seven Figures: The Fast-Track Plan to Becoming a Millionaire." The book's framework consists of 8 success stories from people who have reached 7 figures in 7 yeasr or less. And from the stories, you're supposed to take away lessons that will help you accomplish the same. Although it only took me 2 days to read the book, I can save you even more time. Just read the "AFTERWORD" section, which is only 5 pages, and you have everything in the book you're supposed to learn. It's a succinct summary of the whole book.  There's nothing new here, no great insight. How to become wealthy? Make a plan, work hard, and follow through. How to become wealthy quickly? Either get a high income job or start your own business AND invest in real estate. THAT, is the gist of the book right there.  Another thing that bothered me about the book is the author's constant promotion of his company and related products. The whole book is one long sales letter advertising his e-zine company and info products & programs disguised as a book. The 8 success stories are akin to the "testimonials" you see online everyday touting info products, with one of the success stories actually going into detail about a copywriting program the author's company regularly promotes. (I know this because I am a subscriber to his free e-zine.)  I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the motivation for writing this book was undertaken purely to increase the author's wealth and popularity by putting the proceeds of sales in THEIR bank accounts. This book was definitely more fluff than substance. Save your money 
 I have a habit of wiping the edge of my wine glass during dinner.  When I wiped one of these with the edge of a soft napkin, the glass broke 
 Adults would never choose to read this garbage. It would be seen as masochistic [...] and too depressing to bother with. Raise an animal, get attached to it, but the reality of farm life is that if it can't successfully breed, you personally will have to butcher it. Heck, why should your dad do it for you, when we can reinforce that valuable childhood lesson of "Life sucks and then you die"?  What is the real point of this book? Do teachers everywhere get a vicarious thrill at the horror kids must experience when reading this stuff? My kid asked me to read it aloud to him when he couldn't take it anymore, and I got to the point where I hurled it across the room. Between this and all the other depressing books we make kids read, are we surprised when they are cynical goths?  AVOID THIS BOOK, if you love your kids 
 The biggest dissapointment I had with getting this book is that I purchased the Microsoft Reader Version.  One is led to believe that one can highlight, cut and paste, etc., by using this new tool for reading.  Actually, all you get is electronic pages that are inert.  They cannot be printed, one cannot cut and paste from them, all one can do is stare at them on the screen.  In order to transfer the print from screen to one's computer, one must first copy (by hand) the print, re-type it on screen into another program, then save.  In other words, the e-version, for the researcher is not only ABSOLUTELY USELESS, it DOUBLES THE AMOUNT OF WORK ONE MUST DO TO EXCERPT MATERIAL FROM A BOOK. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF PERSON MICROSOFT HAD IN MIND WHEN THEY CREATED THIS INFLEXIBLE PRODUCT.  IT IS CERTAINLY A DISASTER FOR ME, AND I INTEND TO REQUEST A REFUND ON MY "DIGITAL PURCHASE" SINCE ALL I PURCHASED WAS AN INERT, DOUBLE-THE-WORK TO READ AND EXCERPT BOOK.  WHAT A DISASTER!  WHAT AN UNMITIGATED DISASTER.  IT SORT OF MAKES ONE WONDER WHY THEY EVEN WENT TO THE TROUBLE TO CREATE THIS PRODUCT.  
 The soundtrack does not match the film you are seeing, and it is really irritating. (It's off by a few seconds.) I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more had it been in synch 
 This is a very famous book, and so I looked forward to reading it with a lot of hope that it would help my game.  I found it to be pretty close to useless, and would certainly never recommend it to anyone.  It does, however, do a good job of exalting Harvey Penick, which may have been his purpose in publishing it 
 Suggest for all genuinely interested in this topic , to refer to Rabbi David Berger's book , The Rebbe , the Messiah & the Scandal of Orthodox indifference  
 I recently purchased this item along with a Sony ICF-M410V radio for which it is listed by Sony as an accessory.  Don't buy this item for use with any radio, Sony or other, as it produces static at lower frequencies and a steady signal-obliterating loud hum at higher frequencies. When I called Sony about this, the person with whom I spoke indicated an awareness of the problem.  The recommended adaptor is an AC-E45HG, but it is not available in the US!  It is listed on the Sony Style Canada site, but they will not ship to the US.  Catch 22 completed 
 Don't buy this book. The Magic Lantern Guide, late though it is, is a much more comprehensive book.  The book's title is misleading. It's not a "field guide." A field guide would be a book dedicated to fully categorizing and explaining each of the camera's operating modes, controls and menu selections. This book simply regurgitates what's in the manufacturer's manual and then goes to boilerplate on how to make better photos. The things unique to the Nikon D200 are largely done by page 72. The remaining 178 pages is largely a generic digital photography volume.  All of the current DSLR cameras are amazingly feature-rich. They have complex architecture and much hidden capability. They also have capabilities that can actually get in the way if not properly understood and they have gee-whiz features that are most often best left alone. The manual that comes in the box explains each feature as if that feature were co-equal in importance with every other feature.  The fact is, some of the camera's feautures are very important. Some are less so. And which ones often depend on the type of photography being done. A good book on this camera would offer real-world explanations and advice with respect to the long list of capabilities represented by this camera.  The reality is that there is little to be gained from this book that is not available from the camera manual and from the photography books that you probably already own 
 While the author states that she is writting a cross platform book, she ofter fails to explain the correct way of doing things on the Windows platform. The Windows user is left to figure it out on their own. The Windows user may find another title more suitable 
   What's very sad is not only are there children out there who believe that they are some how Xtra special saviors of the universe but seemigly educated adults who haven't moved past the fairy tales of Alice in Wonderland.  Remember, we are asked to sniff the flowers but not to eat them.  Adults who engage in channeling, speak of chakras, describe past lives and fret about some 5th dimension after the year 2012 are one pill short of their medication.  If you have children who behave strangely you have only to look at your own fears and delusions 
 Too general to be useful.  Too trite to be tolerated.  I read the whole thing in about an hour, and realized it was geared mostly to non-fiction writers, held dubious advice about calling editors directly (against a mountain of evidence to the contrary about how much editors do not want to receive phone calls), and was really only a superficial glossing over the topic.  The 'Sell-Your-Novel Toolkit' by Elizabeth Lyon seems more helpful 
 It's tempting to spoil the end of this novel in order to describe how BAD it truly is, but Ms. Grafton has somehow earned a following, and as I've said before, there is something for everyone out there. After all, some people (not a majority) actually voted for George W. Bush, on purpose! I think this level of mystery fluff is for them.  Rather than spoil the nutty climax (I have worked in hospitals for years, so I ain't buying it) I will mention that the second paragraph of this schlock novel closes with the words: "...life is one big, savage joke; not funny ha-ha, but cruel like those gags sixth graders have been telling since the world began."  I became so distracted thinking about people who were already in sixth grade when the world began (where did they go to kindergarten?) that I almost missed the rest of the chapter 
 I read the authors book: THE UNAUTHORIZED VERSION and found it to be well written and enlightening.  When I read the book: PAGANS AND CHRISTIANS I found it to be incomprehensible and dull.  After reading 170 pages I gave up in frustration.  A year later I tried to read it again and got to page 180, before I gave up.  Then I decided to go to the second section on Christianity to see if it improved, but it was as meandering and frustrating as the first part 
 You will regret this purchase. Unless, of course, you do not mind re-adjusting the poles and pulling it upright for your child every 3 minutes!  However, if your child will continually sit still inside and never touch the teepee itself, then this is the toy for you! In my opinion, this item was a complete waste of money.  The poles do not stay in place properly when children move about inside. I was constantly having to fix it so it would stand upright for the kids. Not at all durable.  Had it up for less than a week when a pole broke. The material also ripped easily. Wasn't even worth giving to the Goodwill.  It now takes up space in some landfill.  Thought it would be cute for my little boy's cowboy themed room.  Too bad, what a waste 
 This is a book laden with the falsely technical jargon of theory. There may be worthwhile ideas here hidden beneath layers of obscurantist prose, but the game did not seem worth the candle 
 I was hoping this book would be a collection of monologues for women from plays that directors might have heard of! It appears they are written by the author and most are not appropriate for a serious audition. Feel like I wasted my money here. 
 The author of this book was obviously not applying "emotional intelligence" principles when writing this book.  The points were all there and really proved why emtional intelligence is important, but it was just not done in a good manner.  I do not typically shy away from long books, but this one was impossible.  It was assigned to me and about 30 other people in my organization (we were to discuss and present ideas found inside the book), and can I tell you that no one finished it because of repetitious and dreadful writing?  Just know that to be successful, you HAVE to exhibit emotional intelligence and be a intuitive, kind and generally good person to work with. If you don't believe me, save yourself the time/energy and buy the Cliffs notes 
 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  "Maîtresse" or "Mistress" in my opinion, is one of the worst three films to be released on the Criterion Collection. The only reason I watched and reviewed it is because it was released by Criterion. The film contains very explicit depictions of sadomasochistic activity some of which involve nailing body parts to blocks of wood. There is also a graphic scene of a horse being slaughtered for meat as well as numerous scenes of people eating horsemeat that horse lovers may be highly offended by. It got an X-rating by the MPAA and was banned in many parts of the US.   The film is about a woman who secretly operates a sex dungeon in her basement. When her apartment is broken into, the burglar falls in love with her.  The only special feature on the DVD is an interview with the film's director, Barbet Schroeder 
 Peter Krass's biography of Andrew Carnegie is very well-written; he recounts the waypoints of Carnegie's life: his humble origins in Scotland, his jobs as a telegraph clerk, railroad executive, and steel magnate in the US, and his ultimate metamorphosis into a noted philanthropist and apostle for peace.  When you first read this book, you really feel as if you are reading a good book.  It's not until you start thinking about the claims Krass makes and the lessons you think you have learned, that you realize it has gigantic holes.    My problem with this book is that Krass makes claims which are dubious, and doesn't furnish credible historical sources to substantiate his less flattering allegations.  He doesn't do justice to the reality that Carnegie lived in a different time, nor does he seem to understand the dilemnas that Carnegie faced.  Some examples: In the 1870s, the railroad industry was growing by leaps and bounds.  When Carnegie won contracts to supply his own railroad-employer, he was one of the few people that the railroad's management knew to be capable, loyal as far as trade secrets were concerned, and to have something to lose (his job,) if problems arose later.  Today this would be self-dealing and cronyism; back then, it happened all the time and sometimes was practically the only way to get the job done.  By not putting this into the proper historical context, Krass makes Carnegie appear in a false light.  Similarly in the 1870s-1900s, the money supply and US economy oscillated between boom and bust. In bad times, when the sales of rails dropped by 85%, Carnegie had no choice but to lower wages at his mills, which Krass bemoans.    Krass' book is full of hints that Carnegie was an abusive employer.  This is possible, but I wished he had provided wage data for Carnegie's employees, as well as for workers in the area and in comparable trades, so as to leave the reader in no doubt.  Krass complains that Carnegie had his workers work either 56 hours a week in good times, and 84 in bad times, but Krass doesn't mention that many farmers worked hours at least as long.  How was Carnegie able to find employees for decades if he was a slave-driver?  Krass makes much of the accidents that occurred in Carnegie's steel mills, and mentions that "Captain" Jones a plant manager who enjoyed both Carnegie's and the employees' trust and admiration, died in such a mishap.  Jones was so close to both that when Carnegie offered Jones an equity stake in the company, he declined, lest the workers felt he had "sold out;" at this Carnegie paid Jones the salary of the President of the United States.  I find it impossible to believe that a man of Jones' caliber would have needlessly risked his life amidst unnecessarily unsafe machinery.    A serious historian won't discuss the safety records in those plants without mentioning other harsh facts of life in those days; the average life expectancy was in the order of 37 years, and the jobs in the mills ultimately allowed the workers to provide their families with sanitation and other amenities that substantially reduced infant, child, and adult mortality.  I can't say whether families were better off having their breadwinner work in workplaces that would be unacceptable by today's standards so that they could get out of unsanitary conditions that would be unacceptable by today's standards.  But I can say that Krass, by ignoring that these trade-offs existed, and simply flinging mud, writes anti-history.  One of Krass' "facts" is seriously wrong; no serious historian denies that the "Black Hand" was close to - perhaps even run by - influential circles in the Serbian army, but Krass does.  Krass writes that the Habsburgs were intent on plunging Europe into war by insisting on an outside investigation of Price Ferdinand's assasination, but doesn't explain how the Habsburgs could have let those who masterminded the murder of their crown prince go unpunished.  This makes me question to what extent Krass understands Carnegie's diplomatic efforts.  This is not at all to imply that Carnegie was beyond chicanery and reproach, but rather that Krass doesn't make a persuasive case.  The pity is that by consulting with competent economists, business historians, and management experts, Krass could have written a phenomenal book that would have inspired its readers, and many business students.  Carnegie and his steel company was the google or microsoft of its day, and yet Krass has written and book that leaves a reader more befuddled at the end of the book than at the beginning 
 Of course Stossel can talk big about busting them "liberals" but his book makes no sense about it because he admits that he never intended to bust them but instead join them. Ever wonder why ABC hires such kooks while rejecting talented youths? Ever wonder why Stossel says that the best way to punish them elites is to give them more tax breaks? This and his other book make even horse manure smell not as bad  
 No great revelations here -- wasn't expecting much anyway with the always dull Peter Golenbock as ghost writer.  Too bad too, Damon's story as a fascinating Thai/American elite athlete could have been penned as a compelling one.  Was looking for even a minor crescendo during the improbable 2004 ALCS comeback against the Bronx Bombers but nothing really ever ultimately gelled.  The book could have vastly improved from better identification of dates and times and avoidance of extensive rehashing of prior events with no added detail.  Saved from one star hell by the inclusion of a pretty good photos section.  As if the poor writing wasn't enough, idiot mistakes abound, from misspelling the names of numerous major leaguers (Scott Sauerbeck as Scott Sauerbach, Bucky Jacobsen as Bucky Jacobson) to basic errors in game details.  You'd think Golenbock would be improving as a writer after his many collaborations with other sports figures.  Damon either exerted too much editorial control, or, more likely, it's time for Golenbock to hang up his spikes.. 
 I bought this by mistake, thinking it was a full book by Katie Macalister, I tried to read the rest but it was just horrible.  
 UGH!  These books are horrible!  Their popularity seems to stem from their quality of reading like stories, which is just what they are- stories!  The historical inaccuracy is embarrassing.  I enrolled my daughter in K12 homeschool program, and quickly withdrew her when I learned that they are using this series to teach American History.  What were the publishers thinking when they promoted this tripe?  I feel very strongly that this series is not worth the paper on which it is written 
 Before you buy this book cut/paste the following words into a Google search:  "Hank Hanegraaff" financial  Then come back to this review.  It makes me weap to see Christian ministries misuse God's money. My advice?  If you really MUST read this book, buy it USED so the money goes to a struggling book seller.

 This book goes on my list of the worst books I have ever read.  It took me 3 tries and a five days to get through the introduction. I had to read it for my Ap US History class, and sure, it was very educational. (I have a test on it tomorrow, so let's see how much I retained) It just took FOREVER!  I spend 7 days locked in my room while on vacation in the beautiful Smokey Mountains. Those 5 days it took me to read the intro are not included. I read all day every day and it bored me to death.  I constantly drifted off and fell asleep reading it four out of those 7 days.  I liked the last chapter... because it was the last. 
 This is the worst work out tape i've ever purchased...its a waste of money...there is nothing latin about this tape..and her moves are so repetitive...u won't even work up a sweat However the viva latin rhythm work out was excellent...highly recomende 
 This is one of the more disappointing releases from the indy hip-hop label Rhymesayers. I found next to nothing fresh about this release. RJD2, whom I usually love, comes with some of his weakest, and least colorful production efforts to date. Did he make these in a weekend? He was probably too busy supplying his flyest beats to veteran rapper Aceyalone for his new (and superior) album ("Magnificent City" [2006]). The production work is incomparable. The beats aren't terrible, but they're far from fantastic. Perhaps RJ was lacking spirit due to Blueprint's redundant set of boring lyrics. Blueprint sort of sound's like a hypocrite on "No Gimmicks". Because later he dives into subjects like his ladies wasting his cell phone minutes ("I Need My Minutes"), the ridiculous "Blame It On The Jager", and other mind-numbing fluff (no gimmicks...riiight).  Blueprint has got to stick to his story rhymes, which he excels at. His battle skills are obviously terrible (pick up some old Scribble Jam videos to see exactly what I mean). The first Soul Position album was fairly good (mostly due to RJD2's very fresh production), but "Things Go Better with RJ and Al" falls flat on it's face. These guys have got to head back down to the basement and stir up the creative juices (Slug should probably join the party too), because it obviously isn't working out to well this time around 
 Although not nearly as heinous as Richard Avedon's "In the American West", Stephen Shore's "Uncommon Places" earns an honored place in the annals of overrated art. Its sole interest is its time-capsule appeal.  Imagine if you will, taking a camera across America and shooting ugly buildings, roads, humble homes, and desolate scenery with nary a concern of cohesiveness or narrative. Make no attempt to include a theme, other than perhaps a New Yorker's condescension much like the lyrics in the Talking Heads song "The Big Country." You then have this book.   Perhaps 15-20 of these photgraphs hold some genuine magic. The rest are totally ridiculous. Much better is Eggleston's "Los Alamos."   Even the title is grating 
 I bought the book thinking it would be a practical introduction on how to apply CMMI to your company hence I was very disappointed to find out the authors have limited themselves only to summarize the CMMI models. Few real explication is given about concepts within the CMMI models, neither any real life experience is shared that could help you implement CMMI 
 I basically agree with the reviewer who said this book is largely an "info-mercial", BUT the PsychK course itself is something I would recommend.  It is a simple & safe way to change belief systems, without the arduous (& often ineffective) methods of talk therapy.  The DVD Psychology of Change demonstrates one PsychK balancing technique and it's possible, as another reviewer indicated, that it may work for you, but the PsychK Workshop will provide other methods to use when that one does NOT work, as well as other practical information.  Skip the book & go to the Workshop 
 Despite all the negative publicity, and my insistence that I wouldn't buy anymore of these books, I did.  My new rule ended up being that I would wait for the paperbacks.    So with Book 11 due in PB this fall, I decided to give this book another try.  You see, a couple years ago when it came out in paperback, I tried to read it.  I couldn't.  My friends told me just to read the last chapter and skip the rest.  I started reading anyway.  I put it down.  It is so boring; filled with so many people who I've never heard of, and lacking the best elements of the series (Rand v. Forsaken), that I couldn't do it.  Well, here I am again.  And I still can't read it.  And now I hear that Book 12 will end the entire series?  So we have a great first 5-6 books where tons of cool thing occur, a terrible next 4-5 books where nothing occurs, and then an ending where everything stops?  Just like that?  I now recommend that people read the first three books in the series and no more.  TDR is a good stopping place, although there's good stuff in books 4-5, they require a reader to want more.  Book 3 wraps it nicely.  Just pretend Ishamael was the Dark One, and you're all done.  What a tragedy to have created something so great and ruined it so thoroughly 
 The format of this book is interesting -- a collection of essays by people who might have nothing else in common besides being in this book.  In that, you read about a diverse group of topics by people who hold diverse opinions.  Unfortunately, they also have a diversity of credibility.  I found some lapses in essays on topics I know a bit about, so it made me wonder what lapses there were in essays on topics I knew little about.  The result was I found it hard to fully believe anything in the book.  For example, an essay by Arianna Huffington on how evil drug companies are and how they're in cahoots with FDA to get their drugs approved was laughable.  She cited no references to back up her assertions.  FDA analyzes the data submitted and only then sees if the conclusion they come up with on their own matches the conclusion of the company.  They cannot be pushed around by anyone.  And while it's true that some drugs that have been marketed have later been recalled for safety issues, it's awfully hard to identify rare adverse effects in the limited numbers of patients that go through clinical trials.  Much later in the book, the editor has a short essay on a compound that he claims cures cancer.  His evidence is based on test-tube assays and some anecdotal data in animals.  Oh, and it's a natural herbal product used in Chinese medicine for centuries.  His gripe?  That FDA (the same one so easily pushed around, according to Ms Huffington) won't let sellers of this herb put the anti-cancer claim on the label.  Well, FDA likes to see well-controlled, prospective trials that demonstrate a drug (or substance) is safe and effective.  They don't accept the "a billion Chinese people can't be wrong" argument, unfortunately.  They also need to inspect your manufacturing plant and to see your methods of producing the herb so that they can ensure the product is consistent.  If a company doesn't want to go through that cost and effort for an herb they can't patent, well, that's their decision, but FDA can't let them make a claim they haven't proven.  And a final example is the essay on veganism.  The author is clearly very passionate about living a life free of animal products or exploitation of animals in any other way.  However, his argument might have been more compelling if the literature he cited were from sources other than animal rights writings.  Furthermore, he makes a couple of errors:  he claims that humans cannot manufacture vitamin D (we do, in sunlight, of course), and he neglects to mention the problem of vitamin B12, stating that we can get all we need from plant material.  There is no vitamin B12 in plants at all, so vegans need to get it from somewhere.  Most supplements come from an animal source, so unless vegans eat lots of yeast extract, they're kind of stuck.  Nonetheless, the book does provide a lot of viewpoints and information you would certainly not read in the newspaper or hear on the nightly news.  So read it, but remain connected to your inner skeptic 
 The book was supposed to be "like new" and i came all bent up on all corners and there was a coffee stain inside one front cover and on the first couple of pages. This book has question and answer sections and you need a special paper to see the answers and this guy didnt even put it in there so basically the book is worthless to me. I am not happy at all and you wont be either 
 Overall, too much emphasis on Goldfarb, and not enough on Kennedy.  The description of his work in Newport is somewhat dull.  However, his thoughts at the end about the JFK assassination connection with organized crime are interesting 
 Of all the hateful self-centered characters and idiotic plot lines in this movie, the one I found most offensive was the one involving Emilio Estevez/Andie MacDowell.  Isn't stalking hilarious?  And isn't Kirby the cutest obsessed stalker you've ever seen?  I bet stalking victims everywhere wish their stalker was a lovable as little Kirby.  I also loved at the end when Ally Sheedy tells Andrew McCarthy and Judd Nelson that she just wants them "all to be friends".  To which they both reply the classic cinema line, "Ehhhh... ok."  Wow.  Now that's drama. 
 This is my favorite production of the ALICE books.  I love the sets, songs, and casting. It's also very British, which I think adds another great element to the mix.  However, skip this DVD edition.  I got it, excited to see ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND in widescreen and, perhaps a better print than what's previously been available.  No such luck.  The DVD appears to be struck from the same crappy VHS version that's been out there for ages.  Faded colors. Pan-and-scan. In this age of DVD, quality like this is such a shame 
 Wouldn't you think that the manufacturers of a wine rack would measure the bottles of wine before designing the rack ?   Apparently not, in this case. After purchasing 3 of these racks, I discovered that about 10% of my 200 bottle collection doesn't fit in the grid holes. It was understood that magnums weren't going to fit, which was no big deal. But when over 20 bottles end up sitting on the floor because they are about 1/8" to 1/4" too large in diameter I get a little irritated, especially after paying over $300 including shipping. The overall quality of the product is average.  The racks were not straight along their length and had to be tie-wired together to keep them in alignment. 
 Sorry, I thought this would be a great updated version of the classic SHR music - and I was really disappointed. I don't really understand the point of this album - why "remake" music that was timeless and pretty much perfect in the first place?  I can't imagine my own kids actually learning anything from these remakes (and bottom line, wasn't that the point?)... and listening to "No More Kings" was downright depressing - when SHR has always had the exact-opposite effect! 
 What happened George Acosta? What happened to that feeling that was in Awake? People saying that this is the best Trance album of 2005 are full of it. And saying that Black Onyx is the best track on here? Ha! That has to be the worst track on here! This track has no melody...just an UGLY repetitive synth that's more annoying than pleasing. Nothing was memorable in this CD...just a bunch of boring anthems that are easily forgettable. Not even the classic "Born Slippy" could save this. Although this album isn't terrible...it is defintely NOT the best Trance album of 2005  Please...do not listen to these reviewers...they are only trying to trick you into buying this mediocre album or they just have bad taste in Trance music 
 I wish this book was written better. You could tell that it was her very first time trying to write a story. I kept waiting for something to happen yet I feel like she was whining the whole tme 
 I loved FoW's first album.  It was from start to finish a lesson on how good pop can be when people do it right.  Tons of great, British Invasion style hooks supporting some of the best melodies I've heard in years.  Every album of their's since hasn't been as good as their wonderful debut but at least they have always had some truly great songs on each album.  "Utopia Parkway" had (among other songs) "Red Dragon Tatoo" and "Welcome Interstate Managers" had some fantastic ballads and a shockingly good country song.  Even their extensive B-sides comp had some great songs on it.    Sadly, the best songs on this album are worse than all their other highlights.  I hate to say it, but this album is their very worst to date.  I don't want to spend a lot of time on a negative review, but I have three big gripes with this album, so I'll just fire them off right away:  1.)Synths.  Why are they playing synths on this thing?  I thought they were considered power-pop, play some dang guitars!  2.)The music and melodies are exceptionally weak compared to their previous work.  Aside from the first two tracks, nothing sticks as good as most of their work.  These guys have an excellent gift for crafting very catchy, enjoyable pop music.  But they don't have it on the vast majority of this album.  A lot of it is as bad or worse than the stuff on their B-sides comp.  You know its a weak album when your follow up to a B-sides comp is not as good as the B-sides comp.  The musicianship just reeks of bad choices.  I already touched on the synths, but the dance beat on "Somebody To Love?"  The horns and the vocal filtering on "Strapped For Cash?"  C'mon guys, you know how to make better musical choices than this.  3.)  (Most of) The songs are horrible.  I think the main problem is they've started doing character writing instead of songs in the first person.  Plenty of artists do that, they tell stories about characters they make up instead of writing about themselves.  Thats fine.  The problem is that this album is filled with the most boring characters I've ever seen.  The biggest offender in my eyes is "Micheal And Heather At The Baggage Claim" which is about a couple waiting for and then not being able to find their bags.  So they go home.  Thats the whole song.  Wow.  Great story, right?  I don't know about you all, but I just LOVE hearing songs about the small petty annoyances of everyday life.  You couple it with the fact that the songs hook is wordless ("ba pa pa paaa") and not that catchy and you have a terrible song.  The worst part is that, after the first two tracks, they're pretty much all like that.  The music is just as dull.  You're left with a bunch of tired, boring songs about tired, boring people.  Its not funny or cute or catchy (three qualities that described a LOT of their previous work), its just dull.  I don't know what happened to these guys, but I really get the feeling that they don't want to do this anymore because this whole album has that sleepy, by-the-numbers quality to it.  It feels like they're just not trying that hard anymore.  I don't know.  Maybe they need a change of style.  Heck, they managed to toss together three good, old-school country songs across their last couple of releases, maybe they should put out a traditional country album and show they retards on country radio how its done.  No... thats probably a horrible idea, but it's obvious to me that they're tiring of the pop game.  Its sad to see, since Fountains of Wayne used to be a very good band.  If you've never heard of these guys before, start at their first album, but do NOT get this one.  Its not worth your time.  And if you're a super fan who just has to have it, enter with lowered expectations 
 This book provided a method to gather requirement efficiently but the rest of the method should be revised 
 The worst story is Kenyon !!! I will NOT buy any more in the future!! 
 This is a dishonest book.  The authors claim to have invented a `diversity measure' for each place, giving the percent odds the next person you meet on the street will be of a different ethnic origin than your own.  They peg the U.S. average at 54 percent.  They say, ". . . diversity makes a place a better place to live," and that it "brings value in differing points of view, differing interests, and different cultures to learn from."  Now for this book's dirty little secret: By their own figures, almost all of the 100 places they feature are less diverse than America.    You can't have it both ways.  If you're going to piously celebrate diversity, stop steering readers away from diverse Dallas or Charlotte or Chattanooga to lily-white Flower Mound, Matthews, or Hixson 
 This book is sparse on substance. Most of it is is filler. I have net to find anything that is a useful. A subhead on page 17 sums it up "It's Psychology, Not Just Technology!". Almost no technology, in this case. I was looking for discussion of unnecesary speed sapping processes that sometimes get going on under OSX. The book doesn't even mention processes.    
 Don't get me wrong. I'm a raging hippie, who's completely anti-war. And the lyrics on this album are great, and I love the cover of "Imagine" by John Lennon. But it seems that the actual desire to make good *music* fell to the back burner on this one. It's not that the songs are bad per se, but they're all fillers. It's an entire album of fillers, with no really great songs to bring them up. Overall, a disappointment, which is unfortunate, since the wonderful message is lost by the lack of lustre in the music.   If you're new to A Perfect Circle, pick one of the other albums. If you're a veteran, sure, pick it up. But I'd suggest listening to it on random with your other A Perfect Circle and Tool cd's 
 I own this dictionary.  I've opened it a few times, but never found occasion to use it, because it's not very good, and I will explain.  For someone who wants to learn kanji one at a time, it isn't much use because the characters are ordered by radical, which is a completely ineffective order for learning the kanji.  Instead, I would recommend Essential Kanji by P.G. O'Neill, which has the kanji arranged in order of usefulness, or Remembering the Kanji, Volume I, by James Heisig which is a complete course in learning all 1945 Jouyou Kanji that a diligent student can complete in 3 months or less.  For someone who wants a kanji reference, this book is also fairly useless.  It has 1006 kanji, which just isn't enough.  Only elementary school texts constrain them to the set of educational kanji, so if you try to read anything real, you'll find that every other character you try to look up won't be in this dictionary.  Essential Kanji (see above) has 2000 kanji, which will encompass most of what you need to look up, and it's about the same size, and costs less.  The two good points about this book is its extensive lists of compounds, and that its organization by radical makes it quick and easy to look up kanji, but if it doesn't have the one you're looking for, what good is it?  The good does not outweigh the bad 
 I borrowed this DVD from my local library, I was taken a back with the quality of this DVD, it looks like a crap video that is a shambles, The audio is reasonable in 5.1 plus the Doco is just ok, but the concert must be the worst vision I have seen on a DVD, How can David Bowie be happy with this visual display of inferior quality?, I get cheesed off with having good AV gear to have to  run this type of crap, and that's what it is, CRAP!! I have videos that come up 100% better, Why produce DVDs that dont qualify for this technology? it"s not the first and it won't be the last, DVD producers please don't bother putting visual crap out on DVD, your transfers are unworthy of modern technology, if the Masters don't scrub up for transfer forget it, although a lot of people cant see any difference, so be it.  
 I am a big fan of Cassandra Wilson and was duped into buying this disc after reading reviews here and elsewhere. I knew after the first 3 songs that trouble was brewing as they all sounded alike. Indeed, the entire thing suffers from the same muddy mix and monotone vocals. What a waste. No diversity in song selection and no vocal range. She should lose T-Bone Burnett for her next effort. *Note* She has displayed this same poor judgment in concert with her song list 
 I bought 12 of these 4 years ago.. for use exclusively in mole chaser devices (slow continuous drain).  Was recently surprised that they've started to lose charge within days, and even fail to charge (in the accu charger).. not quite the "charge over a 1000 times" I was sold on. Over the four years, I had to recharge them every about once a month.. which works out to 48 times before they gave up the ghost. Was about to buy more of these things, until reading the other reviews and seeing the other hi-end rechargeables (ie MAHA).  Not sure what I'll do next 
 This is by far the worst dance movie I have ever watched. The characters, acting and plot lines are laughable (even for someone who usually loves cheesy dance movies) and what little dancing there is in the film is badly filmed and boring.  If it hadn't been for the hilarious 80's outfits and hairdos (especially the curly mullet sported by the lead character), I would have turned it off. If you like salsa, watch 'Dance With Me' 
 The work in this book is tectonically wacked 
 If youre looking for an arabic or otherwise unique name DON'T bother buying this book!  Firstly the prounciation of the names is not shown, secondly the meanings for many are not accurate, thirdly the book is laid out as a list - which I thought would be good however with all these names I'd rather have a more organised way of sorting through them other than alphbetically. Finally there are plenty of baby names it calls "names" which are simply words translated. For example one name, arabic "Kilab" translation DOG. Who in there right mind would call there kid dog?! I'm only suprised it doesnt say english name "Dog" translation dog, what a great name?!  Also the word Kafir is there and is being called a name, in the arabic tradition (and I suspect in all religious traditions) no one would ever call the child by this name as it means "unbeliever" ie someone who does not believe in God - and it is not a name nor has it ever in the history of the arabic language been used as a name. I would also like to add the book often repeats names as new but they are simply spelt dyfffarantlly and have strange pronounciations. I feel bad for those people who take this books word for meaning and prounciation for any other traditions except english! Those looking for a unique name treat this book with extreme caution 
 This is one of my favorite authors.  I could hardly wait to open Burning Bright and get lost in London of the 1700's.  Well, lost I got!  Each page was more and more boring.  I read 3/4th of the book and donated it to the library.  After reading the other reviews I am glad I didnt finish the book and be completely disappointed with the weak ending.  
 I am a Trevanian maniac. I buy every used copy of Shibumi I can find, just in case the world ends and I am left to wander the rubble with no chance of a new edition of Shibumi. get it? I love Trevanian. This new book? More closely resembled something my cat coughed up than Shibumi. Reading this new one, I was praying for the end of the world, just so I didn't have to finish the book. I finally tossed it aside after three hundred pages. Look, I understand that Trevanian prides himself on being a master of every  genre. Maybe I was the only one who loved Incident at Twenty Mile. But I found this new book to be boring, trite, petty, and poorly written, and it gets one star because, as a Trevanian diehard, I have no choice 
 I did not like the first book at all and not sure why I read the second, I guess that I am just stubborn that way.  I really enjoyed the concept of following Robert the Bruce through his consolidation of power.  The Scottish Monarchy is a fascinating story and one in which I have ordered a history book about to read the whole story.  What I didn't like about this book was that the battle between good and evil was too simplistic.  When situations got bad for Bruce or the Templars there was no real action or plot to save them, the Templars just prayed about it and some divine intervention would take care of the problem. I simply didn't like the fact that it was that easy.  I guess that I was looking for more drama or action from the divine forces.  A demon in rings doing mans bidding in a war against the Templars (I would have thought the church as a whole would have been a better target for this concept).  The Templar order falling apart from within was interesting and maybe I don't know enough about their real history to appreciate their treatment in this work.  This was not my favorite piece of historical fiction 
 If you have an older 3 year old or young 4 year old who needs potty training this is a good sticker pack.  The stickers have phrases on them, like; wiped by myself, remembered to wash hands, was dry, etc.  If you have a younger potty trainer, save your money and buy some smiley face stickers, or character themed stickers your child will enjoy placing on a potty chart. Toys-R-Us carries cartoon character sticker packs. Good luck shopping! 
 A personal story of brain injury presented in a sentimental mushy story line.  I too am dealing with my brain injury and the process of acceptance, understanding, coping, and movement toward a fulfilling, happy, and peaceful life.  It is a difficult process.  The author most certainly conveyed her story. I found the book to be a shallow pep talk with no redeeming qualities.  It lacked depth in articulation or any substance to medical fact or rehabilitation.  If you are interested in a book with a survivors story that has meat to it read "Over my Head" by Claudia Osborn.  I've read it five times and will read it many more times.  My family and friends have praised the book for giving them an understanding that I could not communicate so precisely and eloquently.  "Over my Head" is simply the best book coveying personal experience with brain injury that I have ever read 
 This book was written in 2000 from events occuring in 1998!!!  Totally out of date! Useless!! Wondering why it is still for sale.  The author, contacted by email responded but did not address the questions asked, simply giving excuses and mentioning that he wrote another book much better than this one...  Outrageaous!  Spread the word and if you own the book, get your money back 
 This dispenser has a strong resistance and makes it difficult to pull back the lever with the thumb.  When it closes, it tends to leave behind a drop of syrup that can run down the side 
 This author is incredibly biased and left Cuba when he was a child- too young to remember or understand anything. I don't know his family's story, but the truth is that most of the Miamians have never even been to Cuba and are 2nd and 3rd generation, and that the first wave of Cubans was not poor people on rafts- it was fascists who supported Batista, rich brothel and casino owners, mobsters, etc. Not a great crowd, to say the least. People love Fidel Castro throughout the world for a reason... check out "Fidel, the Untold Story" for a good documentary that gives the other side. I'm not saying Fidel hasn't done some bad things, but he's not even close to the Stalin that the liars in Miami paint him as. For all my anti-Communist sentiment, I have to say, this book is ridiculous. Anyone who actually believes that Cuba was better under Batista had better think twice about the sources they are hearing. 
 James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers.   I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem?  Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree 
 I have been trying to order this from Amazon since October 2005. Twice now they have delayed and delayed the delivery for months only to finally cancel the order. They clearly do not have access to this book 
 Considering the fact that the University of California - Berkeley boasts the largest repetoire {sp?} of school songs of ANY university in the country makes the fact that this compilation has not included ANY of them problematic at the very least.  Big C (or Sons of Westwood to you theiving baby bears out there) - Fight for California - Sons of California - Stanford Jonah - Golden Bear - Make Way for the Bear - Roll On - Cal Band March - California Triumph - Palms of Victory - California Indian Song - California Marching Song - One More River - All Hail - Hail to California - California, We're For You --  Take your pick - they are all fantastic - and I think I forgot a few...  To leave out Cal is either shoddy work or bad temperment.  Go Bears - Beat the Cougars 
 I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour.  In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour.  Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again.  I find most of this album to be very average.  Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all.  The majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics.  There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably "Safe In New York City" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic.  Probably one of the bands weakest efforts 
 We recently purchased this book in anticipation of a trip to the Outer Banks (as I am sure anyone looking at this is considering doing). The book was a useful tool but we did encounter some problems.  First, I'll mention what they got right: the book is very comprehensive and all the various categories (lodging, attractions, et cetera) are grouped by the town they are in. This was useful as we would spend a day or two in a town and then move on to another. We found the accomodations section especially helpful as we did not make reservations in advance. The hotels we stayed at were all acceptable (and as described in the book) and the price ranges in the book reflected the real world cost.  But this guide is not without its faults. While we did not run into any trouble with our lodging, the blurbs in the guide about each hotel do not appear to be written by people who stayed at the hotel but read more like the literature a hotel would give out. I am not sure how the hotel reviews were gathered but they really read more like advertisements than reviews.  Finally, where the guide really steered us wrong (and a big reason why I think the bulk of the "reviews" are just blurbs received from the owners of the establishments) was with the Native American Museum. The guide described this as a very nice visit and one where admission would be $2 per person. Well, when we got there it was $5. Furthermore, when we made the mistake of going inside, we found anything but an enjoyable time. The building is a crowded mismash of items with no explanation for their appearance there. One closest-like enclosure contains three glass cases of various head gear. I particularly enjoyed seeing the Maryland State police baseball cap. Of course there was no explanation for why such a hat would be on display. Alas, the baseball cap was behind glass so I couldn't touch this important relic. The MD police cap is indicative of the whole experience. After winding through all these clutter, we came to a television set in the basement with nothing but static. It truly felt like the beginning of a bad horror movie. Avoid this scam at all costs.  Given that the reviews of attractions are, at best, not very critical, and, at worst, advertisements sent in by the owners, I would suggest picking up a different guide, getting literature from the visitor's center in Kitty Hawk (very helpful folks there) or asking around when you get there. We found the Cape Hatteras lighthouse (and the climb to the top) especially enjoyable. We also found the Duke of Dare motel in Manteo to be an inexpensive alternative to some of the larger hotels. Also, the Oregon Inlet has a great public swimming area that was never crowded. Enjoy your trip 
 I think this is one of the "Richard Scarry" books, not a genuine Richard Scarry. The pictures don't look quite right and the writing is all wrong 
 Agree with all other reviews. Kid enjoys the keyboard but also gets frustrated when the glued together mic stand breaks again and again...the mic itself only works intermittently...this also causes frustration. This would get a 1 star but because she enjoys it for the brief moments that it works and before the mic stand collapses, I am generously giving 2 stars 
 I was attracted to this novel after reading a non-fiction article on stem cell research written by the author that was anthologized in Best American Science and Nature Writing. McManus' daughter has had diabetes since childhood, and when I discovered that he had written a novel about a 29-year-old woman with diabetes who takes a cross-country bike trip to lay her personal demons I hoped for a tale of overcoming great obstacles. I was taken with the character and kept reading to hear more about her even as the unlikely events piled one on top of the other. I gave the author a LOT of slack hoping for a thoughtful, enlightening denouement from someone who clearly is an accomplished writer as well as the parent of a diabetic. I will not spoil the book in case someone wants to read it, but suffice it to say that I felt betrayed and disgusted by the ending.  My thought as I closed the book was, "With all the books on my shelf to be read, why did I waste time on this?" My advice, "Don't. 
 As far as acting, story line, directing, casting, and sexiness, it's a dud. Another ultra-hyped mediocrity. Enjoyable to a degree for just how incomprehensible it is 
 "The spy who loved me" is the oddest of Ian Fleming's Bond novels. It is basically the slightly risqué (for the time) story of the sexual awakening of a girl, Vivienne Michel (the story is told through her eyes and Fleming even credits her with co-authorship of the book). James Bond? He turns up about half-way through the book to rescue her from a couple of baddies at a motel in which she is working and share his, er, experience of life with her.  So, what has this to do with this film? They have in common the title and a character called James Bond; there all resemblance ends. In this regard, it's a bit like the Fleming Bond short story "Octopussy", which shares the same fate.   The film has thus to stand on its own merits, of which there are precisely none. This is the most appalling hokum, silly story, woodenly acted by Roger Moore (who did once have the honesty to say that his acting talents went all the way from A very nearly to B) and others. Now I know that the Bond films are not really meant to be nerve-tingling thrillers, because you know that our hero and his panoply of ever more absurd gadgets is indestructible and equal to anything, but are more droll comedies with miscellaneous stunts and explosions thrown in, but I didn't find this one funny at all. (Makes solemn resolution never again to watch any more Bonds in which Roger Moore appears). 
 This is one of the worst movies ever! It seems to just have been an excuse for the actress and her director husband to show off her naked body 
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 Terrible. If I'd have heard what it said in the annoying tone it always speaks in, I never would have bought it. It is high quality, it won't break. I've tried. Nothing like teaching your kid to honk the horn and have an obnoxious voice yell "get out of the way!".  And that "slow down little fella...." Why did the makers assume that only boys would play with this toy? Don't waste your money. 
 As a new bride, I thought this book was --well--let's say---BORING!. No style..no design and these authors are "lost" as far as what brides want in the 21st century. If you are young, hip and cool, this book is not for you. If you are old on a 4th marriage, you might like it. Also-warning ..these authors have TERRIBLE reviews on their Baby Bargains book. It seems they write all their own great reviews. I think Martha Stewart weddings is OBVIOUSLY much better and I also think I would not recommend a book from Denise and Alan Field's EVER 
  I've been watching the changing trends in dog training for about thirty years, using a kind of semiotics approach to the subject, meaning that what you see in any one specific discipline--science, politics, or the arts--may be reflective of an underlying trend within the zeitgeist itself.  For dog training, back in the 70s it was the Woodhouse way, even though Babs was kind of insane:  "If your dog keeps getting into the chicken coop and killing your chickens, there's nothing to do but kill one of them yourself and beat the offending pooch about the head with the carcass!"  (I'm paraphrasing, but still...)  Next came the alpha theory, with all the dominance trainers proclaiming that their method was based on "scientific evidence" about canine social behavior, which we now know is a fallacy. According to recent research there is no hierarchy in wild wolf packs and the hierarchies that form in captive wolf groups are totally unnatural.  According to authors Masson and McCarthy there is no pecking order in some chicken groups (which is where the idea of dominance hierarchies got its start, back in the 1920s).  And according to animal researchers John McNutt and Lesley Boggs, the wild dogs of Africa, who form highly organized social groups, and are the most successful predators in Africa, have no pack leader.  This is my roundabout way of saying that I'm amused by the current crop of authors of "positive" dog training books such as Pat Miller, who have a gung-ho, we've finally found it, this is the real way to train attitude.  Like Miller I used to train the old-fashioned way and found that it was destructive to the social bond I had with the dogs I trained.  So I'm opposed to those methods, just as all "positive" trainers are.   And I have no beef with Miller or Jean Donaldson or any of the +R mavens from that standpoint.  But from what I can see we're currently living in a zeitgeist, a world culture where rigidly held belief systems--whether they're of a religious, political, or dog training nature--hold sway over real ethical and moral values, and stand in the way of the search for truth.    There are three main points where I think "positive" trainers diverge from truth and ethics:  ONE: Dogs hate head halters.  THEY HATE THEM.  Yet all the "positive training" books recommend this hateful device that tortures a dog's emotions.  Since it's been propagandized as a "positive training tool" it fits the trainer's pre-molded belief system, which prevents him or her from objectively examining the facts.  This is NOT a positive training tool.  In fact it's not a training tool at all.  It's designed to relentlessly punish the dog for pulling, and does NOTHING to teach him how to enjoy walking next to you.  TWO: One of the main "talking points" for most positive trainers is that dogs have a "what's in it for me" attitude, which they say is the key to training.  And while the survival instincts of ALL animals impose a strong directive toward self-interest, dogs are the one species that is least likely to exhibit a "me first" attitude as the chief feature of their psychology.  If you ask me, they have more of a "what can I do with my energy?" or a "what can we do together?" attitude; they're genetically engineered to want to be team players.  THREE: Positive techniques aren't all that positive.  They rely too much on food, which is an extrinsic reinforcer, and therefore can create a negative learning experience for the dog.  And some techniques for dealing with problem behaviors actually put the dog in a confused, lonely, and agitated state.  That's not nice and it's not positive.  Instead of forcing the dog to figure out "How can I get a reward from my owner?" I think it's better and more effective to use techniques that build the reward into the behavior, via intrinsic reinforcers.  Some books that show you how to do this are PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG by Patricia Gail Burnham, NATURAL DOG TRAINING by Kevin Behan, and SCHUTZHUND: THEORY AND TRAINING METHODS by Susan Barwig and Stewart Hilliard.  Granted, you may have to "weed out" some of the techniques in some of these books (particularly the schutzhund book), but at heart they're all much more positive AND more ethical than THE POWER OF POSITIVE DOG TRAINING.  But if your desire is for a training manual that fits in with the current trend or tells you what you already believe about dogs, by all means read and implement the techniques in THE POWER OF POSITIVE DOG TRAINING.  It may not make your dog's life all that better, but you'll be safely nestled in the arms of the zeitgeist. 
 This thermometer is not very accurate or consistant. Whenever my son was sick and we used this it would give a normal temperature reading and I knew that it couldn't be right. We would take our sons temperature 3 times in a row and never get the same reading twice. I even check my own temperature and it would come up with crazy readings like 95.1! We got rid of this one because fever-induced seizures run in my husbands family and we needed something more accurate. It has been my experience that nothing digital gives accurate readings and that the old-fashion oral and rectal thermometers work best 
 I have read and loved this story since a young girl, I recently decided to purchase my own copy and went with the "Digi---" version because it was the least expensive.  The amazon website says nothing about this being an abbridged book, but it is.  I thought I was just mis-remembering my previous dozen readings of the tale, but a passage at the very end revealed that it was not my imagination- this is a cut work.  I was already displeased with my purchase because there are dozens of typos, transposed words, and even blatant butchering of a Ms. Annabel Bliss' name into an unreadable first name and the last name "Blish".  Now that I know it is abridged I am determined to return the item for a true copy and call Amazon to suggest that they not sell abridged (and sloppy butchered) versions without proper disclosure.       By all means, order this delightful story but do not order the  "Digi---" version (with a plain purple cover), spring for extra money to get a reliable version, the Puffin or "Original Publisher" versions should be better.  Good luck = 
 What in "heavens name" were they thinking? Probably the most gorgeous western ever filmed and they chose to release it in non-anamorphic format? This is unthinkable! Never mind that this epic flopped because of a viewing public with the attention span of a gnat, this film deserved to be released in the best format possible. This edition is the best so far but sorely lacking English subtitles. After repeatedly backing up the scenes in busy downtown Casper I am still to decipher much of the dialogue. The audio mixing could have been better here. What has happened to the directors hand in this release? Was he banned access to this film for all time? This is not the only film for which I have been awaiting a deserving release. The studios often have themselves to blame for their losses when butchering a directors vision simply because they think that the public doesn't have the potential to appreciate. "Reds" was another epic film that failed at box office, yet here it is 25 years later with it's long overdue proper release on DVD. I hope it won't take that long to see the proper release of this film 
 I'm a big fan of her other works, but this one was so fragmented and uninspired that I quit without finishing.  Life is too short to waste time reading bad books 
 This is the one of the worst movies ive seen.Its absoloutly pathetic i just dont get the point.Come on you can do better 
 Disc was defective,tried on multible DVD players and PC.Product was void.Reordered,same ending.  Promo appears very interesting and remarkable,but disc was BLANK!Very displeased.  Would like to view actual product.  Post Script: I give positive feedback and was impressed with Amazon's return and replace attempt.Very Professional and helpful.Great Job.Thanx Amazon.JP  
 Knowing that 20th Century Fox IS capable of quality restoration, as proven in their 30+ Studio Classics Series, I was let down by the amature color reproduction of what should be the magic that film's shot in technicolor produce.  Of the two films from 20th Century, "Jesse James" and "The Return of Frank James", "Jesse James" is so poorly transferred to DVD that I had to remove all color from my television calibration panel and then adjust the picture for the best quality b&w that my Sony is capable of.  It is truly a shame when a company seems to arbitrarily decide to reproduce some classic films to their glorious original condition and then simply ignore others.  In 1939 Tyrone Power was Hollywoods leading man. In The Mask of Zorro (Another 20th Century Fox film) the DVD transfer and restoration by 20th Century Fox was excellent.  This is a sham and an insult to technicolor's genius. Those who enjoy film do not simply consider the plot to be the only critiera by which a film is enjoyed or judged.  All elements of making a film from lighting, to composition, to color, sound, etc.. all play a part in a film's drama.  BUT NOT IN THIS PATHETIC LONG AWAITED TECHNICOLOR CLASSIC. I would not have purchased this film if I had known that it would look as if it had been stored in a cardboard box along with all the color family photos that now have a pale cyan/magenta cast, no detail in the shadows and an overall reproduction that makes most of the photos and film look as if it were shot at night. "The Return of Frank James" is still presented in rather good Technicolor (not its best either). The stories, no matter how historically fictional they may be, are sheer Western fun.   But that fun is diminished when the visual presentation of the stories are so poorly presented that one has to wonder if consistency of quality is a commitment by 20th Century Fox.  You may want to think about buying "Jesse James" if you are a true film buff but if you still want another Tyrone Power classic for your DVD collection, remember you will probably have to remove ALL color and enjoy it in b&w. 
 Nope, it is not funny. Some people might not consider me qualified to review this, as I did not even finish watching it, but personally, I was highly offended. Madea is nothing more than violent and abusive. End of story. Once she got out the belt and started beating her foster child, I had to turn it off, as I was highly disturbed. Who promotes this as being funny? That is a sad situation which unfortunately happens to lots of kids, and as a teacher and former camp counselor, I have unfortunately had direct contact with many children who have been abused in a similar way. I am sure anyone who has had direct experience with victims of abuse would agree with me that it is never funny to promote any form of domestic abuse. And all the other scenes were extremely boring. Do not watch this movie, unless you think abuse is funny, and then you are just sick 
 This book claims to be written in a large font, however the font is barely larger than the paperback edition.  The large print edition is at most 2 points larger than the paperback, maybe a 12 or 13 point font.  What makes this book bigger is the extra space at the bottom of the page which is not all that usefull for making notes.  This edition is poorly laid out for enjoyable reading and useful notation.  Don't waste you money to get this so called "large print" edition, you should probably just buy the regular sized one.  
 How sad to see such a great actor such as Basil Rathbone in this crap after all his great films of the thirties,maybe it was personal financial troubles that forced him to accept his role in this movie that is so bad that it makes Plan 9 look acceptable 
 The story just never takes off & is just too many pages of lukewarm nonsense.  The side story of Griselda is better told than the main characters' story.  VERY disappointed 
 Ok, never buy electronics online. I first ordered this tablet online, and when I got it, it installed just fine, however, the pen was not working. Had Adesso send a new pen. Seemed to work fine. But when I started drawing, the tablet itself made the pen jerk at two spots which looked like two strips might not have been working. So it was impossible to draw anything with it. Had that returned for a new one.  Now when it comes to actually drawing, the pressure sensitivity and the actual use of the pen itself were just downright awkward. Pressure is one thing, it can be adjusted and I could just learn how to use it. But the pen itself needs to be almost pointing directly down on the tablet in order for it to even see the pen was there. Tilt the pen too far down like a normal person draws, and the point of the pen would no longer be touching the pad, because it's so small.  It has a USB cable, so it should be plug and play. The tablet gets recognized, but the pen takes a while for it to even be able to move the mouse cursor around to do anything with it. The pen and mouse are wireless, so the tablet picks up their signal when touching. There's a light that keeps flashing when neither is touching the pad, but when they do the light stays lit. But even with this happening, the pen does not always begin working even if the light is lit.  Simply getting a hold of Adesso was a chore in itself. After going online sending e-mails, and even calling them on the phone, the whole situation took a few months in total for them to give me a return number so I could mail it back to them, until they finally had the free time to send me a new one, which is still not reliable.  Now buying a pricey product online was my own fault, because if you get it at the store you can return it right away and have the whole thing settled in a day or two. Sending things by mail takes days, weeks, and eventually a few months in my case. Don't buy this, or any product from Adesso 
 Seems to be just another ideologically based treatise and not serious economics. Although everyone that thinks has some degree of plotical bias, this piece appears to be more written to provide talking points for the far Left. Disappointing. 
 American lives.  Hannity receives his talking points every day from the RNC, and then repeats them like the Summoner from "Canterbury Tales," repeating his two or three Latin phrases.  Hannity's phrases: - Liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.  - Liberals don't want to defend America and fought Homeland Security every step of the way (when it was Bush who fought it)  - Howard Dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is Hillary, Al Gore, John Kerry, and every republican except for Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman.  - Osama bin laden was offered up to Clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)  So, as Al Franken says, Hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.  Don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  He is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs 
 Too bad such a great historic moment was trivalized. Choppy. Too long. No substance. Phony. Suggest Clint return to being a mayor. His acting & directing days are over. 
 does not live up to the hype, no wonder he works with Jakob Nielsen, same thinking "structures" erm. nice idea seeds, would fit into a four pager, even with examples.  don't buy this book, the seven bullet items summarize all included.  much awrite about nothing 
 As a gothic-horror-lover i bought this according to the high-praising reviews, acclaiming it as "atmospheric", "moody", "stylish", "gothic horror gem"... WELL... If you ever saw Terence Fisher's 'Horror of Dracula' from 1958 (in fact 10 years before this film!) you know where the benchmark for classic gothic horror lies. This Hammer Horror movie masterpiece delivers not only the visual beauty of gothic atmosphere and technicolor delights, but also magnificent performances and dynamic suspense.  Kill, Baby... Kill! whereas is really a lame and tedious experience in this genre.  Despite of its overly moody gothic sets, the suspensful musical score and the lush settings and colors, there is really not enough atmosphere or suspense that may grip you and get you into the story. The plot is very weak and holds no real surprises.  Overall it looks rather cheap and lacks of good performances or dialogues (whereof there are few). The repetitive all too long "creepy shots" can get really annoying even if the director tries really hard to make suspensful Hitchcock-style camera work. Sorry, but that's not enough.  This is neither a real Gothic Horror (cause it's too cheap) nor a Giallo (cause there's no gore).  If you think that gothic atmosphere sets, "endless spiral staircase shots" and a more or less creepy child staring into the camera are enough to make a good horror movie, then this one's for you.  To everyone else i recommend any Cushing/Lee Hammer movie or V.Price Poe movie for real atmospheric classic gothic horror! 
 On Amazon this product stated it was compatible with the Sansa e200 series.  I ordered with that expectation but it does not work.  
 I gagged my way through The Notebook but thought I would give Nicholas Sparks another try.  I read about 1/3 of the book and decided it was a waste of my time.  
 This books is ok. I don't really know what Danzy was talking about, though. What was with that list of black people (who weren't even black!)? I'm guessing it's a joke that went over my head. I stopped reading after David Mura's part. He said Dean Cain was 1/2 Japanese. Dean Cain is 1/4. I think people should check their facts before writing something that will be published. I can't go on with this book. Eventually I will because he wasn't the only writer in the book. His just bothered me. Even if it's a little thing, giving wrong information isn't a good thing 
 I was so disappointed in this album.  It just didn't jump up and grab me like his other albums.  The songs are o.k., and there just isn't a song that I can even say I really like and want to hear over and over like his previous albums. Borrow a friends first to check it out before you see if you want to buy it 
 Rule number one if you're making a Stephen King movie, especially if it's a TV movie; make it scary or don't make it at all!  THE TOMMYKNOCKERS fails to do this miserably!  For most of the film, you're watching a lot of green light and a lot of silly inventions.  Granted, that's all in the book, but it written chillingly by King in a way only he can do it.  There are some exciting alien moments at the end, but by then it's too late.  You've just spent three hours watching a bad knock off of an X-FILES episode.  On the plus side, I had no problem watching the infamous Traci Lords act like like a total slut!  Bless her 
 When my Krups coffee grinder finally expired after several years of faithful service, I decided to order the Capresso because of its larger capacity and vaunted "cool grind."  I wish I had ordered the  Krups instead.  The Capresso takes much longer to grind the coffee, and the  design ensures that no matter how careful you are, you will spill ground  coffee all over your counter.  In the time since I bought it another  reviewer has reported that his or her Capresso broke within six months.  Do  not buy this model 
 The plot and its development are extremely weak.  Acting is marginal and special effects are questionable.  What can I say, I love SciFi, have a thing about time travel flicks and enjoy punishing myself with B rated SciFi movies.  If you're looking for quality entertainment, then this is not the choice for you.  If you're a nut about SciFi, go for it Bro 
 Ugh!  Ideal-mad, patriotic tripe.  The protagonist wishes never to see or hear about his country again, and instead of being unloaded in, say, France or even Africa - which would get him out of America's hair and comply with his wishes - he is tortured by being carried around on ships for the rest of his life.  What the... 
 But not quite. While I wouldn't say this was a terrible novel, I also wouldn't say that it was in any way memorable. Because of the wonderful dramatization on the audio cassette, I passed an afternoon at work more  pleasantly, being entertained by the acting skills of the readers. However,  if I'd been merely reading a text version of this story, I wouldn't have  finished it because the plot did not interest me enough to deserve my full  attention. The characters are too typical of a mystery novel, the prose  style unremarkable, and the ending not too exciting 
 I know this type of person. I've watched his unbearable TV show. I ask, why can't we all just get along?  Being a peace lover, and a church going Christian, his ways are VERY un-Christian like.  Jesus would not approve, Bill, but luckily for you, God is very forgiving.  Attacking others is not very nice.  Most of us learned that in Kindergarten.  And I really wonder how TRADITIONAL it is to hate others when you can't, or won't, comprehend what their lives are like.  Perhaps we should go back to burning at the stake, lynching, or segregation to prove just how Christian, Traditional and Patriotic the United States really is. Do I need to remind you, Bill, and your brain-washed followers that this country was founded by men trying to escape persecution for believing something different?  Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all citizens?  Those who hate will love this book, those with an open, loving, tolerant mind will know better.  
 Did not work right out of the box.  Followed the directions to reset and it still did not work.  Button on side is too small.  I returned it to Amazon 
 I love Myrtle Beach and all of the South and was very excited to read a Southern author.  What a huge disappointment!  I'm curious how this is a National Bestseller as advertised 
 To give context to my comments, I have a degree in Middle East History and bought this book, first edition, in 1992.  I began it several times over the years, only to be defeated by the dry prose and ceaseless repetition of unrelated facts.  I finally sat down to read it from start to finish a few months ago.  Now that I've finally finished, I realize that I wish I had never made the attempt.  It is boring, but worse than that, it is deceptive.  All references come for the first edition, hardback.  1. p. 191, Regarding domed buildings, "the transition from the square hall to the round dome posed a problem which was solved by the use of the squinch or pendentive, often with stalacites for decoration."  This quote gives the false impression the Arabs solved the problem of placing a dome on a square hall.  Google "Haggia Sophia" and you will see a dome sitting on a square hall built by Eastern Roman Christians in the 500s.  2.  Constantly discusses communist Arabs in a neutral to positive light (p. 325) but fails to mention the presence of fascist influences in Arab politics, especially the roots of fascism in the Ba'ath Party as a result of Arabism's fascination with 1930s European power politics.  3. p. 359, Regarding the move by the surrounding Arab communities to crush the newly created Israel, Arab "forces moved into the mainly Arab parts of the country."  Hourani then claims fighting broke out because the absence of borders allowed Jews "to occupy the greater part of the country."  This is a deliberate falsification on Hourani's part.  The Arab forces publicly stated aims was the destruction of Israel and the removal of the Jewish community from Palestine.  4.  p. 368, Regarding the resolution of the 1956 Suez Canal Conflict, "Under American and Soviet pressure . . . the three forces withdrew."  Here Hourani implies, falsely, that France, Britain and Israel were affected equally by U.S. and Soviet threats.  In fact, the U.S. Sixth Fleet shielded the three combatant forces from the irrelevant Soviet forces, while acting to pressure the combatants to withdraw.  Even more, Eisenhower's use of economic retaliation against the weak French and British economies did most of the work.  5.  p. 413, In one of the most egregious passages, blames Israel for a war of aggression against the peaceful Egypt, Jordan and Syria in the Six Days War.  I recommend the book, aptly titled, Six Days of War: June 1967 and the Making of the Modern Middle East to dispel any misunderstandings fostered by Hourani.  6.  Even when writing honestly, Hourani tends towards dry, and needless, repetition.  By way of example are his nearly indistinguishable passages on Arab poetry on pages 12-14, 49-51, 87, 153, 187, 193-195, 239, 305, 340, 395-397, which could be summarized as "Poetry, both oral and written, is the greatest achievement of Arab culture.  Even today it retains many of the same themes and similar structures to that created in pre-Islamic times."  Except Hourani takes 18 pages over the course of the book to say it.  In conclusion, I can not recommend this book for either the beginner or specialist.  The beginner will be overwhelmed by the flood of unexplained names, dates, facts and figures.  The specialist will constantly find problems with Hourani's accuracy and honesty.  There are too many good books on both Arab and Islamic history for you to waste your time on this one 
 The book tries to reinvent science by computer experiments on CA and to justify this by a shaky "principle of computational equivalence". It is way too much a stretch. There are various statements in the book which show that the author misunderstood what science is all about. An example is that the author mixed up the scientific methodology and the content of science with the method used to describe science. Among the various chapters where the author tried to account for the areas of science, the shakiest one is its account for quantum physics. I encourage the readers to read the chapter carefully to see for themselves. Anyway, after reading the book, I have to sadly say that the book does not have what it takes to support its claim. The author wasted too much of his time and the readers', too. Potential readers: don't waste your money on the book. If you need to read it to see how confused the author is, just check it out in the book store or from you local library if possible 
 i remeber when this come in the 9th grade i got change to see jet li for the frist time and Isaiah washington i already know aaliyah i grew to her  i saw her talk about this movie  on rosie show i herad from my friends in school while i was in class one day nobody talk about much aaliyah was here . aaliyah did ok the movie was fake i seen his HK MOVIES HE did butt kicking than the soundtarck is better aaliyah did well on try again. buy ounce time in china or fist of lenged jet li best.  
 i read this book and the basic story was very good. it dealt with 2 young men who find a way to bring dinosaurs back to life. the story there was pretty good until you remember that this is supposed to be a story about buffy the vampire slayer. the author does not seem to remember that until the end where the slayer and slayerettes get thrown in more as an after thought at the end. i would have given the book a better rating if they had interacted more in the  story 
 The Virgin Suicides starring Kristen Dunst, Josh Hartnett, Kathleen Turner and James Woods lacks depth and a convincing storyline. This film is directed by Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), I really tried to like this movie but I was fooling myself, you would think this movie would be a hidden gem because of the Coppola legacy but just because your father is Frances Ford Coppola doesn't mean you belong in the same category as best director of all-time. Sometimes magic does not stirke twice. How can all five sisters end up killing themselves, their homelife wasn't that unbearable, a lot of parents are religious, but that doesn't mean you'll wind up with thoughts of impending suicide. Kristen Dunst just gets on my nerves, her acting is the same in every film. Don't believe the hype, The Virgin Suicides is not a groundbreaking, poetic film 
 but compared to many of the other Mutant and Masterminds products, this is junior varsity at best.  "Noir" is clearly the work of people who understand and love film noir, but lose sight of some rather important elements of a good RPG setting book.  There are two basic problems with "Noir."  The first is technical.  At $17.95 for a total of 64 pages, it's awfully expensive.  Unlike the "Freedom City" sourcebook, which had time to explore a fictional city's geography, politics, radio stations, public transit system, professional sports teams, criminal activity, super-criminal activity, and reasonably priced family restaurants, "Noir" only has space for passing references to people, places, and events.  You'd think that Communist spy-rings, ghostly hauntings, and mafia hangouts would be better described for a game specifically about busting up spies, ghosts, and gangsters, but sadly, there just isn't enough room.  The second problem is thematic.  Super-heroes and film noir just don't go together, since one of the overarching themes of film noir is that there are no such things as heroes: everybody's guilty of something, and looking out for number one is the only smart thing to do.  Film Noir characters exist in a world where one person cannot change the world, and superheroes, by use of their "powers and abilities far beyond mortal men," clearly can.  "Noir" tries to square this circle by limiting the scope of superpowers, but the game would have been better served if it had just avoided the unearthly altogether and stuck to private-eyes, gunsels, and femme fatales.  I wish I could give this book a two-and-a-half star rating, because truthfully it's not bad.  All the same, compared to products like "Freedom City" and "Annual," "Noir" comes up very short 
 The Winner and Absolute  truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books. Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books. Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world 
 I'm in Paris right now. And I have to admit, that before I arrived here, I had visions of berets, perfect stockings, cigarettes, and street accordions dancing in my head. But I'm getting this feeling that it is basically the same everywhere, at least in cities. There  will be large department stores, chains of McDonalds, KFC, Starbucks, homeless people, fat people, scruffy people. Which is of course a "duh". The characteristics that Ollivier attribute to French girls can really be seen everywhere; New York, Rome, London,  Chicago etc. Girls honestly look the same everywhere generally; boots with slim jeans or pants tucked in, wearing a short fitted jacket, yada yada. So really. Stop being such a poser. You're only embarrassing yourself by denouncing your origins and who you really are 
 I do not know what all these 5 star reviews are raving about.  I didn't like this book for several reasons.  They are, in no particular order: It's about too many people and not one of them gets a thorough development--it's just snipets of lots of people's lives.  It's only about women--how boring!  The men in the book are in the background and hardly even named.  This means only mother-daughter relationships are discussed, and it makes for pretty monotonous fare by the end of the book.  Finally, the theme of rebellion against old world culture has potential, but the author gives it a very one-dimensional treatment.  Simply move away from home and drink too much and you're saying something new and different about living in the American melting pot?  In short, I though this book was shallow.  I wouldn't have finished it if not for the book group I read it for 
 Sober and Wilson attempt to reduce the perception of evolution as necessarily leading to individualism and selfishness by resurrecting group selection as the means by which altruism has also evolved. Unfortunately they have produced a book which not only fails but is a laborious read.  The authors clearly accept kin-selection and the gene's-eye view yet fail to show how these methods already explain altruism and cooperation. Their attempts to show that there is altruism beyond this only leads to misrepresentations and a contrived argument.  Their definition of a group is 'a set of individuals that influence each other's fitness with respect to a certain trait' and groups are therefore 'defined on a trait by trait basis'. This sounds to me as if it is actually more along the lines of Dawkins' extended phenotype which is fine but is not how people understand groups and group selection.  The main problem with group selection is the lack of stable entities that can be called groups in the first place. The authors try to leave out sexual reproduction to make it easier but this is unacceptable. One or both sexes move between groups to breed so they are always fluctuating entities and within a species there can be separated groups of males or solitary males. In humans females moved between groups either willingly or by force. Though cooperation within groups is important it is a major omission to overlook the importance of actual numbers of fertile females and female fertility in the successful expansion of groups and how this leads to male-male competition within groups and between groups of male kin.  The authors do raise the relevance of empathy but other writers make a much better case of how the biological mother-infant bond has expanded to some degree to the human male and beyond parental feelings to group feelings (eg Jonathan Haidt in 'The Happiness Hypothesis').  Sober and Wilson have contrived evidence for 'pure' altruism, contrived a definition of 'group' and contrived models of 'group-selection' that are frankly impossible to relate to reality. Though well intended they have unfortunately merely produced a book that to read is like wading through mud and does nothing but confuse the debate. A very disappointing book 
 As someone wrote, if Amazon allowed us to rate negatively, I would rate this book minus 9. This is NOT a real tab book. Contains parts of solos here and there. If the publisher would be serious, they would scrap this version and re-do it. It is bad because it contains the songs of the fist maiden albums. Give a try to these guys though 3W guitarrockpower. they sell on you know which popular sites. Their tabs are often very long (10 pages or so) but all the notes are there 
 The books are in fine condition.  My problem is with Amazon! I will never buy text books on Amazon again!  Waited over 2 months for the books that were promised within 10 days.  Not just one book, but 5 out of 8 that I ordered. Never, Never again! 
 This book is an okay book for those just beginning to talk with their kids about their adoption stories.  In simple language it tells about the day they met.  In my experience as an adoption professional, though, most adoption stories--at least domestic--include some contact with the birth mom and/or dad and perhaps their families.  This book would be richer if it were revised to include that contact 
 This movie is for liberals what the Left Behind book series is for Christian conservatives, it portrays reality how they want to see it. Its like they wanted to make a good story but tried too hard to cram as much PC political propaganda in as possible and ended up ruining it. Entertaining in some parts but pretty dumb overall IMO 
 Altough Yafa does include a few useful tidbits of information, his malice for and bias against the cotton industry ultimately precludes this book as a good source for useful information. Yafa's bias renders his judgement suspect, and what could have been a fascinating tale becomes yet another piece of propaganda. 
 I'm giving two stars solely for the great cinematography. Otherwise, this is waste of over two hours. It's the simple story of an on-again-off-again romance between two college boys, one of whom is unwilling to commit. It's devoid of dialogue for the most part and it goes absolutely nowhere. Scene after scene of...well...nothing. The plot, such as it is, flashes back and forth to no real effect. It seems too much an attempt to be artsy and falls flat there as well. Thankfully, there was enough good camera work, lighting, etc. to keep me interested, but only visually. Two+ hours was just too much, though. 
 I simply cannot comprehend the anti-capitalist rantings on this and other sites. Bill Quinn is a bitter old man. He is bitter about his life and about his life choices. He obviously resides in a fantasy world in which nothing changes and progress is unheard of.   Is Wal-Mart evil? No, because even though corporations are considered persons for business purposes, they in fact have no persona. That is, a corporation cannot be evil because a corporation is not a living being. It is a legal entity comprised of physical assets and managed by people.   I will repeat my usual comments with regard to anti-Wal-Mart individuals.   1. If you think Wal-Mart is a horrible employer-don't apply for a position there.  2. If you think Wal-Mart is a horrible buyer-don't deal with Wal-Mart.  3. If you think Wal-Mart is not a consumer's best friend-don't shop there.  Wal-Mart does NOT put the little man out of business. The only "little man" harmed by Wal-Mart (ie. by the customers)is the mom and pop that is open M-F from 9:30am to 4:00pm with an hour for lunch. It is the mom and pop that offers a poor selection of shoddy merchandise at ridiculously high prices because you cannot get this merchandise anywhere else. Then, when Wal-Mart comes to town, the people who have been held hostage by small-town economics choose to shop at Wal-Mart. Low prices, convenient hours, great selection, no hassle return policy, and a clean shopping experience make Wal-Mart the retailer of choice. Certainly there is a reason why those with a choice, the consumer, choose Wal-Mart.   When our new super Wal-Mart opened, it spawned two seperate shopping plazas, including a new Giant Eagle, a Target, A Dick's Sporting Goods, Sam's Club, Starbucks, Quiznos, numerous restaraunts, clothing stores, pet stores, shoe stores, jewelry stores, office supply stores, etc. All of these stores are thriving. Given the arguments posted here, there should be 20 empty storefronts and one evil Wal-Mart, still open for business. Reality over Rhetoric, people.  Finally, the economic impact. I will not mention Wal-Marts substantial charitable endeavors. Rather, I will mention the 1.5 million jobs and millions of indirect jobs. I will mention the nearly $300 billion in stock market wealth created by Wal-Mart. I will mention the billions of dollars in wages, taxes, and benefits to local communities. I will mention the billions in income taxes paid each year. Finally, I will mention Wal-Marts contribution to the GDP. Not only does Wal-Mart contribute to top line GDP growth, it also contributes to productivity by decreasing the cost of purchased goods billions each year. American consumers save anywhere from $10-$20 billion a year because of Wal-Marts downward price pressure. That money is used to benefit consumers everywhere.   Think about the facts before you begin a debate about a subject most of you do not understand. Oh, do I welcome responses 
 This is my first---and most likely last---Cook book (sorry, couldn't resist). I recall enjoying the movie Coma, so when I saw this title in a pile of freebies at the local laundromat, I grabbed it. Living in Essex County, MA, the Salem witch hysteria was the hook that kept me going. The premise was intriguing, but the actuality did not measure up. There wasn't all that much mystery---it was pretty easy to guess/predict what had/would happen.   I found Cook's writing to be sub-standard, especially the dialog. He said. She said. He said. Nobody exclaimed, cried, yelled, whimpered, shrieked, moaned, responded, chortled, replied, simpered, laughed, cajoled, pleaded . . . they nearly always "said." How boring! Anywho, Cook also has an annoying habit of dropping $5 and $10 words in the middle of humdrum sentences, thereby jarring the reader out of his/her tedium. A medical lay person expects to stumble over the technical jargon, but not over simple dialog. I found this very distracting, cumbersome, and awkwardly done. It also seems that there's way too much telling and not enough showing in Cook's writing. That said, just like Dr. Maxwell from Salt Lake City, "I want my money back" . . . and I didn't even pay for it 
 I like Evanovich novels for a light read and a few laughs, and usually her hero and heroine are downright combustible - the Stephanie Plum and Joe Morelli relationship, sustained through 12 books so far, being a case in point. But Full Scoop was actually a trial to get through. I could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted Evanovich's comedic rhythm. The whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what I have come to expect from Evanovich. The silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent, leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened? The least forgivable of the sins committed in Full Scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between Maggie and Zack. None at all. So it's hard to label the book: a sort of but not really romance, an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger.... maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller 
 My daughter wanted this for Christmas and her grandparents came through.  We put it outside and the next day it was in pieces on the other side of the yard.  Granted,  we are not having the mildest winter but it is a weather kit, for Pete's sake 
 Allison announces in his first sentence of his Preface that this, the 2nd edition of a book originally published in 1983 is "substantially revised," and so it is, especially the last half of it. It was an important work of scholarship 23 years ago, and a revision after so much time during which he has remained a teacher and scholar specializing in Kant, was bound to excite  broad interest.  It must have gone far toward gaining for him the prestigious prize of $30,000 he was awarded last year (2005) for outstanding Kantian scholarship.    In the preface Allison cites Michelle Grier as having awakened him from his dogmatic slumbers.  In the body of the text he mentions her name only once, but given the compliment to her, my curiosity was aroused.  First I looked at the endnotes in which her work was mentioned by Allison, and then, a little puzzled, I looked carefully over her book, Kant's Doctrine of Transcendental Illusion, published in 2001.  I found many citations of her work in the endnotes.  Adding them up, I found that there were 28 endnotes, these referred, by explicit citation, to 200 pages of her 305 page book.  What one finds in comparing the two books, his and hers, is that every idea or argument that Allison advances and almost every reference, citation to Kant or to other philosophers, supposition, hypothesis, or development is to be found explicitly in Grier.  It is impossible to compare the two books and not conclude that Allison had no new ideas of his own at all, at least for the last half of his book, the half that he claims developments in Kantian scholarship had compelled him to fully and carefully rethink and therefore to have most fully revised.  If one were to remove from Allison's book, however, the ideas, arguments, and so forth that he derived directly and unambiguously from Grier, there would be nothing but minor and for the most part exceedingly trivial asides. It would, to put it simply, not have been publishable.  It is apparent that rather than generously recognizing Michelle Grier by his compliments and endnotes, he was stabbing her in the back.  His "generous" remarks have the effect of diminishing her role in his accomplishment.  He makes it seem as though she inspired him or set him on the right track rather than to have fashioned the final intellectual product that he merely, but arrogantly, rephrased.  Nowhere does he acknowledge the incontestable truth, as of course he cannot, that he was himself entirely empty, and given a choice between remaining silent or stealing from the younger, creative scholar, Michelle Grier, the work he wished he had produced himself, he chose the shabbier but more profitable course.   
 I wrote a review of what I take as a significant distortion and failing of this book.  I note that this review has not been posted on the site.  I am wondering why 
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 Actually, this CD deserves NO stars.  I'm a huge fan of Mandy Patinkin.  At his best he can easily bring me to tears with his interpretations.  And I am an even greater fan of Sondheim.  "Not a Day Goes By" was my wedding processional.  But this album is a massive train wreck.  Mandy's interpretations of most of the songs on the album are so off-base you feel like you've fallen into an alternate universe.  This album just made me angry, angry, angry.  And it should have made Sondeim livid, livid, livid.  I bought three copies, one for myself, one for my parents, and one for my mother-in-law. I trashed my copy and exchanged the other two 
 "In Good Company" goes on and on at the end a little bit, and the ending especially is not fulfilling character/plot-wise.  If it had ended 15-20 minutes before it actually did, I would give it three stars instead of two.  I admit there were quite a few times when I laughed a bit to myself, but it didn't make me fall off the couch or anything. There were other times when I thought the actions of some characters were weird or forced.  Overall it isn't an entirely bad movie, but, like I said, the ending is unfulfilling.  Overall not strong performances coming from Scarlett Johansson or Topher Grace 
 ....if it wasn't for Chancellor Williams' "herrenvolk" mentality, and his obvious distorting of African/Middle Eastern history to make it seem as if all African history was nothing more than a protracted struggle between black and white. This is what ultimately damns what, on the surface, appears to be a brilliant and well-researched book on African history.   One glaring example of shoddy reasoning is Professor Williams' supposition that "white power centers" existed in Northern Egypt about 2800 B.C. This alone is highly improbable, given that virtually all of Egypt at that time, and most of the Levant(ie, Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia, etc.) was either black or brown. Another thing Williams blindly overlooked was that many of the Ancient Egyptian sculuptures were later altered by insecure white anthropologists who could not accept the mere idea of Egypt being an African civilization--something which continues to this very day.   Finally, Chancellor Williams can't bring himself to admit the simple truth as to why ancient African civilizations collapsed: they collapsed for the same reason all the others did--they overextended themselves, grew decadent, and left themselves wide open for invaders. Williams insists that the blacks were too trusting of outside forces. But the same could be said about the Romans trusting the barbarians(whom they allowed into their armies)who eventually destroyed Rome. At bottom, he really seems to believe that Africans are too childlike to build great empires and institutions--in other words, he is projecting his anxieties as an Afro-American onto African issues, and in this he fails miserably 
 I had never read the Scarlet Pimpernel, nor seen any of the films. One day when I didn't have time to finish a chapter, I thought I'd start the Introduction. I was enjoying the mystery-style nature of the story, then, in the first three sentences of the introduction they tell you who the Scarlet Pimpernel is! I have quit reading the book because of this. I plan to start again, in hopes that their spoiler was not far off anyway, but it was a terrible let down - on par with when my sister gave away they end of "The Sixth Sense" - which I could not enjoy, knowing what the big secret was. If you get this edition - or any edition, just in case - don't read the introduction 
 This really is a mixed lot with some catchy tunes and some haunting melodies and also some fillers. Like 'In Blue' before it, this does not reach the standards of 'Talk On Corners' or 'VH1 Live in Dublin'. Standout tracks are 'Summer Sunshine', 'Long Night' and the Gavin Friday/Bono collaboration 'Time Enough For Tears'.Other than that, the rest are B-Sides at best...Disappointin 
 I bought my X5 in early October of 2005 and after about 6 months its been nothing but problems. In under a year I have sent it back to them twice and I am about to do so for a third time. The problem is with the volume, it goes from low to loud randomly. The volume problem appears to be a defect with the X5 itself. I know this because two of my friends deceided to buy it when they saw mine and they have both had the same problem. The difference is that they got tired of sending it back and to be honest with you if they can't fix it this time I won't either. I think I'll be done with this company. When you read all the things the X5 can do it sounds great on paper and it would be a great MP3 Player but it rarely works 
 My dog won't touch this thing, and I'm pretty sure it's because of the smell.  I even tried putting peanut butter on it and he refused to lick it off.  He hates this toy 
 I started reading the book as a part of my personal development with the company that I work for. The book is founded in behaviorism, and does not stray from the concepts associated with this worldview. My issue with it is that I believe that people are more than a reaction to the things that happen to us. We have unique personalities, and they consist of more than the conditioning that they are subjected to. This psychology takes away the idea of free-will and choice, and eliminates personal responsibility. When it comes to managing people, I believe that these are important elements to tap into. This behaviorist approach to management may look good on the surface, and make logical sense, but is flawed by its nature, and cannot have any long lasting impact 
 The book was a decent read but I found Bonanno to be quit repeatative at times.  He goes on and on about the Sicilian way of life, and how American's more or less don't understand it.  Furthermore he tiptoes around all violence that comes with being in the "Family" as he so eloquently puts it.  I found it to be a little dry, not so "tell all", and in the end I find Mr. Bonanno using his Sicilian background and way of life as justification for being in organized crime.  Although he himself would never admit that the "Family" he was apart of was organized crime, the crux of the book.  He calls himself a "Man of Honor" yet he admitly cheats on his wife and lived a life ingrossed in organized crime, hypocritical to say the least 
 this movie is the most disapointed i've never been with a movie i've picked for my wife and i to watch, save your money 
 The contents of this book is based on the KJV Bible.  It is at best, an abridged dictionary.  For a SERIOUS bible scholar, this book is useless. This book was given 1 star because there isn't a 0 star rating.  Received  and returned same day 
 My hunch is this is a cheap sequel.  Not a lot of discussion, just a lot of (regression) results reporting.  Extremely repetitive.  Moreover, given that this often verves into being fairly social science (as opposed to pop), the causal linkages seem pretty poorly established.  If you want to read this for professional reasons (social science or urban planning), most of this could be ignored; if you want to read this for personal (i.e., recreational) reasons, it's really boring 
 Three Bloody Tales collects the three aborted failures of SH comic writer, Scott Ciencin, into a $20 book printed on good paper.  There's no extras, no explanations of what he or artists Shaun Thomas and Nick Stakal were going for.  It's just a straight reprint of the overpriced TPBs.  The best of the three stories was Grinning Man, and only because it offended me the least.  I love Silent Hill, and the psychological/magical theories that make it such an interesting story locale, but these three stories are simply insulting.    Poorly written, poorly drawn and overpriced.  Hopefully, IDW will put a bullet in this sick dog before it infects someone else 
 I was very disappointed in this movie.  It had such cool cover art on the DVD that I took a chance and rented it - foolish move.  It just isn't scary.  It is a typical slasher type film, but with no scares, storyline, etc..    I watch many, many movies and can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the top 5 worst movies I've seen.  I highly recommend staying clear of this movie 
 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 Tabor does several twists and turns to arrive to the conclusion here, and pieces bits and pieces of a chain to support it.  One chain off and the whole thesis falls apart.  Claims: 1. Jesus wasn't God. 2. Jesus' father was not God OR Joseph. 3. Jesus' father was possibly a Roman soldier named Pantera. 4. Argues that James, the brother of Jesus and Paul were two conflicting versions of Christianity. 5. Paul's "Christianity" won out. 6. Believes on the hypothetical text (Q) being the source of the gospels (yet no archaeological evidence supports it).  And you guessed it, none of the claims have any evidence.  So for a FICTION work, this is great.  For a scholarly, historic work?  The Da Vinci Code was better. 
 I am genuinely surprised by the generally positive reviews of this book; Weaver's unqualified presumptuousness and condescending tone reminds me of the thoughtless media diatribes he supposedly despises. This is not to say that I did not enjoy reading the book, but I enjoyed it mostly because I rarely encounter a book so close-minded that claims to be thoughtful.   The idea that a metaphysical dream which does not transcend particulars will trickle down to the attitudes and actions of everyday life is an assumption. The author commits a similar mistake to those social scientists who construct predictive models on the assumption that all people are rational actors; PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS RATIONAL! I say that Weaver's mistake is similar because his assumption is even greater. It may not be too grievous a generalization that people operate on a daily level acting in corespondence with the logical imperitives of their self interest. For example, the college student who a) wants to be a college professor b) knows that such a career often requires a Ph.D and consequentially c) enrolls in a doctoral program. Judging from this it could be infered that this particular college student is a rational actor. This does not indicate, however, that s/he has a concrete or non-contradictory system of beliefs (let alone metaphysics). She or he could act logically/rationally when it comes to careers yet hold the incompatible beliefs that "there should be complete gender equality" and "only women should raise children". Wasn't one of Plato's main objectives in the Socratic dialogues to show the inherent contradictions in everyone's ideas? In any case I think that practical analysis of Weaver's argument for the metaphysical basis of action is a joke. I certainly don't refer to my dis/belief in universals when I decide to order a cheeseburger.   Even if I were to ignore the enormous assumption noted above, I would still take issue with a serious contradiction in this book. Weaver regularly bashes pragmatism and pushes for a return to the belief in objective truth/reality; he argues (via his big assumption) that if our metaphysics accepted universals we would all act differently and our society would return to the level of order and civility achieved prior to the 14th century. Doesn't that sound like a pragmatic argument in favor of metaphysical revision? Instead of spending time arguing the logical correctness and necessity of universals, Weaver demands that we accept them because doing so will lead to the desired consequences of order and civility. Although he regularly asserts otherwise, objective truth doesn't seem to mean much to Weaver because he approves of it primarily as a means to an end.   I could say lot of other mean things about this book, but I am hoping further criticism is not necessary to deter you from reading it. Not only are Weaver's diagnosis and prognosis for civilization largely useless, but he comes off sounding like a total prude and jackass. 
 This book is difficult and needs better interpretation.  If I thought it was so difficult to read and understand, I wouldn't have bothered to buy.. 
 Cunningham's perseverance, achievements, and conscientiousness are extraordinary, but the writing is average, and the story bogs down as it chronicles Cunningham's career race-by-race in repetitive detail.  As a runner, I tend to enjoy race accounts, but here they lose their drama after awhile--the reader has little reason to care about the outcome of yet another low-stakes event featuring (often) the same participants as previous races.  Unfortunately, the races are the most exciting part of the text throughout much of the book, so it gets just plain boring.  I might recommend skimming it to get a sense of who Cunningham was, but personally I wouldn't spend any money on this book.  
 For $20 I don't even bother to return things, but this article is a disgrace, almost completely useless. Save your money 
 If you are a complete beginner with respect to many of the skills needed for Ajax: HTML, CSS, DOM, JavaScript, then this book might be for you.  All of the O'reilly Head First/Head Rush series are excellent teaching books and do a wonderful job at teaching skills in small bite-size chunks.  Lots of pictures, exercises and games.  This is about as fun as a book can get.  But once you've read the book, you'll realize that you really didn't cover much ground at all.  400 pages of Head Rush Ajax is about the same amount of Ajax technical material as 40 pages of Ajax in Action.  All those fun pictures and games take up a lot of pages!  Only the most basic topics of Ajax are covered.  Much of the book is wasted explaining web-development 101 level subjects...  So it wasn't possible for me to give the book 2 different ratings.  As a pure beginner's book - this is a 4 or 5 star book.  But if you already know HTML, HTTP, DOM, and CSS -- then this book becomes a 2 star Ajax book because it teaches so little about Ajax.       
 Bruce Bawer, Daniel Pipes, Ibn Warraq, and others, have covered the important points with much greater skill and clarity.  And yes, there are important points: the threat of Islamist imperialism is real; the traditional Left's failure to grasp this has had catastrophic results; Eurotrash anti-American and anti-Israeli sentiments are irrational and hypocritical; etc.  Beyond this, Berlinski is so pickled in Republican broth that she cannot stop undermining her own positions.  1. She complains of the urban sprawl and degraded environment of Europe, but wishes Europeans would breed faster. 2. She enjoys the freedom that European secularism gives her (as a secularist of Jewish parentage) but whines that more 'old tyme religion' is needed to counter Islamism. 3. She attributes Marseilles' (relative) freedom from Muslim mob violence to the inclusion of religious councils in city government. But must report the selection of a archetypal fundamentalist imam by the Marseille ummah.  The book appears to have been padded out to its current length, several later chapters are seriously below standard.  For one toothachingly tedious chapter, Berlinski appears to have skimmed Norman Cohn's great work The Pursuit of the Millennium. She manages to miss Cohn's central point--that Medieval Millennialist uprisings were specific to their time and do not support comparisons with Lenin, Luther etc.--and mines the book for examples of anti-clerical/anti-feudal revolutionaries so that she may compare them to a contemporary anti-globalization/anti-American French demagogue.  In addition, we must slog through an entire chapter on the German heavy-metal band Rammstein, so that Berlinski can point out that ... ya know ... Germans are, like ... different. 
  This movie guide is written as if the authors were afraid to offend anyone. Leniency is the key word here. I don't mean to sound cynical, but apparently the authors feel that the best way to help guarantee that people keep purchasing their movie guide year after year is to overrate as many movies as possible. That way, no one's tastes are offended. Clever.  However, judging by the numerous conversations that I've had with a variety of people that have read this book, this scheme seems to have backfired.  People don't seem to think much of it.  As it turns out, movie guide buyers have tastes that are more sophisticated than the authors realize.  They can spot an excessively lenient review, time after time.    I wouldn't waste my time with this book.  It's written for mass market tastes, or what the authors think are mass market tastes, and therefore has no spine 
 This book is horrible.  If I didn't have to read this book for class, I would burn it right now.  It is arguing fiction with nonfiction.  I think we all know machines aren't human!  Don't waste your money unless you idolize Star Trek.  
 The movie manages reasonably well to be objective, although it occasionally leans towards being pro-Coulter, but it's not as black-or-white as Coulter's prose. The problem with the movie is that it's only 37 minutes long and still padded with footage of Ann talking to her mom on the phone and things like that, and it doesn't provide much actual information. It does provide proof of one thing we could already guess about Ann Coulter: She loves to be provocative. She says she loves to get hate mail. It seems like she exaggerates her hatred for liberals in order to be provocative because she's addicted to arguing and debating. And not debating with the intent of reaching any conclusions but debating just for the sake of debating.   So, the film was only mildly interesting, but not worth the price of the DVD. Ann Coulter fans may like the extra material consisting of footage of some of Ann's speeches. This footage runs for about three times as long as the film itself. 
 I am a rock and roll person. I hate rap. This is a rap/pop album that first came out when I was eight; "Steal My Sunshine" was big on my list. That is still a good song, however, I don't really like their other songs. Just buy the single of "Steal My Sunshine"- it will save you money 
 I bought this book in the hope that it could help a pet Bernese puppy buyer with good information.  When reading this book, I felt as if the writer just 'filled in the blanks' of some generic puppy buyer information. This book did not deliver anything I'd hoped for. I consider this book to be a waste of my money and time investment.  I feel there is a much better pet puppy buyer book on the market by Julia Crawford (a longtime Bernese breeder and prior BMDCA President) and the cost is about the same. This better book is called "Bernese Mountain Dog: An Owners Guide to a Happy, Healthy Pet".   I was very disappointed in this book by Amy Christensen. And I hope she'll try again and do a better job next time 
 I am interested in the history of adoption so I read this book.   The hard data from the earlier part of the book was compelling but the general conclusions drawn towards the end read like biased propaganda.  Carp, privy to one state agency's top secret adoption files, makes sweeping generalizations validating across-the-board adoption practice for the nation based on his interpretations of this microcosm.  Also, fairly deadly to read 
 Maybe I should have been more familiar with the Greek tragedy this story is based on?  Frankly, I'm not sure what purpose was served by switching back and forth from Classical Greece to modern day.  What I did like was the very on target insights as to how a gay man feels from adolescence to adulthood.  Personally I think the book would have been just as effective by just keeping it as historical fiction. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book to someone 
 Based on my back-of-the-envelope calculations, this has 37 more short films about Glenn Gould than I'm willing to watch 
 This book may be great, that is if, you are into the technical jargons of photography. I would not suggest this book for a novice, amateur or even semi pro. This book gives me the feeling that the author knew what he was talking about but he just could not but it into Layman's term for you the grasp the idea behind lighting for different projects. I also thought it lacked a great amount of information and studio problem solving techniques 
 There are scholars and there are critics, and then there are enthusiasts: Thomas Flangan falls somewhat into the latter camp. While this collection of pieces on Irish and Irish-American cultural figures he wrote for The New York Review of Books is often quite fine and imaginative, at times Flanagan is severely hampered by his inability to maintain a critical distance from his subjects,  especially when it's someone he greatly admires, like John Ford or James Joyce or F. Scott Fitzgerald. The first two may be worthy of such high and unadulterated praise, but Fitzgerald? Even when dispelling popular myths about the latter, Flanagan has trouble reining in the gush, e.g. on THE GREAT GATSBY's status as a novel about the American Dream, Flanagan writes, "Scholars exchange their learned articles on the subject, and generations of college freshmen are told about it. If you whispered into a reader's sleeping ear the words 'Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY,' she would murmur drowsily, 'and the corruption of the American dream.'"   There's a pretty unhelpful introduction by Seamus Heaney that's more of a personal memoir of Flanagan than a way to orient oneself with regard to Flanagan's writings 
 I have lived in or near several of the places reviewed in this book and find the descriptions to be less than 100% and the weather data to be quite different than I experienced while living there. Since I know the data for these places was less than 'on track', I did not have confidence in the  information presented for other areas of the country. I recommend  "Retirement Places Rated". It seems to present data that agrees  with my experience 
 this movie is trash big time garbage it sucked big time 50cent can not act at all i rather watch my neice act in a grammer school play than watch 50 cent act in this crappy movie it sucked big time he should take more acting classes 50 cent do us all favor bro sticking to raping and give up acting please 50 for the love of god just give up tryin to be the next rapper - actor  just do all a favor  and do not do any more movies ps 8 miles was a lot better movie than get rich and die tryin 50 get lost pleas 
 Dividing classes reaises many questions regarding how the middle class views school advantage.  Through interviews and personal experiences, the author describes her positive and negative experiences with the educational system.  We found this book gives rise to many controversial issues some with which we agree as well as some issues we disagree with.  While the author does give concrete examples, we believe SES is not the only predictor for educational success 
 Lets call this what it is: Lies.  To be more generous, maybe its wishful thinking or a gauzy daydream created by a hopeful, yet intellectually dishonest mind.  As a liberal, sure, it underpinned and gave support to some good movements, but does the ends justify the means?  Or does this kind of fictional writing ultimately undermine the cause?  Weston LaBarre wrote: "When I was a graduate student in anthropology at Yale in the late '30's, Mead's Sex and Temperament came out. Puzzled that even a big island like New Guinea should have had three tribes waiting to be discovered to prove her point about the non-biological nature of gender, I went to Edward Sapir with my puzzlement. He said laconically, 'She's a pathological liar'. I was startled as much by what he said, as by the fact that an eminent anthropologist and chairman of a department should say this to a mere graduate student. But over the years, I have come to believe that this is literally the case." The next round in the evaluation of Mead's anthropology, we may hope, will collect and critically assess this largely unpublished expert opinion. 
 I am no prude but this book was a little too revealing for my taste. It wasn't a classy love story. It was basically pornographic in some parts. And the whining by Kayla. It went on and on. 
 Do you have expensive tastes?  Are you rich?  Childless?  If so, then this cookbook is for you!  I've never even heard of some of these ingredients and the ones that weren't too expensive are nothing that my kids would eat.  In fact, I couldn't find a single thing that my kids would eat, and I don't think the average kid would either.  I think most of these recipes are something only an adult would appreciate.  Well, I guess I can't say that my kids wouldn't like ANYTHING out of this book.  They'd probably like a couple of the dessert recipes.  Check this out from your local library first.  I'm glad I did 
 I have read most of Ludlum's novels, and I usually can't put them down. I found that I was so distracted by the need to correct his grammar, usage, and spelling that I almost didn't finish the book. The story was not bad,  but too contrived even for Ludlum, and not nearly as polished or compelling  as his later novels. Also, of his dialogue was downright embarrassing in  its naive lack of credible inter-sex conversation. Very disappointing for  Ludlum 
 I have all three of the "Verve Remixed" CDs. This one is the worst. On this CD, I just cannot see the point of mangling these old recordings. I found no compelling rhythms at all.   By contrast, the #2 and #3 CDs in the series are great. I find this puzzling. Usually, sequels suck. In this case, the musicheads at Verve seem to have improved their game with practice. I respect them for that. Now I'll just start up Remixed #3 and bliss out for a while 
 If anybody else has read my review for an N'sync album, I stated quite clearly that only 1 good song was on that album. I meant this album.   That still means both albums AND bands suck big time! 
 Let see now, I have Magik 1,2,3,4,5,6, Just Be, ISOS 1,2,3,4, Parade of the Athletes, Summerbreeze, and now Nyana.  You can say I listened to enough  Tiesto in my life to give you my 2 cents worth of an opinion.   I bought Nyana because of so many positive reviews here and Tiesto never let me down, but DOH! Here it is!  Nyana is my LEAST favorite Tiesto CD that I own.  To me it sounds way to monotonous, boring, zero memorable tracks (okay maybe his own Nyana track), gives you that impulsitivity to press the "next track" button on your CD player (Because it's so boring).  I don't know why.  From a  huge Tiesto fan, I do not recommend this CD to be your first Tiesto experience.  Magik series kicks butt! (Esp 4 & 5), and my current all time favorite is ISOS 4. It's rather mellow for Tiesto, but man it is so groovey! :) Bottom line:  Nyana is my biggest disappointment of my TEN Tiesto  CDs I own.  Actually this CD... Stinks!  I am so happy to sell it over Ebay.  Sorry to be honest.  I am now ready to be flamed 
 I'm surprised no other reviewer noticed! Why did Penquin place Ronald Colman and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. prominently on the cover? In this reviewer's opinion, they must secretly realize that the wonderful 1937 classic film vastly outshines the printed word. I found the  story to be poorly written and hard to follow. Its' style is too formal, too flowery and too wordy!	If I had not seen (both) versions of the film, I could not have followed the "action". I constantly referred back to mental images of the movie to orientate myself. A review of "PZ" boils down to a basic truth: While most agree that the book is usually superior, occasionally the movie wins out. "PZ" is a prime example. ("Strangers on a Train" is another!). As for the so -called sequel, "Rupert of Hentzau"- don't even bother, unless you are an Anthony Hope fanatic. Reviewing the book makes one appreciate-once again- that wonderful film fadeout as Ronald Colman rides off over the hill. Since it happens to be available on amazon, click on the movie reviews. Therein will lie the essence of the wonderful adventure story of "The Prisoner of Zenda" 
 I purchased this Westinghouse 37" 1080p monitor (LVM-37W3) because I was very impressed with its ability to be used as both a high-res monitor for work but also an HDTV for play (with an Xbox 360). The product itself is pretty good--the picture is great, colors are wonderful.   But if you have any kind of problem with this product, it is game over. Westinghouse Digital has no online support to speak of. I've sent numerous emails through their site and have received no responses over a month. I finally got in contact with a customer service agent through my extended warranty service and it turns out Westinghouse has NO LOCAL TECHNICIANS to even examine your machine. You have to ship it to them (at your cost) for them to examine, and they said it will take 6-8 weeks or more before they will get back to you. This policy is completely egregious--2 months time to fix a quickly depreciating machine and it costs the customer shipping??   Do a little research and you will see all the customer service horror stories with this product after people have had it for a while.  Go with a real manufacturer with local repair technicians 
 I just wanted to give an update on my progress.  I cannot, with good conscience, support Diane's program any longer.  I am currently weight training, doing cardio, and eating healthy.  Eating healthy is not eating whatever you want.  In 12 weeks, I brought my risk factor for heart disease down from 5.9:1 (which is horrible) to around 3 (which is nonexistent risk).  I did it with exercise and eating right.  I also lost two sizes with just a 12 pound scale loss because I was gaining muscle, too.  To be healthy, you have to work at it!  Sure, you can lose weight eating whatever you want if you eat less - at least up to a point.  But who wants to be a skinny fat woman or a skinny fat man?  Wouldn't you rather be healthy and have a fabulous physique?  Try Body for Life by Bill Phillips.  Also check out the www.bodybuilding.com website for inspiration, education, and good products 
 I didn't like this at all.  I found it chemical, and not nicely redolent of the ginger I O so, love.  I just gave it away, cute little tin and all.  I am adventurous, so I do happen on things I feel aren't what I expected from time to time.  This was certainly one of them.  I'm sure some of you will like like it, don't let me stop you from trying out your own personal tastebuds.  Mine said: "This tea is not a real peach, either. 
 This is the shortest book I failed to finish. I'm sorry, but for a short novel, it was just got too wordy and touchy-feely for me. I loved Emperor of the Air, a collection of short stories in which feelings and places were described succintly. And the events happened at a quicker pace. But in Blue River, Canin stretches out all his descriptions of places, of main character's resentments, disappointments, fears, and memories. It really feels tedious to read and halfway through it, I just had to give up 
 I laughed out loud multiple times reading this book, which is why it took a while for me to realize that "funny lines do not a good book make." The plot is far fetched, the characters are superficial, the "erotica" is crass and amateurish, and the ending is absurd. It barely qualifies as a good beach read, and I felt like I needed a bath upon finishing it. I gave it two stars for the humor. But really--dumb, dumb, dumb 
 I've always held the philosophy you are what you're entertained by. So, those who like Ludacris are definitely telling on themselves about their views of life and women. And speaking of women...Ludacris never met one who wasn't a h-o.  Ludacris is the epitome of the sexual hypocrisy that plagues men: you demean and look down on women for being h-oes, yet you hope every woman is a h-o so you'll have no problems getting laid. But then, you're so disgusted with the fact the woman behaves too much like you, so you go and find a "nice girl" because you can respect her and marry her and procreate with her. But then you cheat on her with a "bad girl" because h-oes need h-oes; but then you can't respect the "bad girl" because she's a slut, so you go back to the "good girl." But she's not nasty enough for you, so then...around and around we go. Women are basically being punished for men not being able to make up their minds about what the heck they want from us.  He's OBSESSED with sex and h-oes. It makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. Maybe Ludapis saw his mother selling herself in a backalley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever. I guess if she had actually RAISED him and shown him how to respect women-- ALL women--then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is.   What's the music like? Well I'll give him 2 stars for mentioning TLC in What's Your Fantasy. That's it.  Addendum: 7/27-07 Some may wonder why I'm "wasting' my time giving Ludacris negative reviews. Well, first of all, if only people who liked the product were the only ones to review it, everything on Amazon would have 5 stars, which would be an inaccurate sign of its quality.   Secondly, I don't like Ludacris. I would give Ludacris more respect if I felt he gave my gender more respect; but he doesn't. My diatribe above shows what my problem with him is, and I feel that argument is valid. There's no way to critique Ludacris' music without critiquing his hypocrisy regarding women. Why should I like him when he seems to have nothing but contempt for us? I'm biased against him because he's biased against me. So he gets a bad rating out of s-p-i-t-e 
 ........from reading Danielle Steel.  Here's the book:  three bachelors meet three women.  They all break up, they all end up happily ever after.  BORING, not one single exciting thing about this book.  I was happy when my lunch break ended so I could go back to work and stop reading.  Yes - we keep reading her because we feel obligated and hope for a better book someday, but I think I'm at the end of my rope with Danielle Steel.  My librarian told me last night they aren't even going to carry any new books of hers.  THAT'S sad 
 I read this book after reading the one published by Golf Digest, since another reader said it was the original work. However, I didn't see that this book was that much different. I do like the notion of a pendulum swing and its simplicity in instruction. However, it is my opinion that golfers today need to have other thoughts as well, such as a firm rear leg against which to turn. When you incorporate the pendulum with other contemporary advice, I think it helps you to extend your arms more for a fuller swing arc. But don't rely on this book alone if you want to advance beyond beginning golf. Look at Humphries' book "Two Steps to a Perfect Swing" if you still want to keep it simple but want to improve. 
 You take a plastic CD, that you spent a good $ 15 on...you're anxious to hear the brutality that your teammates brag of towards this album while hitting the showers.  The open riff is pumping your adrenaline because it sounds like chaos is set to erupt...but instead of hearing a ferocious scream to welcome the evil you get a wimpy sounding " Bring it on " " Yea Boy"!  Yet your amazed! The mainstream follower is shocked!  Why? I'll tell you.  Because they don't know squatt about metal.  It's preppy mainstream excrament!  You'll hear positive reactions from the crowd that think Linkin Park and breaking benjamins are the future of metal!  The people that thought Follow the Leader was the 1st Korn album!  The people that think Godsmack is the music to pump up to before a football game, getting in a fight, or better yet being in the NAVY!  The people who only know these Slipknot songs " wait and bleed ", " Duality " and " Vemillon Pt.1". The people that thought Papa Roach was mosh music!  These are the lifestyles of the upscale who only get influenced by what is broadcasted on modern radio and is too afraid to observe what lies in the underground! I'm talking about a money destroyer! I'll admit myself the music on this album is hard hitting and got some groove.  But that Fred Durst is ruins it!  3 Dollar Bill Y'all ( although a corny title ) was an excellent album for what it is....Significant Other was fair for that time being but the more I listened to it, the more I despised it!  The more Fred Durst opened his mouth, the more I wished for his demise! He is the true definition of a sellout, a joke, and above all a talentless destroyer ( Like Kid Rock ).  If you want to jam to something with a hard hitting heavy sound with hip hop influence?  Get these albums: Hed(p.e.)-Broke Limp Bizkit- Three Dollar Bill Y'all Reveille Darwins Waiting Room Snot- Get Some Slipknot- Self titled EP Anthrax/Public Enemy any Rage Against the Machine or perhaps some old school Beastie Boys! 
 Cheap Trick's second album is very disappointing to me after the good, but raw, "Live In The Studio", 1977-76 recorded Cheap Trick. Almost all of the material here is so watered  down that it REALLY COMES OFF WAY BETTER on the later many  Live disks they did.  After a good start w/ "Hello There", a concert favorite for  many years, is the only thing here to write home about when  one considers how great all the tunes from this overproduced album sounded on the Budokan and other Live recordings later.  Tom Werman and Rick Niesen were on a show in 1991 that I had recorded on a tape once and Werman, noce a friend of Tom Petersson's said, quote: "My three albums with Cheap Trick got better and better...", to which the ever sarcastic Rick Nielsen said, "Selling, maybe." Not realizing that brother Rick was slamming him, Werman then continued, "Exactly"...  Oh boy. We now see why producing Cheap Trick albums through the years has become like playing Russian Roulette. It's not hard to get better than this and five months later the solid, but somewhat oeverrated 'Heaven Tonight' came out...(And the guys EVEN bought Werman back for Dream Police. Things turned  out better when Pete Comita, then later Jon Brant joined the band. Yep - the best was yet to come - in the '80' 
 Unlike everyone else in the world, I did not find this book to be all that great.A guy goes to baseball games or watches them on TV and gives you his side of things.Save yer money and come to my house I can do the same thing. Not much to hold my interest other than watching Tom Seaver play and a few trivial research interests.It is sad to think that this book may have been the book of it's time 
 Can capture analog video and produce cd-rom's but I expected the ability to produce DVD 
 This is my fault im writing this!! I read the reviews for this film before i watched it, and i had seen the tralier but being such a huge fan of Blade 1,2,3 and all his other movies i thought they cant be true!!!!!!    ......how wronge i was:( Theres no need to go all into it, its been done before. Its just bad,so so so bad!! 
 Update: After a few more listens, this album has grown on me some... still far from my favorite but quite enjoyable on its own... -------------------------------------- I put this cd on my wish list after liking every song I had heard by Travis and recieved it for Christmas. The first half of the cd is hard, raw, and practically unlistenable. The 2nd half is mostly ballads but none as good as the new albums. You should listen to some samples of this album to judge for yourself but I really like Travis, but I really don't like this album 
 I have had this sweeper for several months and like others, it's main purpose was to keep my kitchen floor, laundry room, and basement floors clean. Well, it does pick up larger debris best, but when you go for picking up hair, dust and dirt, it blows a lot of it around, not to mention, I noticed that the entire sweeper itself becomes COVERED in dust. Don't buy this sweeper if tou expect it to "suck" things up. It provides NO suction but a motorized brush roll that spins and rolls things up into the dust cup. I recommend this for occasional use for spills like cereal, rice, etc. As far as being a tool to "clean" your floors, you will be quite disappointed. In fact I only use this now to clean my laundry room area and basement floors to pick up debris so it doesn't get tracked in my upstairs 
 While this book contains a wide range of topics of interest to those considering parenthood, it doesn't cover these topics with very much detail.  I would have found it more helpful if the stories of the women interviewed had been longer than a paragraph apiece.  Overall, this book is useful in that it brings up many important issues for consideration, but in my opinion, it served only as a "springboard" for further research 
 Obviously skilled in her practice, the author really gets her hands dirty with this book.  The only problem I have with this book is that, well, I just didn't understand what she was talking about.  I've read many books about general practice and little about theory and, as the name of the book suggests with the inclusion of the word "theory," I expected to learn something about the theory of "witchcraft."  I just didn't.  It seemed like she was trying to be abstract and mysterious while battling the need to be technical and explanatory.  I felt, throughout the book, that she was being creatively fictional (and not the inspirational kind) rather than paying attention to the mission of the book.  Teach the reader about theory in a way that invites the public rather than a way that nurtures a mere minority 
 i purchased this book several years ago and enjoyed it immensely.  and after seeing her on montel williams and hearing her on coast so coast am with art bell, i was completely hooked. what a truly amazing gift she has, right?  i even went as far as booking a reading with her.  the reading came and went. . . and absolutely nothing she said came true.  while the book was a fun read, i learned a rather expensive lesson and will never again waste my money on anything that has to do with sylvia browne.  
 I picked up this book expecting a nice, enjoyable historical fiction- what a dissapointment! If I had such a depraved mind I would certainly not advertise it.  This book is certainly not one to keep around if you have young children who are readers 
 I've been a die hard David Gray fan and waited years for this album. As soon as it was released I got it. First few tracks ok then it takes a nose dive. Some of the tracks are so bad you are left awestruck that David Gray could produce such diabolical quality. I mean the odd track has lyrics that Britney Spears could exceed.  I played it 3 times when I got it, and it is so bad that I would quite happy throw it in the trash can. Because he dared put out such rubbish it has put me off playing all his former (and great) albums.  Be warned. I thought this 6 months back and only posted the review today, so my opinion is solid on this one. And watch the Sony copyright protection and link to fix it does not open your PC to all kinds of problems (have a Google and you will see it is a danger) 
 I read some of the reviews about this book present on this site and was somewhat surprised to see mostly positive ones. Maybe it is just my perception or the expectation I had after reading these reviews but before buying the book that lead to my disappointment in the book. What were my expectations...? I did expect Galen to tell me what he thinks and feels before, during, and after taking those great pictures. I did NOT expect a HOW-TO book (which it is definitely not). I expected a book about artistic approach to the outdoor photography. What I found instead was mostly a travel log. The first 2 chapters were as close to my expectation as it ever got. The author talked some about his creative approach and very little about his technical one. The rest of the book doesn't even present his "photographic philosophy". He simply talks about his travels, places he visited, people he met. All that would be great for an illustrated travel book but not for a book that was supposed to tell me about how HE came to those pictures, what (in his opinion) made those pictures great or standing out (there is some of it but so little it almost doesn't exist). The book's title has "inner game" words in it. I wanted to know what that "inner" game was before, during, and after taking EACH picture (or at least most of them). Overall - disappointing and expensive for that 
 This adventure of Cheech & Chong see's them playing a couple of dudes who work for some Arab dudes who like want them to drive a car from Detroit to Las Vegas but they have no idea why, they just wanna get paid for the job. Theres a lot of things happening to them as the drive from one place to the other.   There isnt much of the Stoner Humor in this one compared to other C&C movies. The laughs arnt there as strong as the other either, but the humour is still defintly there. I have a feeling Richard "Cheech" Marin probably wanted to show he could act as something other then the Cheech charactor, they play a couple of Arabs in the movie aswell, and lean more towards a humor not so pot headed. I think Cheech was trying to establish himself as a real actor. But least he stayed true to Cheech tho, he didnt kill the charactor or anything.  I'd say this is the weakest of all the C&C movies. I even think Get Out Of My Room is funnier then this... but dont count it out tho, it's still got some great bits in it.... my fav is when Cheech needs to go to the bathroom and ends up going a way he didnt expect.  There's no bonus features or anything which is a bummer. Seems the only one to get any attention has been the first movie... if there not going to give these things extra features, then they should have at least made the DVD a double feature with Nice Dreams (Columbian release's, thats why that particuler title)  We need a new Cheech & Chong movie, this may be the weakest, but it's still better then most of the stoner movies being made these days, thats why we need Tommy and Richard to make a new one to show the kids today how it's done 
 The iRock's sound quality is on par for most of these FM transmitters, they all sound bad. I was aware of the sound limitations when I bought the iRock, my big issue is the design and placement of the power button. It is set up in such a way if you put it in your glove box (or just about anywhere) you can guarantee something will press the power button and run down the batteries. Very frustrating. The iRock also limits you to only four station radio choices, 88.1, 88.3 etc. Since I live in Boston, a fairly large city with many, many colleges, those frequency are being used. So the iRock is useless for me when I am downtown. As soon as I get out of the city I'm fine. There has to be a better unit out there 
 In the picture and discriptions on Amazon I feel I was missled I thought is was a nice big book with nice pictures, or at least thats how they made it seem. When I got it it was just a tiny little black and white book with drawings of braids.                       good luck          I will continue to shop at Amozo 
 I really enjoyed The Perfect Storm.  So, I gave Ms. Greenlaw the benefit of the doubt and started her book.  I was less than impressed.  I lasted till page 53 where I just ran out of patience with her plodding technique and her lack of story. This is a bad book attempting to ride on the tail of Junger's book.  Sebastian Junger's blurb on the cover was "Anyone who loves the sea will love this book"  I think not 
 Because there were so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to go out and rent this film and watch it.  I was bored to death watching this film, and whats with the words "what's wrong" kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice?  Those words and that voice really annoyed me!  Why does this place have not one person with hair?  Now, I'm not trying to be raciest here, but what's with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t.v., well  I can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up.  What's with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate?  Was he supposed to be gay?  I guess this film is way to so called "artsy" for me.  What I know is that this film is boring, and when it comes to ending, you don't know what happends to the guy at the end.  The film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway.  This film makes the movie The Village exciting to watch.  I wish that I could give my money back 
 I have most of EJD's books and I was definitely not impressed with this one. It actually took me a little over a week to finish it which is unheard of with me and my beloved EJD books. I'm just not feeling this one but I still buy the hardcover out of loyalty and because a bad EJD book is better than a whole lot of other garbage out there that's disguised as "good" fiction.   EJD chose to write a plot involving scams, murder and suspense like he did with "Thieves Paradise," wish was not my favorite either. The main character Driver gets caught up with married lover Lisa. She is a psycho to the tenth power. Reading about how she kept up with Driver's every move just made me shudder to think how easy it is for a person to stalk you if they choose.   I like that the backdrop is Los Angeles. Although EJD is not originally from Los Angeles, he's lived there long enough to have effortlessly captured in his novels the love-hate relationship you can easily develop for this city. You can't really describe it, you just have to live there to understand and appreciate his descriptions. I do like the appearance of characters from his previous books such as Arizona, Pam, and Panther. I'll admit Rufus was funny for words. The twists and turns of the story was okay but when it came to the end of the story I couldn't care less what happen just as long I was done.     The good news is that I am ready for another dose of EJD. The man is a great author who really takes the time to write books that the majority of black people can relate to in one way or another. Like I said earlier suspense novels are fine but I'm hoping the next one goes back to his roots and deals with relationships. 
 I hope I get program to receive it next month  Patty Jone 
 (Sigh.)  It sure would be nice if for once we could get a truly open-minded, evenhanded book on any paranormal topic.  The problem is that knee-jerk reactions tend to be the rule.  On the one hand there are the True Believers, those who uncritically and unthinkingly accept the existence of extraterrestrials whizzing through our skies, occasionally abducting folks when the fancy takes them.  On the other hand there are those who portray themselves as sensible, level-headed skeptics. But often these debunkers are just the other side of the coin.  True Unbelievers, I call them.  If the True Believers have a blinkered view of things, ignoring or giving short shrift to evidence that runs contrary to their beliefs, the same can often be said for people like James Randi and the whole CSICOP crowd in general. And Kal Korff particularly.  In fact Korff's book, with its smugly juvenile writing characterized by overheated prose filled to the brim with eccentric punctuation, especially extreme overuse of exclamation points, is remarkably similar in style to what you see in True Believer crackpot literature.  Look, I can understand the need to approach such a sensational story as the Roswell incident with a good dose of healthy skepticism, but you really have to be kidding yourself at some level if you claim to find most of Korff's arguments at all convincing.  Basically, his  explanation for the stories told by approximately 100 or so first- and second-hand witnesses is that they're all liars.  Now which idea is more far-fetched, the crash of a craft of unknown origin or a town that inexplicably breeds and/or attracts pathological liars?  Especially where the liars' stories all basically gibe.  Either one sounds like the basis of a Stephen King novel to me.  "Ah-ha!!!" exclaims Korff, saliva spraying from his mouth.  "Perhaps the stories DO gibe *basically*, but that's the problem!!  When it comes to details there are any number of contradictions between them!!!   How can you possibly explain such a thing, eh??!!!! Case closed!!! Ha!!!!"  Well, Kal, I don't know where you get the idea that human memory acts as an objective recording device like a video camera.  It's well known that if you gather together a group of people who have witnessed a traffic accident and interview them separately, you will get plenty of contradictions in their stories.  Korff expects absolute perfect agreement between scores of people, all of whom are elderly folks describing their recollections years after the fact.  I'm not saying that Korff doesn't have a few good points, but he doesn't come close to demolishing the Roswell "myth."  If you're looking for a better-reasoned, better-written anti-Roswell book, you should probably check out Philip Klass's.  But also read one of Kevin Randle's books.  You'll see that good arguments can be made both pro and con on Roswell if you truly look at it with an open mind 
 Community Playhouse in Long Beach did the show this August. As it played, the plot didn't come through, but the wit of Shaw did. The playhouse didn't have the costumes of the military men, nor the actors to carry-off the pomp and bravado of these would-be heroes. In a time when G.W. Bush is fighting his own phantasmic enemies this play should have lapooned the whole spectre of military madness. George Bernard Shaw gave us the theme it will take some imagination and talent to make it contemporary and equal to the madness of our times. Ano 
 Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America. Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans. Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion 
 Not only are the things listed in this book cheap trinkets but most everything in the book you have to pay $1.00 or $2.00 for. The stuff you do not have to pay shipping for are useless pamphlets and literature. There are a few things that are pretty cool and possibly some useful information for some folks but most everything is Junk. Plus a lot of the things listed are repeated through the book. Its like the author needed to add stuff and thought nobody would notice that several of the things were repeated. Overall this 31 page booklet was not worth the paper it was printed on. If you are interested in getting free things I would suggest finding "freebie" message boards on the internet 
 The main problem with this book is that the content is totally unrelated to the title. The title puts forth that the book will discuss how marketing has affected American culture, but the book constitutes no such treatise. Instead, the reader is assaulted with a series of the author's autobiographical vignettes. Despite Seabrook's best efforts to tie these together with the occasional sentence or two about marketing, the tales remain disjunct. Further, they're totally uninteresting! I kept reading in the hope that the book would match up to the promise of its cover description, but it never did. What a waste of money and time. 
 If it were possible to give this movie zero stars, i would have. Although it may have won an Academy Award and been considered great in it's day, it is now outdated and boring. Unless scenes of teenagers trying to have sex with anyone are interesting to you, then maybe you will find it interesting. When i say anyone, i do mean anyone. The main chracter, Sonny, who is a teenager sleeps with Ruth, wife of his footbal coach and the young girl, Jacy, sleeps with her mother's lover on a pool table. The film also attempts to bring up homosexuality but keeps it muted. You would think a movie called "The Last Picture Show" would be more about a picture show but it really has very little to do with the movie. There is some nudity which was huge for the time of it's release since it was practically unheard of. The film is also completely in black and white which was a choice of the director so the film could give a better feel of the time period, 1950's. This movie also gives a bad impression of those who live in the country, making them look like they are so bored of their desolate surroundings that they must seek sex with anyone who is willing. If this movie would have been made in present day, it would be your typical porn movie but since none of the sex scenes are actually shown they just show the faces and i guess that is what it allows it to be called an "award winning movie" and not a porn. Also if you think the movie was bad, try reading the book it was based off of, much worse 
 I had liked The Mother of All Pregnancy Books and decided to try this one. But I don't find it nearly as complete or helpful as "What to Expect the Toddler Years". I haven't read it cover to cover, but so far I find that the sections don't delve deeply enough into topics or offer unique suggestions/advice 
 If I had not had to read this book for a class on Weddings, Marriage, and Family: A Feminist Perception, there is NO way I would have ever had bought this book.  Ms. Ingraham wants half the world's population to not marry AT ALL.  Yes, there are excellent issues she brings up regarding sweatshops, racism, corporate greed, etc., but to deny a little girl a dream of wanting to be a princess for a day is ridiculus!  She uses weddings and marriage interchangeably which gives a wrong impression.  This book was the last straw for my EVER wanting to take another feminist course in college 
 This was a required text for my accounting class. Let's just say, if you're not familiar with accounting, or not fond of it, this text will make you hate it even more! Be careful because I somehow received the loose leaf edition of it and had to place it in my own binder.. 
  How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s.  He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart.  Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: "How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man." (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.  Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, "If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose." The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: "This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities." How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem.  "Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man." (p. 147). He does not forget that this "education" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. "Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant." (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity.  "It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society." (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society. Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm: Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards,  Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.   Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:  Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.  I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?  Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity.     
 I've read many of the reviews of the sorely disappointed, and I understand their complaints since I've also experienced many of the same problems.  There are, however, some workarounds that might help some of the stuckees...  Regarding too-high-gain leading to static, I've learned through trial and error that the not-so-SmartDeck volume is fairly random due to variations in mechanical position of its head relative to the tape deck head.  If  the volume is set too high (or low), try plugging the SmartDeck in and out a few times, or reach your finger in and see if you can jiggle its position.  Picking an especially loud song while you do this will help you to know when you have successfully adjusted to a good volume.  Unfortunately, this workaround doesn't work for all iPods... although I can always successfully find a good position with my 4th generation 40GB iPod, I've noticed that the output from the iPod mini is significantly louder, and therefore, much harder to adjust this way.  Regarding the tapedeck-spits-out-SmartDeck problem, I've noticed that I only get this problem when the SmartDeck is cold, usually first thing in the morning (clearly, this is the tape deck thinking the SmartDeck is a jammed tape).  Try warming the SmartDeck by blowing warm breath into the hole where the fake "tape" is, then put it back in.  In cold weather, the deck itself is also going to be cold, so you may have to do this several times until the entire car warms up.  It seems to me that this problem has become less pronounced over time -- I rarely have to do this more than once nowadays.  Unfortunately, I don't have a workaround for the intermittent track-skip/FF problem.  I have seen that once or twice, though in general, that feature tends to work for me (both track skip, and track FF/Rewind).  I have a suspicion that this is another cold weather problem and a side effect of the spits-out-tape problem, but now that I have a workaround for the latter problem, I've not seen this problem in over a year.  Ironically, if you manage to avoid all these warts, the SmartDeck is the best-sounding adapter I've ever heard.  Plus, the auto-on/off feature is much more valuable than you might think (and no one seems to complain that this feature is broken). With the four other adapters I've tried -- two cassette, and two FM transmitter -- I cannot tell you how many times I forgot to turn my iPod off when I exited the car, then came back to a dead iPod.  Nevertheless, the warts are pretty obnoxious, therefore I must deduct 3 stars from this otherwise 5-star product 
 I feel I must be missing something as there are so many positive reviews for this book. I did not even finish it. All of the reviews say it is smart and funny. I suppose I'm not bright enough and don't have the sense of humor it takes to appreciate this book. To me, it appears to be nonsensical stream of consciousness dribble. Just writing with no real clear direction or organization. I am a fan of Vonnegut's other works. Unfortunately, this one was not for me. I'm not sure what others saw in it that I didn't. Maybe they're just very loyal to Vonnegut. I don't know. I cannot recommend this book. 
 I bought the book because I liked the title but was very disappointed. The book has too many animals and baby blankets and few really  clothes for children. The title promises more. I have knitted one of the sweaters, but I am not inspired to knit anymore from this book. The layout could have been good if the drawings had been better. Gret 
 Don't buy this book.  You need to be a surgeon to be able to remove the stickers from the sticker pages.  You then have to search endlessly with your child to find the proper location for it.  There are many other more enjoyable options that do not provide as much frustration as this product.. 
 This book was downright awful. I was not able to even finish reading the last few chapters. It is really frustrating that the books (after Obsidian Butterfly) have a crime scene at the very beginning of the book, which misleads the reader to believing that there is going to be an action-packed, rich story with amazing characters to follow and mysteries to solve. Do not get your hopes up !!! Anita is so busy having sex with anything with a pulse , that there is no space for anything else. The woman is sexually frustrated.  I truley miss the "old", the real Anita Blake series. She was such a strong character, taking no nonsense from anyone. Someone who had her priorities fully sorted out. The main men characters were strong-minded and actually had a personality. Now they are only lining up to see who is going to get jumped next, when she gets "hungry" again.  Even after reading these last horrible books, I am still hoping for a miracle to happen...... book 15, The Harlequin is going to be published soon, and I am hoping that the author at least tried to save the series !! 
 You pay almost twice the price that you pay for other DVD burners. Then you waste four or five DVD's before you find out by doing Internet research that it will not burn "unsupported" DVD media at highest speed. Of course, burning software should tell you that or adjust the burning speed for successful burn. However, that is too much to ask from free Roxio software that Plextor will give you. It is bad engineering on Plextor's part that they will even not bundle a single sheet of paper, saying up front that what media the burner will support 
 This book is a feeble attempt to promote a philosophy that is contradictory to conventional judaeo-Christian values and tenets upon which this country was founded. The author has the brazen supremist attitude that her beliefs must be imposed upon other more rational Gof-feaing Americans. If she is unhappy with the progress and direction the country is taking she should buy a one way ticket back to he homeland. This country was built upon the idea that we are blessed compared to all other countries. The measures she is promoting we introduce into our society are in opposition to the views and ideals shared by the majority of the citizens of this country. She argues that we abandon our values and replace them with her heretical beliefs and standards. What a self-centered, empty person who is bereft of any sense of values. This book wreaks of a disconnect with the sensibilties of what made our country a model for all others 
 We used a previous version of this book when my first child was applying to colleges in 2003, and found it helpful. The current edition was a disappointment because of obvious errors. In addition to the Stanford error, the Northwestern evaluation was completely illogical. After stating that Northwestern is "one of the most academically rigorous (schools)in the country,"with an "applicant pool that is easily among the best in the country," the book gives an academic rating of 77. That is the same rating given, for example, to St. Bonaventure University, which ranks high on the "lots of hard liquor" and "students almost never study" lists.  It is interesting to note that three years ago, Northwestern topped the "best overall academic experience for undergraduates list" with an academic rating in the high 90's.  It is now ranked more than 20 points lower. Since both reviews cannot possibly be correct, one is forced to conclude that the authors are either biased or careless. I was left feeling that I could not trust the data presented, and will be using a different book for reference when my second child applies to college 
 I can see this book really knocking the socks off of a Photoshop neophyte with little to no understanding of image processing fundamentals or color spaces, but if you've ever done anything more complicated than pasting your co-worker's head on a celebrity's body and typing some hilarious text underneath it, there's really nothing worth spending money on here. Mr. Margulis has taken a tiny handful of incredibly rudimentary and well-known retouching techniques and padded them out with a Herculean dose of narcissism in order to make himself sound like some sort of pioneering genius. His tone is grating to an extreme and as others have said, there's probably about ten pages worth of genuinely good information in the entire book.   Yes, Lab mode is there. Yes, it makes certain calculations simpler. Yes Photoshop uses it as its default profile connection space. But guess what, Lab has a great many flaws as well, and these flaws continue to drive the CIE to create successors such as Luv, LCh and xyY. And of course we can't forget about the good old faithful XYZ space which probably deserves to be touted as "the most powerful colorspace" at least as much as Lab does. Why hasn't Mr. Margulis written a book about that?  Probably because he has little to no idea what he's talking about and is just parroting material he's read on various free websites over the years.  Do a Google search on "Lab Color" and/or get yourself a book on color management if you want to learn something other than cheap parlor tricks. Round-tripping your images to Lab and back unnecessarily is one of the best ways to destroy whatever color fidelity they might have had, especially if you take Mr. Margulis' advice and throw half your capture data away just because you want to rebel against convention by disregarding things like easily demonstrable facts. In Mr. Margulis' world, photographers make such perfect exposures every single time that they have no need of higher bit depths or non-destructive editing features. Of course, if this were actually the case, they'd have no need of a book about fixing imperfect exposures, either. 
 I've been reading several books lately on American armor in the European theatre of WWII. This was the least interesting. The pictures are all of restored vehicles standing in museums or vacant lots. The information is mostly boring stuff about where it was manufactured, the type of engine, etc. There is nothing very relevant to how the tanks were used in combat. Books such as "Patton's Tank Drive" and "Patton and the Battle of the Bulge" provide much more interesting info and pictures 
 A good number of suicides are financially related and people that are stuck in catch-22's.  We have excessively rich people in our society that do jack all to help eliminate suicides that are financially related, yet they can line the pockets of politicians with millions.  Yet everyone and their mother can spend a few bucks on lottery tickets that the lotto collects to give to the lucky winner(s).  We live in a sick society, the only way anyone is going to solve suicide is to acknowledge there are many causes of it and that in some rare circumstances suicide is a rational and final option after all avenues have been exhausted.  But most suicides fall under:  1) Financial circumstances one cannot escape from that was not purposely brought upon oneself (i.e. debt due to loss of job rather then it being self caused by being a spendthrift) 2) Circumstances of ones own biology and neurology which effects how long one can keep a job, if able to function in one at all.  Which causes #1, and the downward vicious cycle. 3) Parental abuse or negligence while growing up 4) Crises of expectations/a life of bad experiences, one after the other for an extended period of time that re-enforces the notion that nothing is going to get better. 5) Acute lonelyness, lack of love, self hatred, and body image (if one was born severely ugly/disfigured, etc) 6) One has ones quality of life significantly reduced in extremely significant ways (i.e. become disabled, disfigured, loss of limbs, etc) 
 I wonder whether Terry Goodkind has fallen into the Anne Rice and JK Rowling trap of selling so many books that editors don't dare to interfere with them anymore. Any sane editor would have told Terry Goodkind to cut about 200 pages of this novel. Cutting the endless speeches and repetition of the same points over and over again might have helped make this book somewhat up to the standards Mr. Goodkind has set by the previous books of the series (except Pillars of Creation, which, frankly, I skipped). The narrative is long-winded, the endless exposition is tiring and the repetition of Richard's - questionable - moral lesson at every given chance sinks the book in a quagmire of all talk and no action. The plot is ridiculous, and the final resolution cheap and lazy.  I must confess I'm growing tired of the way Goodkind writes Richard and Kahlan. He underuses the latter and makes the former into a terribly boring stiff. Where's the spark?  Somehow the air's gone out of Sword of Truth somewhere in the second half of Faith of the Fallen, and I only hope Goodkind will get it back to finish off the series as strongly as it's started. 
 Welcome to the incredibly boring world of the Mississippi Valley.  If you have to read this book, the last paragraph of each chapter will sum everything up for you.  There is also a ten page summary at the end of the  book!  So if this is required reading, don't sweat it.  You can get  everything you need out of this book in ten minutes!  Please don't waste  your time reading the entire book 
 I found Dorrell's frequent asides about his personal experience as a struggling gallery owner to be self-indulgent and unnecessary. Some of these sections got almost too personal. Dorrell's overall tone was jaded, then  self-congratulatory on his finally realized successes. I also found that his advice was exactly contrary to that of another writer of a book I found on this site. I recommend "How to Survive and Prosper As an Artist" by Caroll Michels instead of this book. I think Michel is far more upbeat and serves the interest of the the reader/artist; whereas Dorrell thinly disguises his self-interest as a gallery owner 
 This book, after the opening tour through england, leaves us with nothing to capture about the NSA. He writes well as a university student. But his research could have been obtained in a salon reading Bamford's books; nothing new. I was surprised when nothing is said of Israel's communication links, or with Britain's, since he alludes to MI 5 frequently, conduct in Ireland. Much is missing from this first book...it may help with his tuition with his timing 
 The author of this trash wants to lecture Americans for their heavy-handed foreign policy, but at one point says that America hasn't been a good colonial master. This, coming from a country that gave us the occupation of China?  Then he proceeds to chide Americans for not dropping the atomic bomb on Germany in 1945, conveniently forgetting the reason - that the atomic bomb wasn't tested until July, 1945, and Germany surrendered in May of that year. Duh.  Frankly, if I'm going to be lectured, I'd like to be lectured by someone who has a clue what he's talking about 
 With each book she writes, Jodi Picoult comes down a level in terms of quality.  Rather than narrowing the scope and developing it well, this novel is a pinball machine of ideas, people and issues that never come together.  I kept holding out for an ending that would redeem the rest of the story but was disappointed till the final word 
 As a collector of Toy books I thought "elements of Pop Ups" should be in my collection.... save your money for the real books, even at the discounted price of $28 dollars I would do better tearing up much cheaper books and learning from them than from this.    We that like the Pop ups are supposed to be brothers but this is an outrageous price for so little work 
 Well, the title says it all.  Where was the editor on this?  The first rule of writing is always to keep your reader's interest.  I think major points of the book could be made less often to reduce repetitiveness.  And less written on points that are kind of obvious - like "Taxes impair wealth accumulation."  I tried reading just the summaries, but the book is more than just that.  I got it out of the library, but I ran out of renewals.  Even so, the ideas are VERY important to consider, so everyone should make an attempt at it 
 I bought this product no long ago.  It never works.  Mice still jump around, and even make noise.  I call the company.  They don't have technical report.  The product manual says, once mice get used to the ultrasound, it will not work.  I never heard about this from other company.  This company is very bad.     
 I've sat in front of this book for a week, barely making a dent in it.  Flanner purports to tell the story of French culture, but succeeds only in revealing that she is a socialite concerned only with the deaths of famous authors. The book is organized into one-paragraph snippets summarizing the latest death, of Lindbergh or Monet, for instance.  However, instead of reflecting the culture of Paris in the era, Flanner simply summarizes the lives of her subjects.  Her description of Monet ends, as do many, with a count of how many people attended his funeral. Simply put, the book reads like the journal of a socialite who is out of touch with common culture.  It is not interesting neither literarily or historically 
 This is the weakest book Mr. Marquez ever wrote-a living proof that autobiographies written by the writers are sentimental drag. His usual style of fantastic truth and romatic albeit very sad fantasy is nowhere to be found. If you love Marquez, do not read this book 
 I've been a longtime fan of Seagal's movies, but I was greatly disappointed by this film.  First, there were clearly sections where Steven Seagal's voice was done by a different actor who sounds nothing like him. (Clearly done when the film was cut together after the main filming) It was surprising that they could not take the time to get Seagal to do the vocal tracks for those sections.  There were also very few action sequences that demonstrated Seagal's skills with martial arts.  In many ways, this film was more of a slasher flick than an action film. Little action, but lots of bloody corpses lying about.  I enjoyed Black Dawn far more, and feel it was a much better made film 
 This book is very comprehensive, which is either a blessing or curse depending on your background. As someone who knew nothing about Islam prior to reading this book, I was frequently overwhelmed by the mass of information that Lapidus has arranged. As you may notice by the sheer volume of this 970 page book, it is VERY wordy. Like most history texts, it is also very dry and devoid of emotion. The author does, however, provide a complex view of Islam that is fair and accurate 
 Although Biech makes a number of good points in her text here, the vast majority of it can be chocked up to common sense. The workbook fill-in forms are nice if you're the sort of person that is so unorganized that you need your hand held at every step, but in all honesty if you fall into that category you probably shouldn't be thinking about a consulting career in the first place. Unfortunately I feel like their primary purpose is just to take up space, and make the book feel longer and more useful than it really is. If you boil this "quick start guide" down to the few pages that are actually worthwhile, you wouldn't even have enough pages to fill a pamphlet. Look elsewhere 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 My mother and father read this book and it enflamed them against the doctors who were trying to convince my mother that she needed to do something about her Stage II breast cancer.  She was scared to death by what she read.  Perhaps literally.  While she was scared, her cancer progressed to Stage IIIC.  We're not sure she's going to make it.  She received three opinions regarding recommended treatment from some of the best hospitals/doctors in the U.S.  Then the cancer spread to her breast bone area.  She is finally following doctors orders, including chemo, and her tumors are shrinking.  We pray it is not too late.  I'm sure this book has some useful information, but my mother only showed me the scary bits--the things that made her wait.  Too long?  Who knows.  Beware 
 Bought DVD mainly cos am a Alyssa Milano fan but to be honest she was completely wasted in this film. Quite a good story but seemed to have a really rushed ending. Probably an ok television movie to watch on a rainy day and worth getting just to have a laugh at the acting from the guy who plays Benedict. If your an Alyssa fan stick with Charmed 
 Bought this radio to use in a high rise office building.  Radio' AM tuner unable to receive signal through the building walls / structure.  Works great, if outdoors 
 I am an avid reader and a lover of books.  I will generally read anything cover to cover, whether I am enthralled in the story or forcing my way through the end of an awful yarn.  I couldn't even finish this book.  It was HORRIBLE!  I had prepared myself for a hilarious adventure (such as any of Douglas Adams' books) and instead got a disgusting, boring set of chapters that seem to have been forced onto the page by an immature, high school drama student.  Don't even bother with this book.  You'll be disappointed 
 I chose this book because the premise was intriguing. Andrea Waggener, however, has much remedial work to do before she can overcome the shortcomings of this debut novel. Her grammar and vocabulary are atrocious. The characters are poorly conceived; their behavior and language are stilted. Her descriptions of settings, clothing, food, flowers, furniture, and so forth could have been better executed by a third grader. No solution is really achieved for any problem and foolish subplots are introduced and then left to languish without resolution. But by far the worst failing of the book is the author's attitude toward the overweight. Waggener's descriptions of her oversized protagonist, Ronnie Tremayne, and her contemporaries are laced with references to their clumsiness, rolls of fat, ill fitting clothing, and waddling gaits. Ronnie herself is crippled by poor self-esteem, frustration, and depression much of the time, no matter which universe she finds herself in. She is passively buffeted from one situation to another and rarely takes responsibility for her own emotions or circumstances. I was embarrassed for the characters by Waggener's hostile, condescending attitude toward them. The author, a former full figured gal herself, should be ashamed 
 The main argument of the book is simple: as countries go from dictatorship to democracy things get worse before they get better. This has been a central argument of political science, and Mr. Bremmer neither acknowledges what others have said nor does he add much to them. All he book has to say comes in the first ten pages. After that it is snipets of histories of countries which do not add much 
 At $15.95, this is an outrageous rip-off!  The impressive-looking cover image looks like a book, but it only an envelope which contains five LEAFLETS!  They look like the attraction-folders one sees around to be picked up for free.  While the maps are clear, the points of interest listed are described in a few words or short sentences.  You'll get abundantly more information with a book of guided walks.  Don't get suckered in to this excessive price 
 I do not recommend this book unless you are more interested in a technical history rather than a layman's history.  It may make a good textbook, but it is not exciting to read 
 This book is a marketing scam. It's got pretty photos, but all the cookies I made were failures. I ended up throwing out at least 3 batches from different recipes. I'm an accurate cook, and after following the recipes from this book, they came out absolutely inedible!!! Not even my sweet obssessed kids would eat them. I had to write this to warn others not to buy this book. Stick to recipe books that have been well received with tested recipes and written by well-known cooks 
 Maybe the author wrote this book as part of his therapy.  It could have been such a nice book.    To read about something as idiotic as putting a small dog and a weasel into a barrel and closing the lid until one killed the other is just too much.  The dog is the one left alive, but has been hurt so badly they have to shoot it in the head.  Then there is the pig mating scene.  Yes, we all know "it" happens, but my child does not need to read about "thrusting" and blood running down the gilt's leg.  The boar owner makes a comment that the next time the gilt will stand still for it.  Great message for young girls.  When I asked children what they remember about the book, they tell me the above stories.  One did not even remember the boy's father dies, but remembered the above graphic situations.  Much is lost on them.    The graphic situations ruined what could have been a good book 
 I read the first two chapters, scanned the rest, and decided not to waste any more time; there are too many good books to read. The premise of the writer (de Becker) is that intuition is correct where rational thought fails. He tells the stories of the lady who was attacked in a dark parking lot, the lady whose boy died during an operation, and the one whose son was getting a lot of attention from a pervert. In every case the lady had reason to fear for her or her boy's safety before a bad thing happened. To de Becker, each tale is proof that intuition was right and reason went wrong. The author does not cite his sources, but makes it clear that he is the world's foremost consultant, and gets these stories from people who attend his lectures and TV appearances (on Oprah!). The book might be better if it was all stories, but it is padded out to 321 pages with a lot of hot air. It never happens that anyone is taken by surprise, or has an unfounded suspicion. Becker gives us a slanted, unbalanced view, in trying to ratify the bold claims on the book jacket (how to know if every person your child will ever meet is a threat). The evidence is cooked. The thesis must be rejected. I offer the alternate hypothesis that de Becker pads his pockets selling bogus books to gullible parents. 
 This book is perhaps the most disgusting display of blatant prejudice I have ever witnessed in a work of fiction. I don't believe Mr. Caldwell could possibly have interacted on any personal level with any of the people whom he so cruelly and stereotypically portrays. As a resident of the South, I have had literally thousands of narratives of the Great Depression passed down to me through family and friends. None ever reflected anything in the realm of this book. "Tobacco Road" reflects a view that poverty equals inhumanity, and this could not be farther from the truth. As social parody this book is almost entertaining--but taken as seriously as the tone of the writing encourages, it is ludicrous.  
 This book certainly did not live up to the advertising copy I found on Amazon.com. I found this book to be very poor in terms of usefullness of the contents. It was all fluff and appeared to be aimed, at best, toward management level people who don't have the competence to make factual based decisions on equipment purchases. It not only did not provide facts or data, it didn't provide many clues about how someone trying to make a decision would go about fact based decision making with respect to EDM. The text was highly repetitive in nature. I found its strong advocacy of relying on the manufacturers of equipment for everything from operations knowledge to purchasing evaluation, to be insulting to my inteligence 
 I guess I'm in the minority here - but I really didn't care for this movie. The irony was pretty striking...in parts of the movie, you are reminded of the post 9-11 climate and the sacrifices others have made for our freedom.  Then you have a lead character like Monty that is completely unlikeable and undeserving of the breaks he has received.  It was hard to feel any empathy for him (even saving the dog wasn't enough for me).  Here is somebody who has made poor choices and is now getting punished for it.  But what does the movie do? 99% of the supporting characters feel sorry for Monty and whine about how it isn't right that he is going away. He never acknowledges what he did was wrong, he seems to feel bad that he got caught, that's all.   To me, it looks like Spike Lee wanted to support his hometown after 9-11 and rushed this movie into production.  Even though the parts were well acted by all, they were still unrealistic, unlikeable characters with a fragmented, slow plot.  I enjoyed Lee's films "Do the Right Thing" and "Bamboozled" much more.  
 Our dogs didn't even notice it.  We have three small terriers and I thought this would be a suitable device for a few house slippers.  I was wrong - the kept on barking.. 
 Read the info about this product carefully.  This listing is not for kitchen scissors, but rather poultry shears.  Chef's choice does make the 8" kitchen scissors in the picture, but that is not what you will get if you order these.  I had these on my wishlist and my brother ordered them for me for christmas.  I am now returning the poultry shears to amazon 
 My local radio morning show was raving about this book, so I just had to order it.  What they didn't mention was that this book is FULL of the "F" word, and many of the notes are very sexually explicit.  May be a selling point for some, but not for me.  I just received it today, and it's now in the recycle bin.  Was going to give it to my husband for Christmas...glad I opened it first 
 I admired Lutz's throughness in accruing examples, and there are many interesting sidebars and historical illustrations, but there's almost no point to this book at all. It reads somewhat like Marjorie Garber's latest  works, except it's even more "lite"--it's as if he had been so  busy finding things to discuss relative to tears that he forgot to spend  time actually discussing what sorrow and sentiment and sentimentality  actually mean 
 I haven't read many books written by Patterson but I liked The Notebook so I thought I would read some of his other publications.  I didn't find much to like about At First Sight.  The story is totally unbelievable and the characters one-dimensional. It is a boiler plate romance novel. The couple are immediately attracted to each other but something keeps them apart. A wave of a wand and they both know they love each other. The happy couple then find and overcome adversity.   Patterson is not a bad writer. If you are looking to escape from the daily grind and want to find romance in an easy read, you won't be disappointed.  If you want a realistic story and believeable characters, then At First Sight isn't for you 
 My brother, the uncle of my two sons, purchased this item for Christams.  In the excitement of testing this item out they realized the battery backing was not able to be opened.  The screw casing was stripped!  No big deal, I thought, I would just call the company.  They are not willing to replace the prodect unless I pay for shipping.  They recomeded that I take it to a local store to replace knowing that it was purchased over 1000 miles away and not at a chain store!  Passing the buck.  I then asked to speak to a super visor and she repeated the same mantra, "sorry company policey."  I never go to the lengths that I am now, but I am tired of companies not performing the basic duties of customer satisfaction.  They want me to go to the post office and mail it to them at which time they will determine whose fault it is and then mail me a new one.  When I asked if there was any way around said policy the manager told me I could write a letter.  So here it is 
 This is billed as a thriller but there are hardly any thrills.  It would have benefitted from some judicious cutting to make it a little leaner.  The shaky camera work detracts from some decent scenery.  The politics of the film contain no subtlety or shades of gray; I can almost see a couple of college sophomores hitting the bong and sitting down to hash out the script:  Bong-hitting liberal student who has no clue about the real world #1:  ...and then she discovers the evil corporation has been testing... BHLSWHNCATRW #2: (Interrupts)  "Evil Corporation"?  Why are you being redundant?  The only plus for my wife and I was the acting, which was great.  Fiennes was especially good, underplaying his character in the early parts of the film, resulting in a character with depth and nuance.  I only wish the rest of the film was worthy of the performances contained within it 
 The authors use of words make the British Redcoat seem foolish and weak. If this book is meant to be about the battles of the revolution then why are all the American victories listed and yet not all of the British ones? Makes no sense to me seeing as the British won most of the battles.   If you want to read a 'false feel good propoganda' type of book then feel free to go for this one BUT take everything you read with  a massive pinch of salt. It's these type of books that have completely churned factual history into a euphoria of false patriotic rhetoric.  Rebels and Redcoats will provide you with a far more comprehensive and factual base from which to look at the war from.   
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 what appeared to be a good read from the description, in all reality, proved to be a bunch of poorly connected ideas that all in all did nothing to enhance my understanding of the functioning of the human mind.   
 We all like hearing scary stories about monsters.  This book provides a few of them.  Because of its pulp horror novel quality it has some redeaming value.  The negatives make it not only a bad read, but make me wish that I had not read it. 1) The author spends a lot of time tooting his own horn. This is fine, but you grow weary of it after a few chapters.  It wouldn't be so annoying but because of the way he writes comes off as if he is trying too hard to make it sound like NOT bragging.  Because of this I grew very aware of it, like when your tounge won't stop worrying at a new tooth-filling. 2) It grows very predictable.  We get it!  Serial killers are psychos who fit into patterns and act out fantasies. It isn't a surprise anymore once we learned this early in the book. 3) Ressler brags about his profile helping to send 4-5 Chicago teenagers to prison for a a grusome murder/rape.  A decade after this book went to press DNA evidence and discovery of the real killers proved that these kids had been railroaded--unequivocally innocent.  Ooops!  This incredibly gross injustice wouldn't seem so terrible if Ressler didn't come off as such a judgemental, I-told-you-so-ing, J. Edgar Hoover loving cop's cop 
 After first buying WR's "Heavy Weather" I'd have to say that this album really disappointed me. Now it does have it's moments(nubian sundance), but all in all, I'm just not feeling this one.I didn't like the sound quality...but it wasnt all about that though. As opposed to "Heavy Weather" Songs like "Cucumber slumber" sound dated...Kinda puts me in the mind of a bad 70's blaxploitation movie, while other songs just plain put me to sleep. Basically it just doesn't have that funky/rock/jazzy sound that Jaco Pastorius brought to the mix. 
 The first Butterfly Effect is one of my all-time favorite movies. With that in mind, I eagerly started watching BE2. Within the first 5 minutes it became clear that I was going to have to stretch the truth in order to claim this was a good movie. But after finishing it, it was clear that I would have to flat-out lie to do that.  There is one and only one redeeming factor in this movie: Erica Durance naked. But it's too softcore, short, and pointless to really be worth anything.  The writing is terrible. The story is lifted directly from the original, only without any semblance of personal feeling or emotion. It manages to be both predictable and borderline nonsensical, a feat unparelleled in modern film. The protagonist comes off as an idiotic, self-concerned, petty jerk that even jerks would have a hard time identifying with. The acting is...barely passable, for the most part, but the story's protagonist is just plain bad at expressing all the things this character needs to express.  The first one was great because you never knew exactly what to expect - how long would he be able to keep doing this? Would this one be the last? In the sequel, this is gone, but without any extra twists or added value to keep it interesting.  If you have any fond memories of the first one, avoid this turd 
 Quite amateur, really.  The author should have also focused on women who form cliques in environments such at work etc, but sadly, this was omitted from the book.  Cliques are found within adult environments too!  Therefore, the book is not really aimed for adults, and yet, adults would be the main purchasers.  In addition, the author did not attempt to explain why girls behave in this fashion, and could have used psychological and sociological perspectives to aid her.  Instead, personal experiences were told by girls which did not really explain any real type of behaviour.  Furthermore, the proof-reader did not do a very good job in finding errors, hence the poor quality of the text.  I would not recommend this book, I am confident a buyer can find better elsewhere 
 Not much in the way of humor on this one ("Easter Eggs" and "Orange Drink"-which was stolen from Bobcat Goldthwait, of all people-being the lone exceptions).  If you like George Carlin's "angry" period, where he rails against everything without being funny, you'll like this.  If you're looking for laughs, spend your money elsewhere 
 This book is unfortunately incomplete, although its intentions are good.  Most people are combination types--kapha-pitta, vata-pitta, etc. but the book ignores this necessary fact in its presentation, and acts as though every person is a pure type.  After a long, difficult search, I found this subject addressed AFTER the main body of the material--and not in any convenient or helpful manner.  Both authors totally ignored my phone calls and emails asking for help on this issue, which doesn't do anything to inspire confidence or a positive attitude toward the book.  Frawley is a prolific author and should do more than just present an overview, which would require a live teacher to make sense of the material.  
 The first problem to surmount, opening Sin Killer, is to reconcile yourself to the fact that this farce is written by the man who brought us Lonesome Dove.  If you can do that, then it's time to judge the book on a level playing field.  And the worst part is, this isn't a good book by any standards.  McMurtry has often said, during interviews, that he wrote Lonesome Dove while trying to write an 'anti-western'.  Obviously, he failed miserably, reviving a worn out genre and winning a Pulitzer Prize.  Here, he succeeds, filling the pages with preposterous farce in a western setting and populating his book with outrageous characters.  Unfortunately, it's played for comedy and the long and the short is that the book has few laughs in it.  Because the characters are caricatures, frequently disposed of by axe, arrow, hatchet and gun, we're not supposed to care about them.  And surprise, surprise, we don't.  The truth is that the whole concept behind the Berrybender Narratives fails miserably, neither amusing or educating.  Perhaps it would have been better off as a graphic novel, or a cartoon.  For those tricked into thinking they're entering Lonesome Dove territory by the similarity of the book covers, beware.  McMurtry may have written the book to amuse himself rather than the reader, but the marketers are simply out to fool you.  
 Okay? What was the point of this book? Because after I got through reading it, I failed to see the "big picture" that Sharon Short was trying to convey.  I'm an avid book reader. If a book reaches out and immeditely grabs my attention, I usually can finish it within 2 days.  I had to force myself to simply pick up, "Death In The Cards."  Sharon Short, doesn't write a story that flows...instead she writes a book that gives a lot of explanations. For example, in one chapter she explains that there's only two jail cells in the building. Who cares?   A writer should have a "method to their madness." This book consists of rambling and things that merely do not make sense.  There were entirely too many characters, and they also lacked diversity.  I almost forgot that I was reading a mystery/suspense thriller.  But, on a positive note, I'm glad that Sharon Short got published 
 .... and a little mouse is born. A flaccid bladder of utter banality inflated by the hot air of middle-brow legalism and obscurantist prose. No exploration of any depth or detail is carried out of the disruption wrought by a market-dependent way of life on the ecological, anthropological, cultural, social, political and psychological fibres that hold together the world's various societies, or on the fragility and volatility of the global market itself, which, of course, is portrayed as a fait accompli. Thus there is simply no contextual platform for the author's analysis, and, despite the standard air of portent, no clear picture of what law and militarism can or might actually do in the near future, and we are left non the wiser about what the course of history might actually BE. This work is fairly indicative of the mainstream American understanding of history; my advice is that they take a break from making it, or we are all in big trouble 
 Desdemona is an odd ball in her family.  She comes from a family of theater people, but she doesn't have any of the family talent for acting.  Instead, she runs a catering company that helps keep the rest of the family financial stable.  Stark runs a computer security company and first meets Desdemona when he is jilted and Desdemona is trying to collect on her catering bill for a wedding that never happened.  The characters in the book seem flat and with about 100 pages left I found myself skimming because I didn't really care what happened.  Sometimes the characters just acted completely irrationally.  For example, they didn't call the police when major evidence was found in a murder case.  I just couldn't get into it when the characters seemed so ridiculously unreal 
 This tuner does not function properly.  It jumps all over the board from A to F to G and the dots in the middle in one pluck of the strings.  I have just spent an hour of my time trying to tune the guitar to no evail, and let me tell you I have tuned cellos, violins, violas, and have had vast experince in tuning instruments.  This was absolutly the worst tuner I have ever used 
 Do you love ripoff artists such as Lenny Kravitz and Norah Jones? Does true originality disturb you and drive you to seek cover in the soft womb of corporate created fluff marketed as the real deal?  Then you're in for a treat with this album! Not even Rich Little could do Billie better.  Texture of voice AND delivery expertly stolen without a qualm, but without any of the icky sincerity and authentic pain of the original. Enjoy 
 I took a chance (it's pricey) and purchased this item.  "What the heck," I thought.  I used it (a single 'squirt') once a day in the morning.  This was instead of the recommendation of twice a day.  I like the stuff.  My skin felt lubricated and smooth without feeling greasy.  In fact, I'd give it five stars except that now it's three weeks since I purchased this product and 'poof!' it's gone!  I figure that it comes to about 30 cents a squirt.  In my mind the 'goodness' of this product isn't worth the exorbitant price.  Hence, two stars 
 The truth is that a newly-sober alcoholic named William Griffith Wilson -- a down-on-his-luck former Wall Street hustler who put on airs of having once been a prosperous stock broker -- just sat down, in December of 1938, and wrote up twelve commandments for the new religious group that he and fellow alcoholic Doctor Robert Smith had started. Those commandments were simply a repackaged version of the practices of a cult religion that was popular at that time, something called "The Oxford Group", or "The Oxford Group Movement", and later, "Moral Re-Armament" -- a religious cult that was created by a deceitful fascist renegade Lutheran minister named Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman -- a nut-case who actually praised Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler.   Bill Wilson described the writing of the Twelve Steps this way:   Well, we finally got to the point where we really had to say what this book was all about and how this deal works. As I told you this had been a six-step program then.   The idea came to me, well, we need a definite statement of concrete principles that these drunks can't wiggle out of. There can't be any wiggling out of this deal at all and this six-step program had two big gaps which people wiggled out of.   Notice how Bill Wilson considered his fellow alcoholics to be a bunch of cheaters who will "wiggle out of this deal" if they can get away with it -- which Bill won't allow.   And note how Bill Wilson made himself the leader who was entitled to dictate the concrete terms of other people's recovery programs.  Also notice how Bill Wilson considered 'spiritual development' to be a business deal, with a contract that you can't wiggle out of, something like selling your soul in trade for sobriety.   Nowhere in the Twelve Steps does it say that you should quit drinking, or help anyone else to quit drinking, either. Nowhere do the words "sobriety", "recovery", "abstinence", "health", "happiness", "joy", "love", or "love", appear in the Twelve Steps. The word "alcohol" was only mentioned once, where it was patched into the first step as a substitute for the word "sin" -- Bill Wilson wrote,  "we are powerless over alcohol and our lives have become unmanageable",  instead of the Oxford Group slogan,  "we are powerless over sin and have been defeated by it".  And then the phrase "especially alcoholics" was patched into the 12th step as a suggested target for further recruiting efforts:  "...we tried to carry this message to others, especially alcoholics"...  (But regular non-alcoholic people were still fair game for recruiting into Bill's "spiritual fellowship"...)   The Twelve Steps are not a formula for curing or treating alcoholism, and they never were.  The Twelve Steps are not "spiritual principles" and they never were.  The Twelve Steps are cult practices that work to convert people into confirmed true believers in a proselytizing cult religion, just like Frank Buchman's so-called "spiritual principles" did.   1. The Twelve Steps do not work as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems.  The A.A. failure rate ranges from 95% to 100%. Sometimes, the A.A. success rate is actually less than zero, which means that A.A. indoctrination is positively harmful to people, and prevents recovery. Some tests have shown that even receiving no treatment at all for alcoholism is much better than receiving A.A. treatment:  One of the most enthusiastic boosters of Alcoholics Anonymous, Professor George Vaillant of Harvard University, who is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), showed by his own 8 years of testing of A.A. that A.A. was worse than useless -- that it didn't help the alcoholics any more than no treatment at all, and it had the highest death rate of any treatment program tested -- a death rate that Professor Vaillant himself described as "appalling". While trying to prove that A.A. treatment works, Professor Vaillant actually proved that A.A. kills. After 8 years of A.A. treatment, the score with Dr. Vaillant's first 100 alcoholic patients was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.  (Nevertheless, Vaillant is still a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, and he still wants to send all alcoholics to A.A. anyway, to "get an attitude change by confessing their sins to a high-status healer." That is cult religion, not a treatment program for alcoholism.)  The A.A. dropout rate is terrible. Most people who come to A.A. looking for help in quitting drinking are appalled by the narrow-minded atmosphere of fundamentalist religion and faith-healing. The A.A. meeting room has a revolving door. The therapists, judges, and parole officers (many of whom are themselves hidden members of A.A. or N.A.) continually send new people to A.A., but those newcomers vote with their feet once they see what A.A. really is. Even A.A.'s own triennial surveys, conducted by the A.A. headquarters (the GSO), say that:  81% of the newcomers are gone within 30 days,  90% are gone in 3 months, and  95% are gone at the end of a year.  That automatically gives A.A. a failure rate of at least 95%. But the GSO does not count all of those people who only attend a few meetings before quitting -- they don't qualify as "members". (That amounts to "cherry-picking".) If we included them, then the numbers would be much worse.   First there is the propaganda technique of "everybody's doing it": "AA or a similar Twelve-Step program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries".  That is a complete falsehood. The vast majority of the successful people recover without A.A. or any "support group". It's what "everybody" is doing.  Then they use the propaganda techniques of use of the passive voice and vague suggestions: "It is widely believed that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can put a recovering addict on the road to relapse."  It is widely believed by whom? And what do those unnamed people know? What are their qualifications? Are they doctors? Medical school professors? Or salesmen for a 12-Step treatment center? Why should we care what some unnamed invisible fools allegedly believe, anyway?  The authors also use the propaganda technique of fear-mongering: you will be "on the road to relapse" -- you will probably die -- unless you practice Bill Wilson's Twelve Step cult religion.  And then the fluff-headed Pollyanna attitude is outrageous: Just going to the wonderful A.A. meetings is supposedly all that is needed to fix some alcoholics.  But since A.A. has a zero-percent success rate above and beyond the normal rate of spontaneous remission, that cannot possibly be tru 
 Whether you're planning to read through Crowley's Book of Thoth for the first time, or if you think you know every little thing Crowley was getting at with it, this book is going to be equally useless to you. Several of Crowley's diagrams from the Book of Thoth are reprinted in this book much more clearly, but sadly that's the only good thing about this book.   The book is filled with a lot of fluff. Duquette tells many useless anecdotes of Crowley's and Harris' lives, and constantly excuses and defends Crowley's character against those who would consider him a devil worshiper. Duquette explains in the book that he initially thought that when he first found Crowley's works, so perhaps its some sort of atonement. But the argument really has no place in a book like this where the reader has already come to terms with Crowley's character.  Through out the Book of Thoth Crowley constantly alludes to and makes references to other works and various myths and systems. Having a reference book that explained all of these things would be an invaluable aid. Unfortunately Duquette doesn't do this. His background information is base and scarce. He does spend some time explaining about Thelema and Kabbalah, but as one would expect from a chapter long explanation of subjects like this, Duquette doesn't give nearly enough information to understand Crowley's works, and what he does give is easy enough to find elsewhere.  As for offering anything knew or shedding some understanding on Crowley's work, Duquette outright fails. At times it seems as if Duquette doesn't even understand Crowley or the Book of Thoth and the associated tarot deck. I don't think the man even understands tarot in general (and Duquette's own tarot deck is evidence of this too). At his best, Duquette only manages to rephrase what Crowley had to say in the book of Thoth. Typically though a lot of what Crowley was getting at is complete lost in Duquette's work, a lot of it no doubt because Duquette never really understood Crowley at anything but a very base level.  Reading through the Book of Thoth, there are a few ways in which Duquette could have made his book better. Crowley's phonetic translation of the I Ching doesn't follow the current standard, and sometimes the differences are confusing, especially if the reader is not already familiar with the I Ching. A key showing Crowley's translation and the standard translation would've been helpful. Likewise Crowley rarely wrote on astrology, despite astrology being alluded to many times through the Book of Thoth, and what he did write is hard to find. A chapter explaining Crowley's views on astrology would've been great. If that wasn't possible, then a list of books on astrology that were similar to what Crowley was working with would have been helpful. However Duquette's solution is to just tell the reader to go find some books on astrology to read.  Duquette's book isn't useful as a reference to Crowley's work. Duquette doesn't seem to understand Crowley most of the time, and fails to adequatley explain Crowley's ideas. Besides some new-agey nonsense, like assigning celebrities to the court cards based on their birthdays, Duquette doesn't offer any new ideas or insights into Crowley's work. Except for a few nice diagrams (which are common enough and easy to find), there isn't anything worthwhile contained in this book. At least not anything you won't get out of reading Crowley's Book of Thoth 
 Anybody with a cheap pair of cutting pliers will be able to cut through the cable in seconds. I know because I just did it. The cable is very thin and is made of pliable steel wire. You could even use household scissors to gnaw through.  Having this lock on is better than nothing because the thief needs to have some cutting tool and then has to deal with the remaining lock that is attached to your computer. However, if you are going to go through the trouble of locking up your computer, you might as well get something with a stronger cable 
 My complaints about this stand: 1. By far the worst thing about this stand is it leans too far forward.  There's not enough counter-weight so a slight pull on the bike will cause the thing to tip.  If it wasn't for this, I might say, "well I guess it's alright for 79 dollars." 2. The clamp isn't strong enough to hold the bike securely.  If you clamp to seat-post for example it will rotate on the seat-post. 3. The thing that tightens the clamp is made of plastic.  I'm assuming it will break fairly quickly. 4. The rotator is made of plastic - I haven't tried rotating on the seat post where it would put any weight on the rotator, but I doubt it will hold it. In my opinion this product should not be sold.  If you just want to clean your bike on a stand, it's fine, but for anything that requires any force like taking the pedals or crank arms off, forget-about-it 
 I found this timetable difficult to use.  When the description called it encyclopedic they must have been talking about its size and weight. One might find it informative to just thumb thru and see what was happening in different areas of the world at different time.  But to use the book to trace a particular development (like "movable type," or "domesticated dairy animals,") or to compare progressive periods of history between civilizations (like Central and South America, China, or Egypt) is awkward with lots of bookmarks and notes.  
 The Playstation controller is nice. However the Nintendo 64 user would remember that the N64 controller was just a snazzy, maybe even more so. The XBOX controller is like a brick when compared to both. The PS2 delivered on a vibrating Dual Shock controller as standard with the unit. This controller feels great with the thumb pads / thumb sticks allowing for all sorts of movement. Suddenly in 2005, four years after the PS2 was released, games like Metal Gear Solid III: Snake Eater and God of War improve on this thumb pad function with the new mini-games feature. The controller has been given new life because of this.  The big negative is the problem that Sony PS2 controllers are extremely poor quality. This controller, for all its design, will give you a dual shock. First of all you will be shocked at how suddenly they break. Drop it on the floor and you will easily damage the L1, L2 or R1, R2 wing buttons. Even if you don't drop it the wing buttons will usually break in less than a year if you enjoy gaming. The next shock is going through so many of these controllers because of this design flaw. Adding up the cost of each controller I could easily have bought myself another PS2 and then some more. The cord also has an uncanny ability to just wrap around itself and kink. I have never seen one that managed to remain straight. Also when a button breaks it tends to release little pieces into the controller so even if you don't need that button for the game the controller feels like it has sand rolling around inside of it.  For all its handheld conditioning the controller is far from robust. I have used a very similar Logitech Cordless Rumblepad 2 for the PC that is the same design as the PS2 controller and that is a proper robust model. Just comparing the two side by side makes the PS2 controller look like it was developed in the USSR in the early 80s or something. The fact that Sony have done absolutely nothing to improve on the quality of their own generic PS2 controller is probably the reason why they have made so much money out of the PS2 unit. It is a way too expensive even if the controller was more robust. I hope Sony get it right with the PS3 next time. Make these controllers more robust please. The PS2 controller was always far from a quality device since its inception and is the only item that let the PS2 down badly 
 First of all, I live in Kansas where this all actually happened. I wasn't even born when the BTK killer was on his spree. Infact, I didn't know anything about him until he resurfaced in 2005 and was all over the news. My whole problem with this movie (besides it sucking), is that it wasn't factual. They didn't have time and dates right or even how many people he had killed. He started killing in 74' and his last was in 77' or 78' and he killed 2 men and 8 women. It was just lame overall and not accurate. I would give no stars but you can't do that so I gave it one 
 I am not a great fan of this novel. For me, this is Chatwin at his most show offy. This book followed hot on the heels of his thumpingly successful debut 'In Patagonia' and Chatwin was clearly garnering a reputation for describing far flung places in an original and inventive way. This he does in the Viceroy of Ouidah, a short biographical novel about the Brazillian Manoel de Silva who rose from poverty and obscurity to become the head of slave trading in Dahomey, now Benin in West Africa. A potentially brilliant framework for Chatwin's prose style to let rip you might think, but I think he goes overboard on the lush descriptions of the geography, climate and people of the regions he illuminates and loses sight of how to really engage the reader in the novel.   This novel was not all that well received when it first came out. His next work 'On the Black Hill' reveived the 1982 Whitbread Literary Award for Best First Novel, overlooking the fact that Chatwin had alreay published Viceroy previously and I think this is telling. I found the novel lacking in the gripping substance, intangible though that may be that really makes a great novel. Like one of the many works of art Chatwin catalogued when he was working at Sotheby's, it is a glistening gem, but beneath the surface, there is little that stirs the soul and lodges in the memory as passages of great fiction do.   Still worth reading though, as Chatwin at his worst is better than many writers at their best. 
 Britain, circa 1997.  Tony Blair is elected P.M.  Princess Di perishes.  And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public.  This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing.  To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is.  Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor.  The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what "A Hard Days' Night" did for the Beatles.  Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze.  I was reminded more of the Monkees' "Head" than I was of "A Hard Days' Night".  Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught.  Oh, well.  On to "From Justin to Kelly" 
 I watched this movie on BRAVO one time, and they were plugging it as a comedy. Unless you have a screwed up sense of humor, this moive is far from that. It's very tragic, but then again, perhaps I'm just over-sensitive and gullable. I feel that I was mislead and I hate this film and will never watch it again. 
 I listened to this album again recently after purchasing when it came out. Even for this type of music it came across as way to cliched for the time and still sounds overtly juvenile. This was the final straw for a mate of mine who went from glam to death as a result. Still, they sound good and with a slightly different lyrical approach may have been bigger. A parody of the genre but no one told them 
 Are we all mad???? No really?   This is a nice book.   Well presented and well-made but it is blank book and how much does it cost?   The Book of Shadows is a sacred book of spells, recipes and feelings.   It does not have to be leather(look)-bound and cost a fortune.   It is the content which is valuable not the coverings.  Sorry to be so negative.   Blessed be 
 The first 5 minutes was OK. After that, this TV-movie started using all the cliches of...a TV-movie. A bad one.  These cliches include: 1. Many references to babies both on and off the plane. 2. Young love as apparently-orphaned young adults ponder their future together. 3. A supposedly very drunk man becoming rowdy and argumentative, yet showing no real signs of being drunk though much was said about the volume of his drinking. 4. An unhappy man dictating some thoughts - then eventually joyfully reconsidering his comments and throwing the tape recorder away. 5. The expanded time frame, where events that would normally take perhaps a couple minutes dragged out for 1/2 hour - in this case the final descent of the plane. 6. Simplistic explanations of some "technical jargon" for the benefit of only the audience. 7. Voice-overs of the thoughts of some of the characters as they are about to land.  There were also some bad lapses of reality. These include: 1. The claim that the airplane had never been test-flown or simulated when out of gas. 2. Having some sports cars whiz by only feet away - on a wet surface no less - from recreational hot-rodders parked on the abandoned runway who are working on cars and milling about.  3. The apparently stupid teen who can't hear his father yelling and waving at him from 30 feet away to get the hell off the runway as the plane is about to land on him. The worst for last...    4. No one even attempts any crash position during the landing. 5. After landing, the pilot and co-pilot sit there for 10 seconds and contemplate the minor amount of smoke coming up through the console. Note there is no actual fire whatsoever... 6. After all the passengers slide down the rear slide, the co-pilot and other crew slide down, and gather right at the bottom of the slide rather than, say, getting off the runway away from the plane. Only the pilot remains on board. He lingers in the doorway, then decides to go back into the nose again. Why? To fight the nonexistent fire. Egads! He is now overcome by smoke. We wait and wait for him to reappear, but gosh, he doesn't. So the crew must climb back up the ladder to rescue him. Finally everyone gets off the plane. Everyone cheers and congratulates the foolhardy pilot.  The End. Except it's not. There is a freeze-frame on each of the characters with a caption telling what happens to them in the future.  I wanted to give it at least 2 stars but in all honesty I can't.     
 Although all the other reviews simply rave about this 2 CD set, and "This CD set was awarded a rosette by the Penguin Guide to Compact Discs", I just listened to both CDS.  Very very disappointed.  The music is very bland, no passion, very passive. I could not believe what I was hearing.  Anytime I see ASMITF as the orchestra playing Mozart, I usually am pleased..but this time I was not.  I am sticking with Mitsuko Uchida (pianist) and Mr. Tate (conductor)...for her playing of the Mozart concertos.. 
 If you have had the opportunity to see the (out-of-print) show catalogue (Giorgio Morandi: [catalogue of] an exhibition of paintings, water-colours, drawings and etchings) this skimpy overview will not only disappoint, it also will not whet your appetite for more of this insightful artist's  oeuvre 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 Positioning makes a few basic points that are helpful for someone who is not familiar with marketing basics.  However, the examples are so outdated that some now disprove the authors' arguments.  The more detailed chapters make less sense in an electronic culture.  This book is really only useful now for those broad, basic ideas in the first chapters 
 Beware of  assuming that  the UV filter recommended by Amazon for a particular camera with a fixed lense size that I purchased is the correct  size.  It wasn't even close.  No size was given for the lense diameter. I returned the filter for a full refund minus my shipping & all the hassel of  packaging it 
 Swartzwelder is the best writer on the Simpsons staff, bar none. But his prose style leaves so much to be desired. What works within the context of a voiced animated show falls flat on its face in print.  Swartzwelder revisits the character of Frank Burly, P.I., last seen in "The Time Machine Did It". That earlier novel worked, even though the joke got a litle long-in-the-tooth at the end. Here, the attempt to once again meld film-noirish black-and-white movie cliches with 50s-ish science fiction, this time an alien invasion that only Burly is too stupid to realize is happening, cannot even elicit a guffaw.  Some may feel Burly is simply Homer recast as Phillip Marlowe. But even Homer would remember to be, you know...funny. In this case, the formula very quickly becomes. Burly almost discovers invasion, incident causes Burly great pain, Burly forgets there is an invasion. It just does not hold up.  Maybe those who read this book without reading its predeccesor will enjoy it more as they will be unfamiliar with the formula. For those who are attracted purely by the "writer of the Simpsons" blurb, you're better off buying any of the DVDs and passing on this.  
 If you take the time to write a biography of a person, isn't it part of one's research to interview their wife? Donya Fiorentino was married to or lived with David Fincher for 5 years and gave him a daughter. When they met, he was directing Pepsi commercials, and when they split up, he was an auteur. For some reason, Sharon Waxman made no effort to interview or contact Donya, and dismisses her in two sentences as an alcoholic and drug addict. In fact, Donya has been sober for 6 years, is a brilliant and creative photographer who has an edgy side to the Fincher story that has never been told. I know the truth; as Donya's physician I have heard her compelling story. Waxman also does not mention that after their divorce, she married Gary Oldman. This was written with my patient's permission, who was very hurt by this book's publication 
 The picture does not match what I received. The picture shows a virtual wall for the new Roomba models. Instead, I received a wall for the original Roomba model 
 This is a book for a web course I took this term. The book has an interesting set up; half of the chapter is a textbook type chapter, with background and information, the other half is a reader with selections from modern feminists. The first half was nicely done. There was the main part of the text, with boxes that featured activities and polls and profiles. The second half is what pissed me off. Now no offense to any pacific islander lesbians or hispanic transgendered people, I have no problem or complaints with you. The book however, got so caught up with issues that effected a small microcosm of society, that it failed to connect with me. You know a white woman college student. In many cases it insulted me, one essay refered to women in the academic world as 'white women helpers' of the 'male heirarchy.' Excuse me as I get my flying monkeys. It  made the classic mistake of open-mindedness; it closed its mind to everything but what its being open-minded about.   I have a friend in college whose goal is to get married and have kids. She is majoring in physical therapy and plans to work in the school system so her schedual will work with the kids scheduals. Great goals, she knows more about where she is going than I am. The people portrayed in this book (and many in the course) would consider her a sell out. Would respect her more if she was living in the back of a Westfalia van writing a zine or lesbian p0rn or something. And I just can't stand that. While a man and some ankle-biters might not be in my future any time soon, I respect that that is what she wants in life. Whats the meaning of a 'woman's movement' if they don't respect women 
 Reading previously written reviews, I was expecting this to be a well recorded, meditative recitation of the Holy Rosay with gentle background music.  What is actually provided is a CD that sounds as if it was recorded on pre world war II equipment, with the "group responses" sounding rushed.  Nowhere is music to be found on the recordings of the Traditional Mysteries.    You'd be much better off watching Mother Angelica's daily Rosay on EWTN than spending hard earned money on this rather rushed and ameturish sounding recording.  
 I've enjoyed Johansen's books for years, but this one was awful...I'm beginning to wonder if she's using a ghost writer.  Totally ridiculous plot, trite dialogue...I lost count of the times she used the phrase "Sophie said through her teeth..."  I was beginning to wish someone was PULLING my teeth rather than having to read this book.  Johansen is capable of SO MUCH BETTER than this!  I'm praying she isn't falling into the Nora Roberts/Danielle Steel/James Patterson habit of churning out the same old tired fodder just to meet a publisher's deadline 
 I agree with all the other one star reviews (would give it zero if I could).  The author is a snob who  doesn't see the people whose lives she is supposedly reporting on as human beings in any way equal to herself.  If they take their "menial" jobs seriously she looks down on them.  She demeans hard work and celebrates entitlement.  For another view of the poor with some conception of how people's behavior shapes their lives, read LIFE AT THE BOTTOM. 
 I'm going to weigh in on these dreadfully unfunny films.  These films are both stupid and terribly dated.  I can't understand how even a contemporary audience, back in the 1920s, could enjoy this unfunny nonsense.  I wanted to stay til the end, but I found myself fast forwarding because I just couldn't take it.  There is absolutely nothing funny about Buster Keaton or either of these terrible waste of time flicks 
 Because of tummy troubles, my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet.  Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered, as it is almost completely tasteless.  I can't give it a one star which qualifies as  hating it, as I can't hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients, but it is not good.  It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting!  I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annie's.  This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it 
 I just watched yet another Martin Yan show on TV.  Being a Chinese who has lived in the U.S. for 10 years, I am ever so saddened by the fact that people really think this guy is cooking the "real" stuff.  My friends and I just think that he puts on a good show.  If you enjoy his food, please do not get the wrong impression that it is Chinese.  He has substantially modified many of the dishes to fit American taste, just as many western restaurants in the Orient would make western food which have been changed to fit the Asian taste buds.  I have seen westerners making faces in western restaurants in the Orient exclaiming, is this what you called a hamburger?  (you can substitute "hamburger with the name of any other dishes)  The reaction of Chinese towards Yan's cooking is the same 
 While this book contains a ton of data, don't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade.  If you look up french toast, for example, it only gives information on name brand items.  Much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products.  I suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping, or use it before eating out, it would be helpful.  But if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items, you are out of luck with this book 
 Having first seen the movie, I was prepared that this was not a starry-eyed wholesale endorsement of high school football, but I was still thrilled when my wife surprised me with a copy to read.  I have never been so dissapointed with a book on football, or all of sports for that matter. I enjoyed Next Man Up and A Civil War, due to Feinstein's balance between negative and positive lights on the game. Bissinger, in Friday Night Lights, shows no such balance. He does not "follow the season" in any logical fashion, sometimes skipping entire games, and spends a chapter instead focusing on national politics. Honestly, you'll see the name of Michael Dukakis more than you will the name of Permian's starting quarterback.  I love football, I love high school athletics, and found this book to be very annoying. Check it out in a library before you spend your dollars on it 
 Bought this for my son.  He loved it and played with it a lot for about a week.  Then the wheels broke.  He wasn't doing anything unusual with the board just riding it back and forth on the driveway.  The wheels seemed to warp and twist making them unstable 
 This I by far the worst Scarpetta book in the series. What a shame that Cornwell let this amazing series of books get away from her. First of all, this book does redeem that terrible ending to the preceding work, `Black Notice' in which for the umpteenth time Scarpetta foolishly allows a serial killer into her home for an inevitable dull climax. And this book does have a very engaging premise in which Scarpetta is the victim here on trial, and her name is being sullied. But aside from that, this book is a disaster.   I hated the ending of Black Notice and was furious with Cornwell that she devastated a remarkably taught book with it. Other than that, I thought that the writing was the best she had done and was looking forwards to this new one because it seemed that Cornwell grew as an author from one book to the next. Also I felt that it was well past time that she tried to get away from the very predictable plot line that she has used in every single Scarpetta book up to this point. But for some reason, Cornwell's prose just falls apart here; it is dull and lengthy, without a shred of the suspense that I have grown to expect from this fine author. And the promising plot just collapses as she tries with all of her might to force it into the conformity and safe harbors of her past novels.   Some of what I hated most about this book are that there is no detecting here, Scarpetta just happenstances upon the end solution, its as if Cornwell became tired of writing and just hurried through the last couple of chapters to bring this book to an end. Secondly, Some of what could have made this book interesting, such as Scarpetta's supposed guilt over a murder from `Black Notice' never becomes a full-fledged possibility. Instead Cornwell skates around this alluring plot, spending half of the book building it up, but never pushing it over the edge. Thirdly, what's the point of having any extra characters such as Lucy or Marino? Marino never seems to add anything but bluster, why does Scarpetta always say he is the greatest homicide cop ever? All Marino ever does is leap to the wrong conclusions. Secondly, Lucy and her Last Precinct firm never get off the ground. Why was the Last Precinct firm even in the book? What did Lucy do to help her aunt?  The only interesting thing this book offered was two interactions. One was with the psychiatrist Anna and the other was with the ADA Berger. Both of these scenes either reminiscing over WWII or walking through some evidence were well done.   Cornwell, if you read these, break the mold. Do you have to have serial killers in every novel? Do you have to follow the same plot line?  
 The faith of George Bush is in what? Money? Oil? His dad?  My Lord said Love thy enemy and do good to those who harm you Not kill a million iraqis for oil fields  My Lord said it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven  Not give all our national treasury and indebtedness to the wealthiest corporations while impoverishing our people and leaving our elderly and infirm to drown in a rainstorm  My Lord said Blessed are the peacemakers not those who keep changing their lies about going to war.  What is his faith again? My Lord said: Not all those who cry Lord, Lor shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven.  My Lord said it. I believe it. Case closed.  What his faith all about? Material possession does not prove election anymore than faked vote counts   SEll all that you have and give the money to the poor and then come follow me, said the Lord, and you will have riches in heaven.  Blessed are the POOR reads his Sermon on the MOunt in Saint Luke  Anyway what's that cover photo supposed to be? Mr. Jim Beam make him nauseous again? Or does he hang his head in shame for the one million dead for their oil fileds in Iraq? FOr our stolen elections? For the dead of KAtrina? For murdering our US Consitution and Bill of Rights? No, it's gas. Hoping no one notices he cut it. No, looks like he's controlling a leak into his Depends.  
 This toy was so frustrating, the pieces wouldn't snap together properly and it was messy and my son ended up walking away from it he was so fed up.   This was after a half an hour of me attempting to make the pieces fit together properly.  In the end, it looked like a pile of cloudy lime Jello with plastic bones sticking out of it.  I would not reccomend this toy 
 I can't, for the life of me, figure out why this book is getting such rave reviews. I found it to be a major disappointment, mostly because the reviews led me to expect much more. This book is for the TOTALLY clueless, ie., those who don't know that rosemary goes with lamb and chicken, apples with pork, beans with bacon, etc. I can see how it could help jumpstart a kitchen novice, but if a professional chef needs this book he/she is in the wrong profession. There's absolutely nothing new here. To make matters worse, it's in boring black and white with not one image (color or otherwise) to inspire or break the monotony. I've tried again and again to find a reason to keep this book but can't come up with one. It's up for sale. Sorry folks, I just can't agree on this one. 
 this book is held in high honors by historians, but in contempt by archaeologists - and for good reason. if you want to understand a period of human history from which the literary evidence is virtually non-existent, you must incorporate other sources of evidence in your treaty. murray does not, and his vision of archaic greece is thus vastly different to the view of robin osbourne, whose "greece in the making" is a much better treatment of the archaic period than this. oswyn murray, although a vastly skilled historian and a wonderful scholar, just does not get it right.  if you have no idea of what is going on during the 7th and 6th centuries BC and have this book at hand, by all means read it - but please keep in mind that there are much better treatments of the period available 
 Just finished reading this 451 pages book.   I think that the main character Vincent is pretty disgusting. He's weak, humble and miserable. When I was reading around page 400 I was tempted to close the book and return it, only the desire to find out how it all ended kept me from doing that.  Vincent is the bold example of a man who is not in charge of his destiny, he is not even in charge of his house and his time. His coworker bullied him into going from house to house to advertise Bible study classes, she painted the walls of his house with her positive thinking quotes.   So the verdict - unless you are really bored or interested in Chinese way of living - don't read it 
 What a disappointment.  The spinner just can't gain enough speed to do anything lilke what it is supposed to do.  Overall, it's  a cheap item with limited supplies for the $ 
 'The Hellenistic Philosophers, Volume 2: Greek and Latin Texts with Notes and Bibliography' by A. A. Long (ISBN-10: 0521275571} was first published by Cambridge University Press in 1987.  Presumably at that time it was a real book.  In other words, in keeping with the scholarly nature of its contents, it was well-printed on quality paper, had a durable cover, and was stitched so that it would open flat for ease of reference.    Sadly, the present object (which we are informed was "Transferred to digital printing in 2003" and no doubt became much cheaper to manufacture) is none of these things.  The print is blurred, the paper is at best of middling quality, the paper covers are flimsy, and since it comes with a disgusting glued back it cannot be opened flat without cracking the spine.  One wonders what has happened to the sense of honor, to pride in producing a well-made object, and to the desire to give the customer a handsome book at a reasonable price that would last and not disintegrate within a few years?   Although no specialist in Hellenistic philosophy, and therefore no judge of scholarship in this field, the contents of this book seem at least to me to be impeccable, of great interest, and well worth 5 stars. As a physical object, however, this book is a piece of trash that Cambridge University Press ought to be ashamed at putting out, certainly at such a ridiculously high price, and hence the single star 
 The mouse worked great but the keyboard was very erratic. After my efforts to make it work failed, I called customer service. They do not have a toll free number but they handle the call as if they have one: there are long lists of menus to navigate through and they put you on hold forever. When someone answered the phone, I described the problem and he immediately said that the keyboard appeared defective and I should exchange it. The conversation lasted only 30 secs. Moreover, they only work from 10am to 7 pm M-F. So, I had to come homw from work to make this call.  The customer service person was nice but the whole setup is very poor and reflects badly on the company.   If the person in charge of customer service at this firm reads this, then please realize that your efforts to save money by not having toll free numbers and limited working hours will be frustrating to most customers who have come to expect a better service. With the nature of products you make, a person has to be with the product when they troubleshoot and for working people, that means having to go home during working hours.  On the whole, the wireless mouse was just awesome. I haven't worked with a functional version of their wireless keyboard yet 
 ...going to make money on nanotechnology within the next fifty years are stockbrokers and people like Jack Uldrich who -- for a fee of course -- will unveil their nanotechnology "expertise" and proffer advice accordingly...unfortunately, at this point, nanotechnology is little more than a fancy term -- practically speaking there is no tangible nanotechnology outside of research labs and what does exist is years away from commercial development...more pertinent in this particular case, Mr. Uldrich really provides no evidence to support his claim for "expertise" in the field of nanotechnolgy -- his resume shows only that he was a former naval intelligence officer and Defense Department official and also served as the Director of the Minnesota Office of Strategic and Long Range Planning under Governor Jesse Ventura...Jesse Ventura?...hmmmm, I'm not quite clear on how one acquires nanotechnology experience working for Jesse Ventura...moreover, his advice is basically free via columns he publishes every week on the "Motley Fool" website...no, I have to say this book is not recommended 
 If you claim to be Catholic but fail to subscribe to the Catholic Worker newspaper you are not Catholic. (available here)  If you claim to be Catholic yet support directly or indirectly the Iraqi war, you are not Catholic (read Gaudium et spes, Pacem in terris, Father John Dear)  Forget this externalist formalist farcical treatment of the one holy catholic and apostolic Church.   To know what it is to be Catholic in the flesh and heart and spirit, study the writings of Sister Ita Ford, or her bio by Sr. Noone. Study Benedictine Sister Joan Chittister, or Monica Hellwig.   Be a true (not just practicing) Catholic and study deeply the great American CAtholic theologian and scholar, the Rev. Father Richard McBrien's comprehensive tome: Catholicism, well received and respected for a generation.   Continue with other great Catholic and American theologians and scholars and saints and contemplatives such as Jesuit Fathers Daniel Berrigan and Father John DEar who dare ask the hard questions with intelligence, insight and spiritual orthodoxy to the Gospel of Jesus. In particular illuminating is Jesus the Rebel by the Rev. Father Dear, and the commentaries on the Old Testament prophets such as Job and Ezekial by the Rev. Father Berrigan.   Then neither Dummy nor Complete Idiot shall you be, but Catholic in mind, heart, spirit and soul. Continue with the great Saint, MArtyr and Confessor of the Faith, Archbishop Romero, and of course the other Salvadoran martyrs and confessors like Fr. Ellacuria and the still living (when last seen) Father Jon Sobrino.    Such a telling shame cornerstone Catholic texts such as Pope John XXIII's PACEM IN TERRIS and Pope PAul VI's POPULORUM PROGRESSIO or even the US Conference of Catholic Bishop's ever-more-important treatise on Just Cause/Just war entitled GOd's Challenge and Our Response are out of print and no longer available, as they truly call us to put our faith into concrete action for Christ. As the great St. James wrote: Faith without works is dead.   Please check my other reviews for further excellent sources as well as warnings about the ill sectarian and shallow observances.  
 This is not the worst book I've ever read, but it is very close!  It had potential to be a good read, but lacked in many key areas.  The characters were fairly interesting and decently developed individually, but the  outcome of all their interaction was not develped nearly enough.  The  entanglment of the characters had good plot potential, but ended up being  VERY anticlimactic.  I felt like the book was unfinished and probably  needed at least another hundred pages or so to round out the characters and  their situations.  It even felt as if it was published exactly as the first  draft was written, without any content editing, rewriting or further plot  development.  Every Day is Mother's Day is a book that had promise, but  fell quite short of it's potential 
 I have read several books on ADD and found this book to be full of the same old falacies and myths about Nutrition, medication and biofeedback as all the rest, and none of it works! It was a waste of my time and money. Don't bother!  The most helpful book that I have read is The ADD & ADHD answer Book by Dr. Susan AShley Ph.D. 
 This was originally published in 1911 and promulgates the author's task management system.  This was the beginning of the "scientific management" line of research and so is widely credited as being the first management science book.  The essay certainly provides an interesting window into an earlier time.  He also illustrates how implementation of management tools requires leadership for success.  Still, a reader shouldn't plan on taking away a great many lessons not available from other sources.  The book should appeal mainly to those specialists working in the field and to historians rather than most readers 
 I bought one of these last year, and put it up in our yard just five feet from the fence dividing our yard from the neighbor's yard.  This device completely failed to stop the neighbor's barking dog.  I could detect no effect whatsoever.  Save your money, and try something else.  I wish I could tell you what works, but we're still looking 
 I love The Crow Series but this film I'm going to pretend that it was never made. The acting by eddie furlong was not good because he got nothing to work with he did try and I saw that. But the worst performance in this film is by far tara reid she is a bad actress if she thinks she is good then look at her movie list(My Bosses Daughter, Alone in the Dark, Jossie and the pusscats, and Van Wilder.) You all know these movies sucks and she is a part of that cause. Back to the crow the love between the 2 couple is bland and the action was so stupid. I swear if you see closely you see the wires when they pretend to fly at each other. This felt like an Uwe Boll presentation, you'll feel like vomiting for every second you watch this film. This is not a true crow film it was a fan film with a cheap camera like again Uwe Boll and to me this movie never happened 
 As a white Boomer of 51, some of these songs were very familiar to me.  But most of the artists were 'one hit wonders.'  This is why I ordered the compliation.  The one song I really liked was "Kung Fu Fighting."  Remarkable that the lyrics in "Shaft" were so very limited.  The movie was much better.  
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 If you have little to no cartooning talent what so ever the go for this book. If you're halfway decent all ready dont bother. The writer/artist is an obvious amature and to my knowledge has never worked on a major comic. It does have a few good points but not many. I personaly found this book to be a waste of my time, if you are looking for a good instructional book for creating comics i suggest "HOW TO DRAW COMICS THE MARVEL WAY" which is much more in depth than Mr. Hart's book 
 1st Received - Had a button broken. Did work but right arrow would not click.  2nd (Replacement) - Did not transmit the bass. I almost bought a new stereo system for my car thinking my speakers were bad, but tested the product in 5 other cars and had the same problems.  I do not recommend this product.  Me and all my family have the previous version, with manual setting. That one is excellent and I will probably buy me one more of those 
 First off, I love Eddie Murphy.  In my opinion, he's one of the more brilliant talents to come out of SNL.  But it's a crying shame that sketches that were included on the original VHS version of "Eddie Murphy: Best of SNL" have been deleted from the DVD version.  My particular favorite piece (Eddie playing a rastafarian singing "we're gonna kill da white people" at a meeting of mostly white VFW members) is NOT on this DVD along with a number of others.  Have the SNL folks suddenly become squeamish and politically correct - I can only assume that such cowardice and overly correct behavior is at the root of such an obvious ommission.  After having owned the VHS version, I can honestly say that I regret having purchased the DVD.  I would return it if I could.  Listen to the other viewers and don't be fooled 
  This movie is one long journey to absolute nothingness. Sometimes my favorite parts in movies are the quiet one's. Movies with great moments of silence are great if they're necessary. Unfourtunately, while i appreciated the quiet introspection, i could not tolerate a whole movie like that. I will say Morvern Callar has a great opening, one that makes you wonder. The rest though is just...boring. I appreciated nothing else, and found it empty. Nothing was gained or lost, or learned.I cant recommend this to any one, unless you have to see every movie ever made 
 First off, I am an avid reader and love a long challenging read, however, this novel is one of the worst I have ever read! It is long, boring and has absolutely no plot. I purchased it when it first came out without reading any reviews. Although from the looks of most of them here, I personally suspect that many of those who raved, never actually read the book 
 I expected more from Baer after his "See no Evil". However, novel writing is a little different than non-fiction, especially when you are trying to write, based on solid experiences.  This novel lacks action, it is dull, predictable, pedestrian, slow, and the charcters are wooden and un-interesting. Therefore, it is a forgettable story. I still remember the first James Bond book I read many years ago. Having read Blow the House Down recently, the story is already forgotten and I could care less about the characters.  I think Baer has a lot to say, given the current political climate. However, as noted, I suggest he stick with what he knows and present it in a non-fiction format 
 Russo is passionate about reaching his audience--fundamentalist Christians---but the passion ultimately creates a non-scholarly book. It only plays on people's emotions.   In order to produce his thesis, Russo only regurgitates fear and stereotypes onto paper. His book is nothing more than the power of suggestion to people who don't have accurate information.   He believes that earth-based religions are bad only because they differ from what he is personally already familiar with. Oddly, he does not consider how such an attitude could then be used to `examine' ANY religion, including his own. I doubt he would be appreciative of being stereotyped.   People looking for real answers about Wicca and Witchcraft will assume that Russo knows what he is talking about---when this is far from the case. The extensive misinformation in this book would damage intra-family relations much more.    However, realizing that some readers of this book had opened it wanting genuine answers about the activities of their family, I am recommending an alternative.  "When Someone You Love Is Wiccan: A Guide to Witchcraft and Paganism for Concerned Friends, Nervous Parents, and Curious Co-Workers" by Carl McColman provides much better introductory advice.   
 As careful as I have been the pans are already warping and the finish on one is ruined.  The pots are no longer round so the lids do not fit properly - I cannot even use them to make rice as too much steam is released through the gap between the pot and the lid.  I have followed the instructions faithfully but have yet been able to keep the pans from sticking.  Frankly, they are not much better than the regular teflon after the coating has started coming off.  The information posted said they were ok for ceramic stoves but I cannot help but wonder if this is the problem as other people seem to think the pans are great.  I do like being able to use metal utensils with them but that's about the only good thing I can say 
 I got this toy for my 7 year old son for CHristmas. What a waste of $25.00. This tank is soooo flimsy. When I buy a Coke I get a stronger plastic!! [...]We followed instructions verbatim and have had NO luck.AVE YOUR MONEY. [... 
 Abridgements of great works in and of themselves are not a bad thing.  As I read through this volume I could not but help noticing how poorly it reflected upon Freeman's original three volume work.    Douglas Southall Freeman's Magnum Opus is distorted quite significantly in this abridgement.  If you have not read his original work I suppose this volume will suffice.  But why settle?  I frequently come across the original volumes at used bookstores for around $50-$60.    Mr. Freeman's writing is good literature apart from being great history.  Though the original work is dated it still is a magnificient example of historical writing.  Mr. Freeman's work is what got me interested in Civil War history.     
 I purchased this for my daughter's birthday. I'm sending it back because it is not worth the 6.99. What a waste of money. Just a few pages of stickers and the page count includes the back of the sticker pages that are blank. Don't bother 
 I rented this on a whim and it brought back a lot of memories from my 1970s days in elementary school.  This video made its rounds in the public schools.  The songs are catchy and the film quality is good.    But make no mistake, this is propaganda aimed at children.  I will not be showing it to my kids.  Despite the freewheeling title, the message is that girls will find happiness only if they mimic boys.    Case in point:  Atalanta, a princess, finds happiness when she competes with men in a footrace and when she rejects marriage so she can travel the world (on her father's horse).  She also designs and fabricates rocketships in her spare time.  Juxtapose that story with another cartoon where a femine girl in a pink dress and curls is devoured by tigers when she follows the custom of "ladies first."  The tigers abide her request and throw her into a boiling cauldron.  The narrator advises us that the boiling girl makes a very tasty meal.  Our "hosts", infant puppets voiced by Mel Brooks and Marlo Thomas, are revolting.  There should be a law against using Mel Brooks' voice for a baby.  Apparently, I repressed memories of these creatures, but seeing them again brought back the horror.  Needless to say, I fast forwarded through the disturbing puppetry.  Overall, this DVD is fun for thirtysomethings but should be kept away from children 
 I bought this DVD for my husband and 2 boys as a Father's Day gift & we were all quite disappointed. Instead of action-packed, it's amateur video clips & boring narration. Save your (... 
 This movie was awful. The main reason was, it is just too unrealistic. You have "angels" played by people like scatman crothers and Charles Durning as well as the Devil played by the now later Oliver Reed coiming into the middle of the scenes and "fast forwarding" and "freezing".......just not realistic at all. Plus you have travolta as an inventor. Edible sunglasses? Yes I know not all movies have to be 100% realistic but this movie just goes too far. I watched it because Grease was such a great movie but this movie just is pathetic, even compared to an average movie, let alone Grease.  On the bright side however, the theme song "twist of fate" is one of the best songs of all time and the video is equally awesome. I think I may have just bought the movie to hear the theme song 
 I believe no matter what you have been through and what your current situation is, when it's time for you to meet Mr. Right. You will simply meet him, no books or methods will enhance the opportunity or present itself because of some "How 2 Make a Man Love You" book. Love isn't forced and a man will either love you or he will not. Save your money! When its time, its time and it will be worked out in the Master Plan! : 
 You must know by now, the prize for determining longitude at sea prior to satalites, etc. A race between the sextant types (astronomy) and the creation of a clock that does not lose time at sea(now available at all malls). If your interest lies with navigation, as does mine, this isn't your book.  If your interest lies in the historic quest for the perfect clock, even though the author doesn't really go into why and how this clock is such so superior to others (ie the engineering), then this book is for you 
 The major part of this book is made up of two page wide, single line entries for each fund. Entries consist of the usual stats available for free on-line. It would be worth the price to have this information neatly bound in a book - if the data was current, but it isn't. November 1998 mutual fund data is not much use in November 2001 (will this bull market ever end?). No fault of the authors - but not a good buy now 
 A little wordy.  Suggsted for serious work not for casual reader 
 I agree with the other reviewer that this is an incredibly boring book. It should be a crime to take so many fascinating projects, problems, and people and turn them into endless, dry, droning lists. There IS no narrative to the book. It reads like a Google search on technology...without any of the interest added by being able to check out the links. I bought the book because I heard the author in an interview, and he was very interesting. Too bad none of that comes through in the book 
 Donald O'Connor was great in Singing in the Rain. Der Bingle. Mitzi Gaynor. A Cole Porter score. P.G. Wodehouse on the script. How can anything go wrong? The arrangements were too dull for a memorial service. O'Connor and Gaynor danced on the deck of a cruise ship, but they tried to copy Astaire and Rogers and failed. And the love scenes? They missed the part in the script where the protagonists interact in a way that is a prelude to romance. They are suddenly just in love. Then the two females get headaches, but they weren't the only ones. Don't try to make sense of this one. It is simply a footnote in movie history to show how and why musicals disappeared from production schedules by the 1960s 
 HORRIBLY loud, when I use the food processor i have to leave the room because of the high pitch screech (sp?), and it's still bad in the other room.    Does NOT work well, when i make hummus the liquid comes out the sides, when I make a smoothie it takes forever to get smooth.  I really thought it would be nice to have a 2 in 1 appliance, but this is not the one 
 This woman may have a great body, but she cannot teach dancing for anything. In the 35 minute 'cardio dance' portion, dance steps are taught frustratingly fast (and this is from somebody that enjoys dancing!).  It took so long to figure out the steps--which are not your 'typical' exercise or step class steps--that I shut the DVD off and jumped on the treadmill.    The two 15 minute hip and thigh workouts are a little better, but you really need to do them both back-to-back to feel any benefits. I would say this is a good video for anybody thats got LOTS of patience to learn the moves and an alternate workout for the first few times you run the DVD, because you'll get no benefit from the workout while trying to figure out what she's doing.  Save your money!  
 This album isn't not very good at all.  There are about four songs I like.  First off, the production on this CD is disgusting considering some of the producers make great beats.  Then, the guest artists do a sub-par job lyrically.  Then, there are no new verses from Biggie, on the album.  They should have stopped with Born Again, because album will be a forgotten one, not a great way to close out the legecy of Bigge Smalls 
 What makes this book such tough sledding for the amateur historian? Is it because the book was translated from German to English? Whatever the cause, reading the book is as captivating as reading a similar account from an encyclopedia. It is more like reading a technical report than a book. Now the good news; the book is logically constructed, flows well, and has a dauntingly thorough bibliography. If you muster the self discipline to stay with the author, you will be rewarded with a deep knowledge of the Goths. It is a book by a historian for other academics. Frankly, there are more readable books on the subject available from other authors.   
 [...] For an excellent rebuttal of Dombrowski and Deltete's pro-abortion position, see the first chapter of Robert P. George's 'The Clash of Orthodoxies.' George, a Roman Catholic, is a professor at Princeton University.  The following is an excerpt from the Seattle Catholic article by Anne Barbeau Gardiner:  The authors make a sharp distinction between the unborn child being "merely human" (i.e., having human parents and genes) and being "a human person in some morally relevant sense." Their most striking and pervasive analogy in support of this distinction is the one between an unborn child and vegetation, as when they say, "The early fetus is obviously alive, as is grass."  In their view, the unborn child is like vegetation until very late in the pregnancy when sentience begins, a term they define as the capacity to perceive pain. They argue that sentience arises only when the central nervous system is functioning. Oh, but what a slippery slope this is! They keep shifting the date when the unborn child attains this mysterious quality. First they say it is hard to tell if there is "a morally considerable being at twenty-four weeks of pregnancy or not until twenty-eight weeks." As it turns out, they are unsure the unborn child has sentience until the eighth month. Even then they declare vaguely that "the fetus becomes morally considerable between twenty-four and thirty-two weeks when sentiency, and then the cerebral cortex, starts to function." The thirty-second week verges on the ninth month!  The authors inform us that performing an abortion on a "nonsentient" child (which, as we have just seen, can be up to the eighth month) is like mowing the lawn. Here are their very words: "It is unclear to us, however, why killing a nonsentient being is rash or precipitous. We do it all the time with equanimity when we mow the grass." Elsewhere they say that an abortion is "like pruning one's rose bush." These are chilling analogies. But do they actually work as analogies? No. For when one prunes a rosebush, it is to make it bloom more abundantly; when one mows the grass, it is to make it grow thicker and stronger. But when one aborts a child, does that child's capacity to grow improve? Not a bit. Little wonder that the authors attack the pro-life film The Silent Scream as being "at best, misleading, and, at worst, fraudulent." This heartrending film shows an unborn child in the throes of an abortion and makes it plain that there is no likeness here to grass or a rosebush. As ultrasounds reveal, a child in the womb reacts to touch after eight weeks, something that grass and a rosebush cannot do at any stage. .. 
 We got this for our kids who are big Pirates fans. This toy should never have been released, it's a piece of junk to make a quick buck from the movie.  It's a junky non-functional ripoff of the classic Viewmaster concept, and while my kids (3 & 6) can work Viewmaster, this telescope in no way works--there are several MAJOR design flaws.  The disks holding the picture don't center so the pic won't show up, the disk pops out when you try to turn to the next picture and won't stay in if you so much as move the telescope, you can't even see the picture unless the telescope is totally collapsed (which is tough, since the wobbly piece of junk won't stay shut).  And IF your kid can get all this stuff right, you are rewarded with... A BLURRY barely visible image. I've bought a lot of toys and don't always expect perfection, but this is seriously the junkiest hunk of *$#* I have ever purchased.  Whoever churned this out in time for the P.o.t.C. marketing blitz has surely never met any kids or any quality control personnel.  I wish I could give less than one star.  Thank God the designer of this is only making children's toys and not airplanes or cars 
 I bought this DVD because a friend said it was one of the funniest films he had ever seen. We're still friends, but I'll never listen to one of his reviews again--our taste must not be compatible.  My wife, daughter, and I seldom agree on anything but we unanimously consider this the worst movie we've ever seen. It's the only movie I've ever turned off before the end.  On the plus side, watching most of this film has given me a new perspective on cinema. I used to think I knew bad movies. Now I know that most movies are at least pretty good, and it's only a very few that are truly bad. This is one of those very few bad films.  Best in Show belongs to a genre of "comedies" that I find boring at best, but often cruel and mean. Other films of this type are "Waiting for Guffman", "Bottle Rocket", etc. If you enjoy watching pathetic people struggle then perhaps you'll appreciate this movie 
 I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.  
 I have been a die-hard Star Trek fan since preschool.  I was a fan when we were still called trekkies.  I can recite pointless details about warp nacelle design theory till I'm blue in the face, and up until now, I have been a staunch defender of this franchise's various incarnations, good or bad.  But this movie is simply unacceptable.    Stylisticly, it differs tremendously from the tone of the Next Generation series.  And let me just go on record as saying, I am SO tired of seeing the cast brandishing phaser rifles.  I realize the filmmakers wanted to make a film that catered to a broader audience, rather than to merely trekkers, but in so trying, what they actually did was create a movie that is appealing to neither.    I would also like to know why Jonathan Frakes wasn't allowed to direct this movie.  He directed First Contact spectacularly and even managed to make the inferior Insurrection work.  He clearly has an intuition for why people enjoy watching the Next Generation cast and what they expect to see in a Star Trek film.  Last but not least, why were so many good scenes cut out of the final version?  The Next Gen cast deserved a better swan song 
 I recently bought this movie after reading the reviews on Amazon but I ended up being disappointed...despite Chicken Man's best efforts. My main grumble is the inactivity of Sgt. Stedanko. All he does in this movie is smoke pot, mumble aimlessly and then turn into a lizard!! Things are much better when he's clear-headed and on the case.  There are some redeeming moments in the film, namely the mental asylum scenes (where we meet Chicken Man) and also the Chinese restaurant madness...oh (...)  However, the rest of the movie just ambles along. I think the only funny moment in the first half of the movie is when we see a lizard smoking pot. In fact I think Mr Chong was suffering from a strange fascination with these reptiles and unfortunately lost all focus on making a good movie. OK man 
 Most of the items were fine. They were just given as gifts with 4 damaged. I have tried to return without success. I am disappointed that I am not able to return damaged or not functioning items. I may think twice about ever doing this agai 
 Williamson might be a leading figure in his field, but he can't seem to organize ideas to save his life.  It's almost as though he wrote the book in one stream of consciousness, and no one ever went back to check that things flowed, language made sense, etc.  One of the most painful books I've ever read 
 The first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat "hero" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed 
 In the item notes for this DVD it claims it is remastered. Though it is not as poor quality as the 2004 DVD, it still has black dots and white scratches in the picture. Is CBS the only place you can find the completely remastered version? This is NOT worth $14.99, more like $4.99. Remaster the thing or don't supply it. : 
 The 6th edition of this text was released in 2005, but should be roughly 608 pages. This is listed as such in another listing under the same title, though the softcover info for this text also seems to be incorrect. If this is the correct text the list price is also significantly higher for new texts.  Double check before you buy ... though I tried and couldn't figure out how to do so 
 Looks like Hewitt got the color wrong: his prescription is relegating the Repubican Party to the areas of only *part* of the former Confederacy.  And even that part is shrinking 
 While Berlant is quite definatly a good cultural theorist, the type of work she does is problematic. This book regularly tries to define a national mindset in relation to the productions of a small number of people. While one might be able to analyze any number of the texts mentioned in this book, Berlant insists on saying that these texts relate to a particular way of thinking that are shared by at least a majority of our population (enough to elect republicans to the presidency). She repeatedly uses really loaded/offensive terms, which can be fun if you politically agree with her (for instance patriotism=infantile citizenship, heterosexuality=dead sexuality), but if you disagree even slightly with her they seem mostly like bullying. While I'm rather left leaning, the core of her arguement, that right leaning people vote more based on emotions rather than well thought out ideas, I find to be mostly baseless (I think a misunderstanding of economics and international politics are the reason people vote republican... or immense wealth). Since most of the textual examples she uses I don't think can ever adequatly stand for the majority of the people she claims they represent, and are more caricatures of poltical discourse (which of course most political discourse is) rather than actual personal poltics, her work comes across as being based on a confusion of aggressiveness and refrences to Lacan with strong theorizing.  Unless you want to get into arguements with friends who really like this book, I'd pass it up if I were you

 Let me first say that I did not purchase this mini stepper through Amazon, but rather directly from the Discovery Channel Store. Two weeks after I submitted my review of their product on their web site, however, they still have not seen fit to post it.  I used the Discovery Electronic Mini Stepper daily for 29 days (30 minutes per day) before the cable around the pulley-wheel broke. This seems to be a consistent problem with this piece of equipment, judging by previous reviews on the DCS (Discover Channel Store) web site. Being inside the 30 day return window, I sent my stepper back for a refund. Customer service, I must say, was excellent...only the product itself was cheap and substandard.  On a related note, this is the third mini stepper (various brands, not all DCS) I have owned in the past year. They have all broken down in one way or another. Feel free to look at some of my previous reviews here to get the details, but the bottom line is that this will be my last mini stepper.  Take some advice from me when I say that these machines are built for people who are beginners in the world of fitness. That is to say, if you intend to use a mini stepper two or three days per week for 15-20 minutes, then you may be satisfied with one. However, if you are at an advanced or even intermediate stage in your workout routine, then don't even consider one of these machines - you will destroy it, trust me. There's just too much that can go wrong -- pulleys cracking, pulley cables breaking, shocks leaking...and I actually broke the frame of one stepper. Through all of this, I have learned one important lesson about exercise: keep it simple. I am now having great success with some simple resistance bands (many varieties are available here at Amazon) and cardiovascular exercises (e.g. regular old jumping-jacks). I get a better workout than any I ever got from a mini stepper, and I'm feeling great and even lost a little weight in the right places :-)  Honestly, if you want to save yourself some grief, please learn from my experiences and avoid the horrible cycle of mini stepper destruction. Just buy yourself some resistance bands, maybe a jump rope, an exercise mat, an instructional video/book, and then get to work. Exercising to tone your body and lose weight isn't easy (and if it is, then you're probably not doing it right), but you can make it easier by not wasting your time and money on junk like this 
 Okay, I bought this because I read the specifications on the product page and saw that it featured a Japanese language track. "Finally!" I thought, "I'll get to see Pocket Monsters as it was intended to be seen!" I guess I should have known better, but I was nonetheless furious when I popped in the first disc and the butchered English version was the only language track available.  I think I'm most angry at Amazon for the blatant lies that are featured on its product page. Shame on you, Amazon, for flat-out lying to your custsomers. Had I known only the English track was available, I would have never preordered it. The only reason I bought it in the first place was so that I could enjoy Pocket Monsters in Japanese. Thanks for nothing, guys; I'm returning this disappointment as soon as possible. 
 I was really looking forward to this book.  A book that discusses the aspects of each of the congregations in the US or world is a great reference tool in understanding what others believe.  Is this book the one to choose for that purpose?  First, I will discuss its contents, pros and cons before giving my final opinion.  Rhodes' book begins with a very short history of the church (4 pages).  He then defines 'denomination,' 'protestant' and gives a description of how to use the book.  The books covers the following churches: Adventists Baptists Brethren Catholic Christian Congregational Episcopalian and Anglican Friends (Quaker) Fundamentalist and Bible Holiness Lutheran Mennonite Methodist Orthodox Pentecostal Presbyterian Reformed  With each congregation, Rhodes begins with a date of origin for the church, census of members and number of congregations.  He then describes their beliefs and gives a chart of fast facts for the church.  There are several added "fast fact" charts that detail theologies such as Calvinist and Arminian.  Each congregation gets 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 pages (except the Roman Catholic Church where 10 pages are written.)  Some congregations have a robust history leading into discussion of the divisions within, such as the Orthodox church.  Pros: --A large swath of churches is covered.   --A good index aids in finding churches.  For instance, I wanted to find out what the Nazarene church was like, and the index pointed me to the Holiness section, which I was not aware they were part of. --There is an index of persons that helps in determining which authors are from which church. --Rhodes speaks from an unbiased viewpoint.  One could not tell he is conservative dispensational Protestant from this writing.  Cons: --Rhodes left out a couple of churches I have wanted to learn about in my town, namely Unitarian.  Granted, many do not consider the Unitarian church to be strictly Christian, but it is a prominent congregation that would be helpful to have in the book. --The book is VERY vague about church beliefs.  Many of the churches described deny the inerrancy of Scripture, but that can not be determined by the wording used, as the writing makes little distinction between those that call the Scriptures inerrant and those that do not.  One must read between the lines or have some knowledge of the church to discern Rhodes' writing.  Views of Scripture is only one of the vagueries, but is the most prominent. --The book does NOT discuss the issues that set the churches apart.  Worship is spoken about, again, in vague terms.  Is Christ present in the Eucharist of the Lutheran churches?  One cannot tell from this book.  (Some Lutheran churches do teach this and some don't.)  Which churches put high focus on speaking in tongues?  One cannot tell from this book.  My greatest critique is vagueness.  Granted, Rhodes could not have been very specific without relying on some theological bias.  But, more specifics could be told.  From this book, it is very hard to tell why there are divisions.  What divides the American Baptists from the Southern Baptists?  Episcopalian from Anglican?  Greek Orthodox from Orthodox Church in America?  Volumes could be written, but little of it could be found out in this writing.     Is this book the one to choose for the purpose of understanding other congregations?  I have to give a resounding no.  The breadth of this book is a blessing and a curse.  He doesn't leave many out, but the book would have to be much longer to give any insight into the differences between the congregations discussed 
 "Journey to the West" is a literary masterpiece which has been loved in China for nearly half a millennium.  In contrast, "The Lost Empire" is a piece of meretricious rubbish which will hopefully soon be consigned to oblivion.  Its makers seem to assume, rightly or wrongly, that its audience will be unable to relate to a "foreign" story unless a white guy is inserted, however incongruously, into the action.  As if this were not bad enough, the idea of the "hero" comducting a romantic affair with Kuan Yin must be deeply offensive to many people of Chinese extraction.  Since Kuan Yin is someimes compared, in her role as compassionate mediator, to the Virgin Mary, one can only imagine the response had the situation been reversed.  This is an example of film-making at its very worst 
 One just doesn't get the chance to use a dandy word like "execrable" that often, but there's no better word for Ben Belitt's translations.  'nuff said.  On the other hand, the poems themselves are magnificent.  If you have enough Spanish to catch their rhythms you can appreciate them without letting the ghastly translations spoil your enjoyment.  
 This book takes an interesting topic like functional programming and makes it hideously boring.  In retrospect, I wish I'd bought Hudak's book instead.  I read a review claiming that Mr. Thompson's book was better for newcomers to Haskell than Mr. Hudak's.  I don't know where this idea came from; I later borrowed Hudak's "Haskell School of Expression" and found it to be more informative and faster-paced than this book.  I give it two stars only because it is useful as a reference.  If you're looking to learn Haskell and do cool things with it, get School of Expression instead 
 When it comes to cheap productions, this awful little mess should rank near the top of the (garbage) heap.  Script, acting, and production values are nil, and it appears that the whole thing was shot with a home video camera; however, it is far less entertaining than the average home video.  It is an utterly pointless waste of time and money, and should be marketed only as a cure for insomnia.  When compared with the bozos who made this film, Ed Wood looks like Cecil B. DeMille, and that is a notable accomplishment indeed.  The size of the budget does not determine the quality of the film; however, when coupled with a dull and pointless script, sleepwalking actors, and the incredible ineptitude of the writer/director, the low budget doesn't exactly recommend it.  Admirers of this film are certainly welcome to it; those of us who are evidently not as intellectually gifted can live without it.  The debate over this film is rather like the story, "The Emperor's New Clothes", in that those who look hard enough for something will generally see it, whether it exists or not.  This sorry mess isn't worth the pomposity and arrogance with which some persons choose to approach it.  Personally, I find this film to be an abject waste, so number me among the numbskulls.      
 NOT A LOT ELSE TO BE HONEST.  So many people have been fooled in to believing this band is amazing simply because of the speed that they play at, but to be honest is speed really everything?  All the songs on the CD lack creativity and sounds pretty much the same as the last song .  Every fu**ing track on this album is plagued with fast drum beats, some crappy power metal riff that remains throughout the song and lightning fast guitar solos which is impressive when you've heard one but by the end of the CD its a drag.  Don't get me wrong, to be able to play this takes a hell of a lot of skill and ability, but they need to use that skill and ability to come up with something a lot more creative and inventive 
 The two main characters are so irritating that you never get to identify with them.They never shut up and run off about their bosses "business" in settings that would get them popped post haste in anything approximating reality. Huge suspension of disbelief needed for this one. Not enjoyable at all. It is actually irratating. The DVD case is worth more than the DVD. 
 I was very disappointed after reading all the glowing reviews for this movie and then watching your average "bad guys on the run" movie.  Gee, Billy Bob Thornton plays a crazy bad guy who shoots people and he doesn't like cops at all; he even uses bad language!  A friend was watching it with me and he thought I was watching the Lifetime channel. This movie just plodded along down cliche boulevard 
 It is noteworthy that almost all of the reviews for this book are either 5 stars or 1 star. It therefore seems like this book does not do a good job convincing the reader of an opinion he or she did not hold before reading it. People disbelieving evolution, I am sure, will find in this book "intellectual" justification of their preexisting beliefs. Those who trust evolution will hate it. But there is another type of readers here too, of which I consider myself one: we believe in evolution but are open minded enough (or at least we cherish the pleasure of proving ourselves wrong, utterly wrong, about a belief we have been hosting for a long time) to read an opposing viewpoint. If you are like me, this book will disappoint you--it will strengthen your belief in evolution. Whereas in the past you entertained the doubt that somewhere out there were excellent books perhaps disproving evolution but yet remaining still unread by you, you will finish this book with an exclamation: "Is this what the fuss is all about?" True, there could be other similar books that do a better job at countering the theory of evolution. However, based on the glowing reviews I am reading here, I gather that this book is one of the best their camp has to offer. If so, then I feel sorry indeed for their side of the argument.   Do I recommend this book to those like me? It is a hard question. Yes and No. Yes, because without reading it, you may still secretly harbor the suspicion that there is maybe a healthy intellectual alternative to evolution--and this books speaks to the opposite of this thought. No, because I do not want you to waste your money and time. The arguments contained in this book are contorted and so easy to refute that you cannot help but be amazed at the ease with which otherwise wise human brains can deceive themselves in order to continue to cherish a sweet illusion. An example of such an argument? I have time only for one. "There are gaps in the archeological documentation of the gradual evolution!" Ok, so what? Are you proposing to jettison any theory that does not have a perfect record of evidence? Why not instead settle with evidence warranting a belief beyond reasonable doubt? According to the authors of this book, a prosecutor needs to let free a suspect, despite him holding a knife dripping with the blood of the victim, just because this prosecutor cannot generate a full account of all the thought processes that have taken place in the suspect's head since his birth 80 years ago... And then the example of "Well, how could a wind build a Boeing by chance alone?" Tiring ... only a person without a modicum of understanding of natural selection and of the power of endless time could seriously ask such an uninformed question.   To be completely fair, the book contains an excellent essay on Causality, which is somewhat our of place in this book, but which is nonetheless an outstanding take on the concept of Causality in the tradition of Kant and Hume. It is because of this essay that I am giving this book two stars. Otherwise, I share the sentiments expressed in Daniel Dennett's short letter to one of the authors, a letter included in the book: sheer frustration at the intellectual dishonesty and/illusion of the authors. 
 First off, I love Eddie Murphy.  In my opinion, he's one of the more brilliant talents to come out of SNL.  But it's a crying shame that sketches that were included on the original VHS version of "Eddie Murphy: Best of SNL" have been deleted from the DVD version.  My particular favorite piece (Eddie playing a rastafarian singing "we're gonna kill da white people" at a meeting of mostly white VFW members) is NOT on this DVD along with a number of others.  Have the SNL folks suddenly become squeamish and politically correct - I can only assume that such cowardice and overly correct behavior is at the root of such an obvious ommission.  After having owned the VHS version, I can honestly say that I regret having purchased the DVD.  I would return it if I could.  Listen to the other viewers and don't be fooled 
 When I bought the book I did not know that they already made a movie out of it but I learned about it later on. So I was really excited when I started to read it - also because other comments were really good. Unfortunately the book could not live up to my expectations at all.  First the story development is really slow- it takes an awful lot of pages before the actual crime happens.  Second, several passages in the book do not contribute anything vital at all to the story but only slow down the pace significantly.  The worst part of the book though is its style: It does not matter if a person really contributes anything at all to the story or the crime - he/she gets an extensive characterization. Most of them are several pages long and bore the hell out of the reader. Without this absolutely unnecessary amount of information this book easily could be about 200 pages shorter.  But even if the pace is slow and the book should be shorter, couldn't it still be an interesting book? Unfortunately those of you who hope to find a decent crime story will be disappointed big time as well. The detective aspect is so simple it could be told in less than 100 pages. On top of that the solution to the crime is so simple that after the first clue you know who the murderer is - and wonder why you need to go through over 200 pages to find out officially.  Conclusion: If you are a psychologist and/or like in-depth character studies this is exactly the right book for you. BUT for those of you who like fast-paced stories, ample twist and turns, surprises, action, thrilling developments and/or elaborate detective stories this book will be an absolute waste of your time. Please do not come anyway near it. Watch the movie instead - this way you will see some really great actors and are over with it in 2 hours 
 This book is rediculously boring. How a person can actually put their name on a piece of writing that so bad leaves me dumb founded. If anyone can find me anything similar to Cliff's Notes for this book, I'd love you forever, because in 1 month I've read 100 pages, and I'm 1 of those that actually enjoys reading. It had facts, but that's about it. Wow a summer well wasted.. 
 I think Apple's best products are those designed to do just one thing.  By focusing one one task, the unneccessary complexity and useless features are kept to a minimum.  But I was intrigued by this book since my dream is an iPod that also does what a Palm does.    Unfortunately, Steve Jobs does not share my desire for this simple goal.  I bought this book thinking there really was a way to expand my iPod's data handling ability.  Well, there are ways but as Ihnatko clearly points out they are simply too difficlut to bother with.  I give him two stars for being honest about the hassles involved in trying to make an iPod do what its not intended to do.  So...we will have iPods that let you watch Desperate Housewives in 3D, but an iPod with a voice recorder, memory card slot and the ability to make and retrieve notes appears to be an impossible dream.  Of course that's not the fault of this book.  The fact that its possible to write a 250 page book on how to use a music player is pretty scary.  
 ...after two months, a piece of the filter broke off.  After 3 months, the carafe cracked and sent coffee and glass spilling everywhere.  Cuisinart was kind enough to direct me to their website, so I could pay another $30 or so for a new carafe, because glass is not included in their warranty.  No thanks 
 If you love hip hop then don't buy this video. It's a mix of movements that are NOT hip hop 
 That is what this book should be used for--target practice. Not a single tale is remotely bloodcurdling. More than a dozen yawns went unsurpressed while attemptly with foolhardy optimism to complete this pedestrian compilation. Why stifle a yawn, that'll kill ya. STAY AWAY 
 This product could put user/customer's life at risk. The mapping software navigates user turning into a one way street and takes you to a very remote off-road. This is the worst product that I have used in my life. 
 The author cites the evolutionary and empirical evidence of modern day science and presents a convincing picture for justification of God, then completely deviates from reason and fact and concludes that science is a type of mythology - that we know nothing.  It was a boring read but I hoped for a climatic or at least informative ending...neither manifested.  
 Morris has a way of writing that enables the reader to get deep into a character's psyche, and this book was no exception. Each character in this book is in some way intensely desperate, and very real. Morris' writing style is incredible, her descriptions sharp, and her pacing satisfying.  That said, this is one of the most depressing books I've ever read. Nothing good happens until page 266, and it was a tough, tough read up to that point. I had to push myself to finish it. While Morris' writing is phenomenal, this just isn't the way I want to spend my free time 
 Short version: A half dozen scientists and engineers are working in the arctic, attempting to use explosives to create a huge iceberg that can floated to someplace in dire need of fresh water. They become marooned and only have a few hours before the explosives they've planted go off and kill them. However, a Russian sub may be able to save them.  Koontz had the right idea when he originally released this book under a pseudonym, because it's a stinker.  The set-up building to the scientists being stranded and the deadline imposed by the explosives is unbelievable. Suffice it to say that a natural disaster hundreds of miles away just happens to target the exact location of where the scientists are working. Additionally, they've planted explosives in the ice that are on timers and can't be switched off.  Besides suffering from incompetence, the characters have unbelievably bad luck (beyond being targeted for destruction by Mother Nature, that is):   -One is highly phobic, terrified of (you guessed it): ice & snow (because of an accident that killed her parents)! -Another's family was murdered in China -Another's had close relatives assasinated while in office and is disillusioned by politics (a thinly disguised JFK jr?) -Another lost his son to cancer -Another's psychotic  If that's not bad enough, the main characters are a husband and wife team who run the project. She had a relationship with another scientist that ended badly before getting married to the current guy. So who does her husband pick to spend months on ice with? Why the ex-boyfriend of course! Because he was the best at what he did (excuse me, wouldn't second best have made more sense?)  If you don't mind really bad dialog and trite situations, give this book a try. If you want a really intense adventure/thriller try Wilbur Smith's "Hungry as the Sea" or anything by Nelson DeMille 
 Recomendations for setting up a new kitchen good.  The rest is poo 
 This past August, I had bought the soundtrack to Pete Townsend's 1989 musical The Iron Man, which was also based on Ted Hughes's 1968 novel, and was impressed not only with Mr. Townsend's artistry, but also with the wisdom of the message that its songs conveyed as individual selections on an entire album that was just plain fun to listen to. Naturally, I thus came to thinking that maybe this motion picture, which was released a whole decade after that particular CD, would likely appeal to my imagination in the same way the musical would have, had I only the opportunity to see the latter presentation myself. Unfortunately, I found out how wrong I was when I rented this rightfully less-than-appreciated flick last weekend and forced myself to sit through it.  Now, I'll admit, the animation was definitely something worthy of applause; that's the ONE thing I'll give The Iron Giant credit for. However, that's as far as my praise for this movie goes. I'll also admit that it didn't follow the exact same lines as either the book or the musical, but then again, I was expecting that to be the case. Rather, it was the overall tone of the film that earned my enmity. To begin with, though I am well aware that many animated features and other family-themed features contain the occasional sight gag or adult-themed joke, TIG seemed to be heavily punctuated with them, from beatnik scrap-sculptor Dean McChoppin unzipping his fly to let young Hogarth Hughes's "pet" squirrel escape his pants to the "bathroom" scene where Hogarth tries to cover for the robot's hand as it exits the Hughes's home--the latter scene of which has AT LEAST two instances of what one could easily call "toilet-bowl humor." Not only that, but I found the protagonist himself to be just the most obnoxious and repulsive example of a lead character I have ever come to know: a loud, unruly, disobedient brat reminiscent of all four of young Charlie Bucket's tourmates from Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory who tries to pass himself off as having more depth than he really has. Honestly, he's NOT what I would call "amiable," "heart-warming," or even "cute"; such adjectives I'd rather reserve for the wide-eyed, honest, poverty-stricken Mr. Bucket. Of course, it's not like I really appreciated any of the other human characters in this flick, either--not little Mr. Hughes's ridiculously clueless diner waitress mother Annie, nor the deadbeat wannabe "artist" Dean, nor even the inept government agent whose name I have completely (yet thankfully) forgotten despite his being the most complex Earthling participant in the entire cartoon. As such, only the hundred-foot-tall, metal-munching robot--a softhearted and self-maintaining (if nonetheless hopelessly brain-damaged) extraterrestrial being who has no memory at all of his origin--impressed me. Even so, the movie portrayed the poor guy as being so incredibly dimwitted (as opposed to being haplessly misguided and a tad naive, which I was hoping he'd come off as being) in an effort to make him likeable to the kids in the audience that I ended up pitying him more than anything else. Needless to say, then, as much as I tried to grapple with each and every one of these elements as they presented themselves, I merely found it harder and harder to get over and accept them all as a collective whole, and I ended up returning this movie to the video store in utter disgust.  Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, I really tried to appreciate The Iron Giant, but despite my efforts in trying to see the side of the story that its fans see in it, all was for naught, and now I am left asking myself as to just why I even bothered to rent it in the first place. After all, it has been known to be one of a number of very unpopular motion pictures from 1999, and with good reason: It caters to a very low level of mentality, even amongst the underdeveloped minds of the kids for whom it was made. Tragically, so do many other movies these days, regardless of how successful or unsuccessful they are--a current, seven-plus-year-long fad that honestly disturbs me and gets me wondering about the sensibility of the average person these days. Worse yet is how a movie as plagued with such lowbrow buffoonery as this one would have a "special edition" on DVD five years after its initial release--especially considering how allegedly few people have actually seen it. Oh, well...I still wish I could've seen Pete Townsend's Iron Man musical. At least THAT would have been something worth witnessing 
 The most surprising aspect of this 2006 thrill ride of a movie is that at ninety minutes, it is almost a half-hour shorter than its 1972 predecessor, a blessing really given that director Wolfgang Peterson seems only interested in filming the action sequences. An inspired choice for the remake, the veteran director has already proven a sharp acumen for providing exceedingly cramped, seafaring adventures with his classic WWII submarine movie, "Das Boot" and the more recent fishing trip-gone-wrong, "The Perfect Storm". The offsetting problem, however, is that Mark Protosevich's trite screenplay abbreviates character development in favor of banal dialogue and stock responses. The net result is that there is little concern for the fate of any of the characters, especially the women who look interchangeable when soaked, no matter how dire the consequences.  Peterson wastes little time, barely fifteen minutes, in setting up the ten key characters for the big tidal wave. From that point, he combines predictably spectacular CGI effects with outsized set pieces to dramatize the familiar journey this group takes to find their way to the hull where they seek safety. The one indisputable improvement over the original is the way Peterson effectively shows the fast elevating water level in a more realistic way, especially in having the characters swim a lot more through the submerged air shafts. Less realistic is the way all the characters appear to swim at Olympian levels in their ability to forego oxygen for lengthy periods. But the set-up gets repetitive, and the only diversion, albeit a minor one, is figuring out which character will be killed next.  As the alpha male, Josh Lucas cuts a reasonable action figure playing the Gene Hackman hero role though a more mercenary type given that his character is a professional gambler. Relegated to second lead, Kurt Russell seems to be inheriting Ernest Borgnine's role but not as a blowhard cop but as the sensitive former mayor of New York (huh?). They argue periodically about what path to take, but that's the only relationship that has any semblance to reality in the film. With no one as colorful as Shelley Winters or Stella Stevens this time, the rest of the actors barely register, including wide-eyed Emmy Rossum playing Russell's conflicted daughter and Jacinda Barrett as the brave mother of a predictably precocious son.  The biggest waste is the normally colorful Richard Dreyfuss cast rather pathetically as a gay, suicidal architect who barely says a word once the action starts. The climax gets quite convoluted in its technicalities, and then it simply ends. There are nine minutes of end credits at the end listing the multitudes who worked on the special effects. The two-disc 2006 DVD is strictly for aficionados of this genre of film with several "making of" featurettes and a History Channel documentary which looks at the possibility of such waves wreaking such havoc. Surprisingly, there is little reference to the 1972 inspiration directed by Ronald Neame. And consequntly, there is barely enough to hold interest over the course of two discs. An unmemorable viewing experience overall 
 I was so excited to receive this book, and can not believe how dissapointing it is!!  The people aren't urban explorers (UErs for short) - they are children who dress up in costumes and give each other "gang" names and then proceed to perform daredevil-like stunts which are not very impressive.   The book starts out talking about two of the teams failures - City Hall Place and the Croton Acqueduct, which makes you want to put it down and watch grass grow instead.  I've been past City Hall Station many times on the downtown 6 train, even with my Mother, it barely even qualifies as daredevil.  Their train stops while looping through the station and they are standing right there, but decide not to jump off - don't write a book about it then!!  Croton acqueduct is equally as sad - they walk through the tunnels for hours, then stop before the actual bridge (the goal) because they are tired - go back the next day and do it right, or don't write a book about it!!   Any yes, there are no pictures, although they refer to their pictures all the time.   The writing is pretentious and annoying and pointless for the most part - I want to read about "Exploring the Tunnels, Ruins, and Rooftops of Hidden New York" not about your evening spent in twin donuts looking like freaks and scaring people!!   Do yourself a favor and don't buy this book - there are better books about urban exploration, particularly ones about the NYC area.   
 This cookbook received rave reviews and is from a world reknown hospital.  Sounded great but what a disappointment!  A handfull of recipes, nothing new or exciting or even inspiring. I felt I wasted my time and money on this one and returned it.  I would have given it 0 stars if that was an option 
 My wife of ten years and me saw Brian on our first date in Providence RI he was amazing and holds a special place in my affections for that and other reasons, but this cd to me is a return to the lackluster ZZ Top/Sammy Hagar like songwriting of Nitro Burnin Funny Daddy. I totally understand wanting to stretch out of the rockabilly strait jacket some fans want to pin him in, but I think the man is more capable of the smart blues based americana rockabilly Springsteen and Dylan have explored than this stale arena rock like effort. Sorry, Brain I still love you man and will come out to your 2007 tour, just have to be honest that I really just can't dig this stuff 
 This book is not at all what it promises to be.  Very basic with poor indexing and little in-depth informatio 
 This is one of the few books where I can honestly say that the movie was better...  much better.  I was not impressed with Koontz's bad guy who was not very well developed at all.  The world is not so black and white, which makes things far more interesting 
 I've tried this razor for 5 weeks, both wet and dry and can only say that this is the worst electric razor that I've ever used. It doesn't give a close shave and requires a second shave with a standard razor to remove some of the stubble. I should have bought a new Norelco instead of this. My old Norelco always shaved me close. This Panasonic would still be handy as a travel razor, or to be used in a pinch. But for a close shaving everyday razor, this isn't the one to buy.  Oh well, I waited too long to send it back 
 the section on toddlers is written entirely from the female perspective assuming that the female actually cares and gets the child. I am a father and have custody and think that this book is garbage for all those dads out there that have their loved one 
 Sheer and utter.  This hardly can be called a work of fiction.  Had this been his first work, I could understand the grammatical mistakes, but this is inexcuseable.  The publisher should be fined for this book and the editor fired 
 If you're impressed with books by ageing wannabees desperately seeking reassurance through the challenging medium of bored, penniless prostitutes, you'll find this riveting. Otherwise you'll probably find it to be indulgent garbage.  I first went to Cuba in 1995 (being from Europe it was not a problem to travel there), around the time the Buena Vista Social Club was gaining worldwide recognition. It was a fascinating place. I stopped going about five years ago, as the place was becoming oppressive, full of miserable sex tourists and those same bored, penniless prostitutes who practically throw themselves at any foreigner who has a few dollars to offer (the average monthly wage in Cuba is about $10). It is also becoming more dangerous, due in part to the growing desperation and in part to the increase in drug activity. Inevitably, AIDS is becoming more widespread.  Baker seems at home amidst the seedier side of modern day Cuba. A quick look at the website makes it easier to understand why that might be. His gullibility, so apparent in the book, is perhaps less easy to comprehend. Don Juan, he clearly ain't. But he is supposed to be well traveled.  If what you are really interested in is a well-researched book on Cuba, believe me, there are much better ones than this. Don't be conned 
 Littel has written a book about undercover agents that assume identities and personalities, called "Legends". The premise behind the book, and this may be kind of vague because I read the book several months ago, is that one of these undercover agents (or former agents?) is seemingly struggling with a personality disorder that obscures his reality. Not only does the character seem to have issues with reality, but the reader is left guessing as to the certainty of many of the vingnettes that are loosly slapped together in this plodding, oftentimes aimless read.   The story is not very gripping or believable. There are flash-in-the-pan moments where the author paints a comical scene in what reminds me of the incredulous, but believable style of Tom Robbins. On the other hand, the book tries desperately to take on this Tom Clancy seriousness that is totally unbelievable in view of its outrageous episodes.   Perhaps I would have enjoyed  "Legends" had I read it more carefully. I read the book for pleasure and escape from a life of reading impossibly dull legal tomes. So mabye, had I approached the book with greater diligence and less expectations, it is possible that I would have enjoyed it. 
 I picked this up because I thought it was going to have some information about Ecuador (the Jaguar section) in it. It does--about one whole pages worth. The rest of the pages concern Gell-Mann's ideas on the inter-connectedness of things. Gell-Mann, for those of you who don't buy the Nobel prize-winning scientist collector cards, was the identifier of the Quark, that object that is smaller than what had previously been thought of as the smallest element (electrons are made up of a collection of quarks). This book is interesting but rough slogging at times as Gell-Mann tries to give you an instant understanding of the last ten years of modern physics. This should appeal to fans of Richard Feynman and Douglas Hofstadter, although the style isn't as smooth as either of them 
 Having read and absolutely adored the Black Jewels trilogy, I assumed this series would be more of the same, and was eager to get my hands on a copy. Little did I know how much of a disappointment was in store for me.  I was expecting the rich, dark fantasy/romance of her other books. What I got was a trite, cliched romance novel with bland characters I simply couldn't make myself care about in the slightest. There was nothing redeeming or interesting about any of the characters at all. Even the story wasn't good enough to keep me going--it read as nothing more than a cliched, Wiccan-oriented retelling of the so-called Burning Times. Yes, this could have been interesting were it done properly, but as it was...  Anne Bishop is not a terrible author, but this is a terrible series. I honestly cannot say I would recommend it to anyone. If you want a good read, pick up Daughter of the Blood or Sebastian. Don't waste your time with these 
 I am happy that the book has finally arrived after almost three months of its order in mid-December 2006. Otherwise no lament 
 As one reads the various customer reviews, it becomes obvious that the commentary in this book is skewed sharply to the right. Conservatives think it's "fair and balanced"; liberals don't. That's a tell tale sign as far as 24 TV news networks are concerned.  I have bought every edition since I turned 18 in 1978, but have decided not to purchase the next release after the 2006 election cycle. The hard factual information is accurate and well-presented. But the partisan slant compromises the book's credibility as an analytical product. With so much tendentious material, how can anyone not desirous of receiving the Fox News party line have  confidence in the soundness of the commentary--the "soft" factual information? Michael Barone made an excellent and original contribution to political political research when he introduced the Almanac back in the '70's. He now generates a product that's "in your face" if you're moderate or liberal. If you like George Bush, you'll love this book 
 I was actually looking forward to reading this book.  I came with an open mind and yet the poor writing and lack of credible arguments astounded me.  How is this author a scholar and still able to write weakly biased material that is published by a major house?  I would recomend not reading this book no matter what your stance is on these topics.  If you agree with the author, you may be blinded by your beliefs to embrace his scewed logic, and if you disagree, you will get a bad impression of the actual arguments his side could give 
   Just because some folks don't resemble human two-leggers and only have a hickory nut for a head doesn't mean they aren't real people all the same! Miss Hickory, a doll-like plaything belonging to Ann of the Old Place, maintains her dignity and self-respect during a long New Hampshire Winter. Shocked by the news that the Brown family has moved to Boston until late Spring, Miss Hickory relies on her woodland companions and her own ingenuity to survive without her corncob house.     The relations between Miss Hickory and Crow, Squirrel, Groundhog, a cat named Mr. T., Hen Pheasant and Robin provide light reading for children of a simpler era with its gentle pleasures and few dangers.  Underlying themes include the value of friendship and relaizing when not to be hardheaded.  Prim and resourceful Miss Hickory learns to recognize her own shortcomings and to trust to trust her friends, as she seeks to make a new life in the apple orchard.  This charming story offers literary safety in our modern age with its myriad threats to childhood innocence.  
 I borrowed this book from the library, as I have been very hesitant to spend the money on Cat Who books lately.  This one has set the seal on it, though...I don't even want to read them any more.  Even Koko and Yum Yum have been made totally uninteresting.  This is a series which should have retired on a positive note because so many people enjoyed it.  Instead, the publisher has run it into the ground through sheer incompetence.  I hope there is some poor lowly soul at Putnam whose job it is to read customer feedback and pass it on to the fools in charge...maybe they will finally let this series rest in piece 
 I'll tell you the truth - I purchased this film only so I could say I now own every movie Alan Rickman has ever done.  He, as any fan will tell you, brings vivid life to every character he does.  His portrayal of Ed the Artist is absolutely what I expected - well done, although the part was small.  Now, for the rest of the movie.  I have never witnessed overacting like this in my life -- not even on the high school stage.  The plot was thin and disjointed, (what do Virgo, prime numbers and Neil Sedaka all have in common?  Did I miss something?) and the scene where they finally catch the murderer is some of the worst acting I've seen.  I've given it two stars strictly because of Alan Rickman's involvement in the film and because I did stick it out until the end.  If you are a fan, rent this just to hear him say, "Don't molest anything-".. 
 Normally I will check the reviews on Amazon before I buy a book. Because I had read some of the very interesting but negative reviews of this book so I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it with my hard earned money. Thanks to those reviewers, I had saved twenty bucks.   Actually, this is a trading book of the interview type. The problems are: 1) The interviewees are far less famous than those in "Market Wizards I&II". 2) The author's fixation on "identify trends, cut losses, maximize profit and manage risk" (reflected by his questions like "Do you think X (any one of the above four)is important?" had limited the scope of answers from the interviewees that made the book much less useful and interesting than it could be. Very short "yes" and "no" answers from the respondents were frequent. 3) The author's deliberate separation of the book into the four main principles/chapters had made the whole book incohesive and hard to read. You can see the opinion of Jake Bernstein (a writer who wrote over 20 trading books) here and there that made you hard to have a holistic view of his trading strategy and ideology at all.   In short, just borrow one if you really want to read it 
 In my only other review of a Coben book('Gone For Good') I was concerned that he was relying too much on formulaic plots(guy loses girl, goes through hell, uncovers 'deep, dark, secret', and big plot twist at the end reveals all.) Unfortunately, every one of those characteristics is present in 'TNO', and the result is a terrible novel! It's not even good enough to be classed as a 'fun junk food' read. The plot is full of idiotic developments that are meant to be 'surprises', and ridiculously convoluted action/chase scenes. Yet another aspiring screenplay masquerading as a book. I won't even attempt to explain the plot. I suppose the only good thing I can say about the story is it didn't turn out to be another hokey 'serial killer' drama, after all...though that would have been an improvement! There are far too many cases of characters 'keeping secrets' and double-crossing each other...but the 'big secret' revealed at the end is the worst of all, destroying the slim chance that the reader might actually salvage something from this train-wreck.Plenty of other readers have already commented on the ridiculous supporting cast, which seems to be a Coben trademark, alongside his New York settings and poor plotting, so I'll skip them, and hope 'Hester' doesn't mind!  Read if you're a Coben fan, skip if you actually like stories that make sense and lead somewhere 
 This book is based on faulty research, with a small sample size and ancedotal stories of people the author grew up with in the 50's and 60's.  The issues these boys had in a small private school do not relate well to current gifted boys. As a teacher with a MS in Gifted Education I'm amazed that this book is so highly touted. Misinformation, as contained in this book, is more harmful than no information.  Read something else 
 This is like the muppets on acid. I think the average person would not enjoy this movie. I found it odd and did not enjoy it.   I am a fan of peter jackson and I did like dead alive.   The puppets are well done and the music is appropriate. Maybe this is much funnier if you are under the influence of something.. 
 The reason they stopped making albums because of Geri disappeared because this album was to tell Geri how they felt. The reason Geri quit because these 4 girls were making fun of Geri because she supported and loved Mariah Carey. I am a huge fan of Mariah Carey!!! I used to love their first and second albums and I never thought about buying their 3rd album because of Geri disappeared. I knew they wouldnt make 4th album and I was right!!! If they understood Geri and if Geri still working with them I am very sure they would make alot of albums by now. I sold my 1st and 2nd albums to a good friend of mine because I really didnt want to listen to these 4 girls singing after what they had done to Geri and talked real bad things about Mariah Carey 
 I read this novel the instant it came out.  Everyone was starving for more Star Wars.  Most of us mistakenly thought the sequel to the movie was going to be based on this book, but happily, it wasn't.  Its been many years since I read this book but I distinctly remember feeling it was all wrong.  The stakes in this story are very small.  HOWEVER, in spite of not liking the book, I still have it on my bookshelf twenty years later, because the cover art is AWESOME!  It was the coolest star wars illustration around at the time, and still is a classic.  there have been several covers for this novel, but the one I had featured a silhouette of Darth against a foggy forest, with Luke and Leia cowering in the foreground by a glowing red crystal.  Save yourself the money, and just do a google search and look at the cover.  Its very cool 
 "Slash & Thrust" by this same author was better -- even though there were a few minor errors, it contained a lot of useful information for the novice.  "Blade Master", however, was a disappointment.  Very few illustrations, longwinded and dull text, and the few illustrations provided were not easy to understand.  The author purports to go into various methods of cutting and thrusting in far more detail than his first book, but he sticks to the 6 basic moves from the first book and barely expands upon the concepts at all.  Sanchez provides details for constructing several simple training targets for cutting drills (basically, a strip of newspaper hanging from a string, a thread, and a tightly rolled newspaper), which may be useful for some.  His chapter on "Deviant Styles" briefly discusses how some people tend to attack with a knife, and weaknesses he has observed which may be exploited.  With a title like "Blade Master" I expected far more than this thin book provided. 
 Considering Groom's talents as a writer, I was disappointed in this book.  I got so bored with it that I practically had to make myself finish it.  The campaign itself is a very interesting one, but the book does not read that way.  That being said, the book does serve as a decent introduction to the Army of Tennessee and the campaign, but just is not in-depth or compelling enough for most buffs, I would think.  This book is useful as a start, but if you find yourself interested in the campaign after this book, move on to Wiley Sword's The Confederacy's Last Hurrah 
 I always wince a bit when Americans (and, really, most other nationalities) are all too confident when they poke fun at the French.  But sometimes the French play into the hands of such a characiture.  If one were in search of evidence that French films are obscure, despairing, and full of gratuitous sex dressed up as high art, Rendez-Vous should be exhibit A.  It is almost a parody of a crappy, pretentious, and completely joyless arthouse film.      Having escaped to Paris in order to "live life," Nina does quite the opposite.  The dingy depiction of the Paris underscores the impression that the city is more of a meat grinder than a place of discovery or liberation.  Early on in the film, we interupt Nina at the theater while as she is about to mount the usher.  He proceeds to treat her terribly, he insults her, and a pattern is born.  Nina will continue to attract and be drawn to men who abuse her.  Yet she is not simply a passive victim in this game.  Paulot, who arranged her lodging, seems at first to have the normal attraction to Nina.  Surely, this attraction is sexual, but it is not exclusively sexual.  We can easily imagine Paulot, if he had never been humiliated by her, desiring a normal relationship.  But as Nina later admits to her theater director, she would not sleep with Paulot.  He is sweet, and she tells Paulot that she loves him, but that is not enough.  She is drawn to something more sinister.  Paulot's behavior at the end of the film is disgusting and degrading, but I didn't feel that this was inherent to his character.  Nina has left her mark, Paulot becomes what he must be to have her.  Nina is not "living life" in Paris, she is emotionally dead, and is making the same of others.  Surrounding her relationships is a storyline concerning a production of Romeo and Juiliet, its director, and a tragedy involving its previous stars.  How this pertains to Nina is unclear, but the idea that "the sins (or tragedies rather) of the father will be visited on the son" comes to mind.   This film is not erotic, and Nina is not sexy.  We see no evidence of her desires and there is not one loving or tender second in this movie.  She runs head long into misery and sometimes can return it in kind.  Ulitmately, she is a little girl who is destroyed by Paris.  So what does the film want to portray?  Utter despair and humiliation?  How French!  I gave the movie 2 stars because I wasn't compelled to turn it off.  While I didn't like the movie, and won't recommend it, I was still kept reasonably interested, and do like watching Juiliette Binoche.  I hung on for some kind of redemtion, but it never came.  I guess that would be too sentimental, or bourgeios. It's a shame, because I do like many French movies, and movies that do something unusual.  
 Mr. Hershey has written some beautiful descriptions of the nature that surrounds him. He writes it over and over and over again. This is a tedoius little New Age book that can only be appreciated by those whose spiritually is grounded in "our Mother Earth". Everthing Mr. Hershey has to convey is said in the first chapter (possible in the foreward). Granted, we all need to stop and smell the roses, however Mr Hershey would have the reader fall face down in the roses and never get up. I did not like the rude language, and the quotes used lead me to beleive that Mr. Hershey as abandonded his Christian roots. I would not, will not recommend this book to my friends 
 Poorly written, boring - I got to about page 30 and gave up. Too many GOOD books, too little time. Someone PLEASE tell me how this boring piece of tripe got published 
 After reading the first four books in this series, I picked up this one, thinking that I would enjoy it just as much.  Oh, how I hate it when I'm wrong...  There was just nothing there to hold my interest.  It was.... well, boring!  I didn't care one bit about the characters or what happened to any of them.    Maybe it got better toward the end, but I can't say for sure.  I think I was about 100 - 130 pages into it and just trying to force myself through.  So - I decided to stop.    Sorry Piers 
 I bought 3 of these to monitor my invalid mom and they don't work well. The manual is not thorough, but it does tell you AFTER you bought the product that there is a one-second delay unless you buy an AC adapter.  I just bought 12 batteries for 3 units and wasn't about to buy an AC adapter to see IF that fixed it. It cut off my mom's voice and I rarely heard her message. The units also have annoying beeps that can't be turned off. No real volume control either. A very overpriced and poorly designed unit. Also, the switches to adjust for conference and vox mode are small and need a small object smaller than a pen to change them. The sound is clear if it doesn't cut you off, but the units are far from user-friendly. 
 Failing this class need the book to define words that are not in other dictionary's book was ordered January 20, 2006......still waiting 
 Although Ellison's The Solitary Druid may contain many basic facts about druids and modern druidic practice, the way in which he organizes and presents this material makes this book practically useless. The most comprehensive, coherent and helpful chapters of this book deal with his discussion of the eight yearly holidays, in which he provides Celtic myths and deities appropriate to the more traditionally Wiccan themes already well established for each celebration. In these two chapters he also presents a general outline for ritual structure (which, yes, is markedly different from Wiccan rituals); unfortunately, a reader must wade through a large amount of repetition before getting a feel for the practices themselves.  The first several chapters of this book are highly disorganized, often attempting to clarify one idea by referring casually and haphazardly to other ideas or activities that have not even been discussed yet, only adding to the reader's sense of confusion. (There are also a glaring number of typos and grammatical/syntactical mistakes in the writing itself.)  Considering Ellison's own emphasis on the scholarship and creative artistry of the druid path, this book shows very little of either. It's scholarly work is bumbling at best, merely citing out-of-context references and "facts" from various sources in repetitive list form without making any attempt to draw general conclusions or theories of relevance. For example, his use of citations to support modern sexual practices (many of which are, even out of context, clearly accusing the Celtic culture of barbarism in the form of child-abuse and rape) belies a very shallow understanding of analytical scholarship and historical research.  If you are looking for insight into the history of the druids, this book is beyond worthless. If you are interested in pursuing druidism as a spiritual practice, there are many sources available which present the same material in a much more comprehensive and practical way. With the exception of the chapters on holiday ritual and the final chapter listing various druid networks and resources, this book is not worth the price. Ellison may be a good group leader and in-person teacher, but he is clearly neither a scholar nor a writer 
 i think it is really bad and not teaching the children good things about the octupuss 
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
 I think this book fails to supply the most important information to those with fibromyalgia. It makes the dissorder seem so mysterious, when it is not. Much is known about FM that this book skims over or doesn't mention. Sleep is the major component to FM, because of a deficiency of serotonin, preventing us from getting delta sleep, the restorative sleep that revitalizes energy, and heals/relaxes muscles. Check out "Fibromyalgia" by Daniel J. Wallace. That does a much better job 
 I've been in the direct marketing business for 13 years and I was looking for this book to at least match what I knew.  I was very disappointed and felt that I was ripped off.  This woman didn't know what she was talking about.  The book is written in a non-user friendly fashion, almost like a college textbook.  Half the time I didn't even know what she was talking about, and I've been in the business for quite awhile.  She doesn't give examples of copy or anything else that could have been useful to exemplify a direct response test.  Here's the deal:  If you are serious about making money in mail order or direct response, don't get any of these waste-of-time books that "claim" to show you the business.  The ONLY book that I've ever read that can (almost) exactly mirror exactly what I do for my $7-million per year business is a book by Vincent James called The 12-Month Millionaire which you can get on eBay (or type in on a search engine) since it's not a regular published book.  The only thing I wouldn't follow in that book is the low priced items he recommends selling like wrinkle creams and weight loss pills (stick with information courses of $199+ with mail order as a RULE, ALWAYS).  Lower end products of $99 or less will cause you to lose money in mail order EVERY TIME!!  Good luck 
 I met Ian Moore during one his shows in 1990. He was not very happy when I told him that his guitar playing was similar to Stevie Ray Vaughan. I was just giving him a very genuine compliment. At that time Ian had not released any CD yet.  I have later bought every CD Ian Moore released hoping to hear this great sound Ian delivered on his Fender during his past shows, and every time I was deceived.  I believe That Ian was fed up hearing fans comparing his music to SRV, and  probably decided to shift to a compete different style. Making rock songs and not emphasizing on his Guitar playing. In my humble opinion, Ian Failed royally in that sense.    The result is weak tracks, falling short in delivering melodically complete songs; even the guitar playing is very basic and does not show the real talent of this great guitar player.   This CD and like "Modernday Folklore"  deserves no more than 2 stars, however after attending many concerts for Ian Moore, I say Ian has lots of potentials and can easily deliver 5 stars CDs; he just needs to work with musicians that can write good songs and can show what Ian can do on this Fender. I hope he will use his talents the right way.  
 When I realized early on the time I would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept, I resolved that I would alert other readers.   Generally I enjoy this author's works and anticipated this latest tome. I was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it's clues or probable developments. Everything was telegraphed and nothing was original. The conclusion was so lame that I was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue.  My advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next 
 This just to voice my opinion on the new RAN transfer. While I agree it is an improvement over the atrocious Fox Lorber edition (which is not that great an achievement considering the Fox Lorber DVD was one of the worst products in the history of home entertainment), this tranfer is still a long way from doing this masterpiece justice. Yes, the colors are vivid but the sharpness and definition are exceptionally poor and the heavy edge enhancement (straight from hell!) doesn't make it any better. I have seen transfers of movies that are some 30 or 40 years older than RAN but look far better. The problem becomes very obvious when one watches this DVD via progressive component output on a large screen - a video tape was used as a master (and a poor one at that). The only way to restore such an important movie properly and thereby finally showing Mr. Kurosawa the respect he deserves would have been to make a direct digital transfer off an original film negative, before applying filters or any enhancements. Why this opportunity was (again) wasted here escapes me totally and angers me very much. Another problem seems to be the excessive use of noise reduction on the video, which is in part responsible for the poor definition of the transfer. For my part, I would much sooner live with a bit of visible film grain and the odd dust speckle than to have a such a "saucy" soft picture without much "bite" and detail. There is no excuse for posting such an objectively false statement. And yes, the packaging is a liability - my DVDs must have been bobbing about in there all the way across the Atlantic and looked accordingly. Shocking. I would have gladly payed twice the price if they had kept all the cards and posters and instead got the most important thing right: the image quality of RAN. Like this, I'm very disappointed 
 I thought this book is drivel.  Itis nothing more than a series of badly written, rambling articles written in the breathlessly enthusiastic style that is typical of body building mags.  It does contain some suggestions for interesting excercises and tips on how to make equipment, but you can find all that for free by doing a Google on "grip strenth training"  There is not one diagram or word of explanation for the muscles in the hand and forearm and what movements they control.  Not one!  Other than suggesting ideas for the exercises themselves, there is no real discussion about an actual exercise program.  Should one do 5 reps or 50 reps? Is it best to exercise every day?  Twice a week?  The book is no help.  If you cant get enough of the magazine article and you want to read a bunch of badly written accounts of who squoze what and when then this book is for you - otherwise save your $ 
 Despite my low rating, I found this book to be very interesting and an important statement on the dual-identity that exists among Jewish-Americans.  This book could also serve as an important resource to anyone who holds an interest in the changing social definitions of race & class during late 19th century/20th century America, and how the Jewish community fared amongst those changes.  Dr. Brodkin did an excellent job at finding published examples to show this changing opinion of Jews.  She also made a wise choice in choosing to zero in on one of the main factors of American mobility which is family economics.  In this aspect, this book should find it's way to any reading list pertaining to Jewish-American social/class identity studies.  On the other hand, I am disappointed in the writing style and tone of this book;  although she did seem to "warn" the reader of this beforehand in the Acknowledgments section when she admitted that when she began her research, she did not intend to write specifically about Jewishness.  That statement sort of set the stage for a pretty incoherent collection of information that is loosely worked into the book's intended purpose.  For example, in Chapter 1., she devotes pages to statistics and descriptions of racist policies the FHA used to keep Black people out of suburbia.  Although this information is interesting, how does it relate to Jewish people?  In a much smaller span, Dr. Brodkin could have demonstrated the FHA's discrimination and then move on to how that affected Jewish migration into suburbia.  She does a similar thing again in when she goes into detail about inequality in skilled labor in reference to Mexicans and Black people.  Again, interesting, but there is too much information about a subject the book is not supposed to address.  I understand that her point is to give the reader some background on how your racial identification affected your employment, but when your working text is only around 150 pp., it just detracts from the overall theme of the book.  I was also surprised at how Dr. Brodkin choose to sporadically intersperse her own experiences and family history into a book that had so much scholarly research.  If she would have chosen to present the personal aspects of the topic in a more organized way (perhaps in separate chapters), it would have been much more natural to read.  Also, I got the feeling that she was over-romanticizing and referencing the African-American experience simply because she herself had a history of civil-rights activism and admiration for Black culture.  Again, although I find this very interesting, it only detracts from what you are trying to find out from this book...and that's the Jewish-American experience, not the African-American experience and how it either parallels or identifies with the African-American experience.  This book is far from being a masterpiece or required reading.  However, the topic is interesting and I only hope that others will be willing to tackle this issue of "White-privilege", perceived & real, within the Jewish community with more seriousness and depth 
 I've read through the reviews of this, and it's rather dissapointing. I have personally only seen a video clip of this DVD, so I can't really review the product. However, all this stuff about overdubbing, and how it's bad, it's really annoying. First off, like people say it happens almost everywhere, so it isn't a real suprise. Nor is it a new thing, the KISS Alive record had a lot of overdubs in it, but it sold a lot!! So, i don't really see what the problem is... it's a dvd, so it's going to be edited for best quality!! Deal with it, if you don't like the dvd, go see them live and find out for real!! Stop your whinning!! 
 I disliked this book enough to take time to say so. The style of writing is difficult, circuitous, repetitive, and wordy. It is full of generalizations and citations from other authors and is lopsided in its  thesis that all good things come from hunter/gatherers. It is nostalgic  babble about a time long gone, from which we continue to evolve. There is  no going back. No pragmatic solutions are offered for improving our present  day predicaments, such as over population, aggressive behavior and  overcrowding. This book seems to me to be an academic treatise with  sophomoric overtones, trying to sound more profound than it really is. In  all fairness some of the problem may be that the book is a posthumous  publication 
   I'm a real lover of Ricky Skaggs music, but this is by far the poorest put together CD in my collection. I guess I was after somemore good bluegrass. If you think you want to buy it listen to all the songs first. Take my advise pass this one up 
 The use of the word "superstition" in the title is a mistake, and one that captures the problem with the whole argument.  The book is meant as a rebuttal to E.O. Wilson's book Consilience, which argues for an expansion of the use of the scientific method into the realm of the Humanities.  A superstition is a belief that one holds without any supporting evidence or in spite of evidence to the contrary.  Some examples would include believing that bad things are more likely to happen on Friday the 13th, that the Earth is 6000 years old, or that water can be located with a bent twig.  The human mind is so susceptible to superstition that people had to devise a method of constantly checking their beliefs against observations.  That's science -- the thing that rescues you from superstition.  I have to believe that anyone who thought seriously about the scientific method would be OK with it.  After all it's just away of keeping oneself honest.  In this book Wendell Berry seems particularly angry about something called "scientism," a silly word meant to criticize those who place undue faith in the scientific method.  Berry's argument is that there are aspects of human existence that are outside the realm of science, and to think otherwise is to engage in superstition.  But he's wrong.  Science is a tool for figuring out how things work, and people use it because it has time and again proven successful in solving mysteries that seemed impenetrable, even deeply spiritual.  In other words people use science to solve problems because centuries of evidence have shown it to be the best way to solve problems.  One might as well use the word "carpentism" to describe the belief that patios can be made out of wood and nails.  Beyond carping about what can be studied, Berry really wants to limit the things that should be studied.  I have to say I find this kind of creepy.  He talks a lot about his sense of wonder at the beauty of his Kentucky farm, but what about people who derive a sense of wonder from the mathematical structure of music or the brain circuitry that gives rise to religious experience?  I can think of no objective reason why farms are more beautiful than equations, or poetry more beautiful than synapses.  And suppose our knowledge of synapses could improve people's lives.  Suppose we could use a rigorous understanding of the biological basis of thoughts and emotions to treat schizophrenia (one of the world's leading causes of human misery).  I know of no other way to investigate the way the brain works, and no reason why such suffering is not worth alleviating.  The book also complains a great deal about the abuses of science by politicians and corporations.  As several other reviewers have pointed out, his legitimate beef here is with the government, not science.  Governments were abusing their subjects long before there was any such thing as science, and they will continue to do so as long as their corruption is unchecked.  The U.S. is (for the moment) a democracy that is responsive to the will of the people, and the laws regulating industry can be changed far more easily than the laws of physics 
  I first heard about this book in a graduate level Latin American survey course.  I kept it in the back of my mind and finally got around to reading it years later.  The professor had described it glowingly and subsequent references to it that I came across were all very positive.  Consequently I really looked forward to reading this book.  I was extremely disappointed.  Published in 1938 I would say that overall the book has aged badly.  It is overly dramatic, even emotionally silly in parts. The plot is insipid.  The Mexican characters are not Mexican but European with a little Mexican airbrushing.  The indigenous people are portrayed as one-dimensional simians.    I read that prior to writing the book Graham Greene spent a total of eight weeks in Mexico.  It sadly shows.   He has little understanding of Mexico.  I can't understand the continuing hoopla surrounding this work.  If you want to read some decent fiction about early twentieth century Mexico try something by B. Traven. 
 I'll start by saying that I have found reception to worse than the $20 clock radio it replaced.  For it's small footprint, the sound is nicer than one would expect to come out of a small radio.  However, in no way is it as nice as a small set of decent bookshelf speakers.  It just can't produce the accurate highs that come from a seperate tweeter, nor can it produce low end frequencies with any real presence (I am NOT referring to boomy bass here).  Overall, the sound is a bit tinny.  It would make a great clock radio if they improved the reception, and it was 1/4 the price.  That'll never happen, though, because too many people have fallen for the gimmicky Bose sound. 
 It would seem that this book has not been updated in some time since The Blue Man Group hasn't been performing at Luxor for over a year 
 if you read any of my other reviews you will hear my go on and on about the misfits and what an influence they had/have on me.  so why only the one star?  because if youll notice the track list, it is simply the last 7 songs on the collection 1 album and the last 5 on the collection 2...so you may already own this and not even know it.  and guess what?  THEY SOUND EXACTLY ALIKE!!  its not like its different versions or anything its the same...for a band to take half of two cds and combine them and sell it as a different album is a disgrace.  the only complaint i have about this terrific band.  
 The authors attempted to show how scholarly they are by using very hard to understand language.  I would have appreciated language that was easier to understand to help me deduce their perspectiv 
 For decades feminist authors such as Miss Daly have used their dubious credentials in academia to promulgate the fantasy of a golden age before the onset of "patriarchy," It's the same 60s nonsense clothed in a new phraseology and when we strip away the fancy prose we're left with the following executive summary: Women once ruled the earth with flowy robes and Gaia conjuring magic wands, and all the world worshipped the Goddess. Any woman who has the courage to study the historical, archeological and paleological evidence by academics with ACTUAL ACCREDITED Ph.D.s will soon understand that this gynocentric vision is a myth which harms and enslaves women. Why? The effect of this genre of novel is not to increase grace, love and mercy, but to further splinter humanity into yet more little tribes, all petulantly vying for victim-status and privilege. When we sublimate and externalize our spiritual pain and longing for transcendence to a hatred of other groups (in this case, men) how can we find happiness in our journey through life?  The best antidote to Miss Daly's agenda-of-rage is Cynthia Eller's "The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory : Why An Invented Past Will Not Give Women a Future." Cynthia Eller easily exposes the Gaia/Sophia/Lilith scam. Reading this can help the reader differentiate between the two major taxonomies of Truth: the external, objective and verifiable reality which increases our understanding of the world, vs. collecting subjective emotional concepts to serve as a "stabilizing glue" for one's fragmented  consciousness. Another valuable read is "Interior Castle" or "The Way of Perfection" by St. Teresa of Avila. I challenge any woman to read those 2 books and conclude that this woman was "marginalized" and repressed by the "patriarchy." More likely, they would understand that a loving apprehension of woman's beauty, power and regnancy existed centuries before the word "feminism" was ever breathed on a western campus. The great irony is that this vision of women, infinitely larger, more beautiful and complex than anything modern feminism has ever proposed, is the very reality which Miss Daly desperately wishes to extinguish in her disciples. In 50 years, the present farrago of theoreticians- Andrea Dworkin, Germaine Greer, Naomi Wolf, Susan Faludi ad infinitum will all be dead and forgotten, their books mouldering in bargain bins and used book stores. Each began with a half-truth: yes, our modern secular society is indeed repressive to women, but each fell into error by conjecturing that secular humanism was the implacable norm in society and represents God's plan for humanity. It is not. Feminist authors are themselves caught in the engrenage of materialism which afflicts our society, and thus, their solutions to free women can't work. In the guise of freedom, they end by merely exalting themselves and leading women further away from the truth. Don't follow their fate, sisters... only love is stronger than death, prejudice and violence. Open your heart and you will receive the graces to understand that there is but one division in life, that between creature and creator. When that day comes, you'll be forever immune to the hate of Miss Daly and her friends. God was beside you all along, a thousand times more ready to give than you were to ask 
 I have loved many of Jodi Picoult's other books, but this one seemed too far-fetched. I did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it.  Many of my friends who are Jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release 
 This is one of the worst Official strategy guides you could ever buy.  Sure it covers all of the missions, but some of them are not covered any more fully than what you get from playing the game itself.  It briefly covers SOME of the side jobs and non-mission tasks, but an Official guide should cover ALL of them!  There is no detailed information on the Rampages and Unique Jumps, and the Hidden Packages are only covered with a map and short sentence.  Some of the other reviewers here go into detail about the deficiencies of this book, so I really don't need to say much more.  DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE GOOD REVIEWS THIS BOOK RECEIVED, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DESERVE THEM.  I own this guide and the one released eight months later for the PC version.  Although the PC guide is smaller (but much thicker) and in black & white (there are color maps in the back), it covers EVERYTHING (except cheat codes) about the game and with much more detail.  Even if you own the Playstation 2 version of the game, you'd be better off buying the PC guide.  The only difference gameplay wise are the controls mentioned in the book and a few little things like rewards for some of the vehicle missions.  To wrap this up, here is an excerpt from the author in the Acknowledgement's section of the PC guide: "Beyond the satisfaction of playing the game a few more times, I was even more delighted to add features to this guide that I didn't have time to include in the PS2 guide.  And with Tim Cox's phenomenal assistance, as well as his passion for the game, time was no longer the enemy.  We are proud to bring you the most comprehensive Grand Theft Auto III guide in existence."  So, that explains why this guide (PS2) sucks.  The author was rushed to complete the book, in time for the release of the game, no doubt.  Right there in black & white the author of both guides tells you that the PC guide is the most comprehensive guide, and thus the best one. (I have no idea if the X-Box Double Pack guide is based on the PS2 or PC versions, so proceed with caution when getting that one. 
 John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. I love Of Mice And Men, East of Eden, and The Grapes Of Wrath. But this 4-part story of a a boy and a horse (which isn't even about the horse that much) is pointless drivel. I'll admit, I liked the first part of it, which is great and good enough to warrant two stars. The rest of it feels disjointed. I couldn't wait to get done with it.  It isn't a terrible book, but it isn't good at all. It's below average, and below average is not what I expect from the writer of Of Mice And Men 
 I just bought this CD and it was the worst CD ever put out by Adam Sandler. I am a real fan of Adam Sandler but this was pathetic. I figured out why the title is call Shhh...Don't tell, it's because Shhh...Don't tell anyone that this is a piece of crap so others will buy it. I am sorry Adam but I know you can do better than this 
 I bought this rhyming dictionary from Amazon noting that it was cheap and thinking most of them would be the same.  In general, it has served me well, but while looking up a rhyme in the "er" family (rhymes with "air"), I noticed that the book didn't have "care."  It had "air" and "dare" and a ton of other words, but it didn't have "care."  This might seem like a minor point, but I have to wonder, What other words are missing?  If you want a resource like this, you want it to be comprehensive.  Sure, I knew "care" myself, but what other wonderful rhymes aren't included in this book?  I can't be certain.  As I've said, it's generally served me well, but this whole "care" thing has bothered me and sent me looking for a better rhyming resource.  I've tried the Clement Wood book, and it seems thorough.  However, I don't like its division into syllables 
 The recipes included are good, but this is not a "cooking" magazine. This is a women's fitness magazine in disguise. While I am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness, it shouldn't advertise itself as a cooking magazine. There is way too much other junk. If I wanted a makeover or an exercise routine, I don't expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that. 
 This book is vaguley geared to thoose with disabilites. I would find this useful if I was in a wheel chair or had another obstacle. However having a pain disorder the book read to me of that of "NORMAL" healthy people. Wasted my limited money. 
 With the great business that has been flourishing to serve curiosity for Islam (read: hate for Islam) after 9/11 - this author joins the gold rush. Not only that he couldn't confirm with any evidence of document or other to Al-ahram newspaper that he has been affiliate of Alazhar universitie and earned a degree in Islamic studies there. But the book has many fallacies that can never be the outcomes of a person who studied Islam. I aticipate that the book will follow the destiny  of Norma khouri's book "Forbidden Love, A Harrowing True Story of Love and Revenge in Jordan ". The ethnic aspirations of the author are clear in his tone when speaking about the injustices that are done to his people - the Copts 
 I had this book for a curriculum and instruction class and I could not stay awake for more than two pages.  The chapters are extremely long and often repeat the same information 
 Although there are a lot of recipes in this book, they all taste very similar and none are really great. Also, the editor did a terrible job in that there are ambiguities between the ingredients list and the instructions. I would NOT recomend this book to anyone who appreciates a truly great muffin 
 We've always used Mr Coffee coffeemakers. A friend raved about this Bunn model...really fast coffee with great taste... so much so she sent one to us as a birthday gift.  Well, its great if you dont care about auto shut-off (I DO!) and if you dont care about spilling the coffee when you sneak a cup before the entire brew cycle is finished, the good ol' pause and serve feature (I DO..) and if you could care less about programming your next pot (I DO). Granted, it does brew quickly. But it just doesnt have the features that I want and use, therefore it rates a 1 out of 5 
 If you are a Blackmore fan stay away from this piece of crap because during the guitar solos all you will see is Gillan shaking his butt or "playing" the congas and everybody else except, of course, the guitar work. I couldn't bear it anymore in the middle of Child in Time and will certainly not check the rest of this mess. On another level, I am just appaled by the extremely poor musicianship of Jon Lord! This guy just Stinks so bad that even I could take him on the Hammond; I'm a guitarist by trade. Heck, even Blackmore is very ordinary from what I've se...heard. Can't say anything about Glover because you can't hear what he's playing. So the only high points of this video, as far as I could stand it, is Ian Paice's performance which is excellent as usual and Gillan's incredible voice. A very sad thing because DP was my favorite band and one of the major reasons I took up the guitar in '69. I can certainly live with the bad sound and picture considering the time that the show took place but absolutely not the crappy playing. This one is NO keeper and I simply threw it away, but if you really want to see DP at it's best go for the Concerto For Group and Orchestra DVD, with the Royal Symphony Orchestra, but there again you won't see much of Blackmore's work but the musicianship is way better 
 Neruda is great, no doubt about it. He even shines through in places here, despite these clunky and artless translations of his beautiful poems. If you really want to read a translation which retains Neruda's passion, try W.S. Merwin . Being a fine poet in his own right he has a light hand and a feel for words that is true to the spirit of Neruda's writings 
 This book presents some fascinating ideas, but lousy arguments.  Kohanov argues that horses have a healing ability because of their special ability to see auras, communicated across distances, and similar reasons.  I was extremely annoyed by such reasoning.  Auras have no reliable, emperical data that I have been made aware of (if such evidence exists, please show me)  The idea of morphic fields strikes me as silly, once again, no data!  However, on the up side, the idea that horses are valuable as therapuetic tools, I agree with, but the argument can be made substantially stronger 
 At the start of this year I pledged not to buy any CDs for six months and it took some willpower on my part to pull this off.  When I saw this book I was happy because here I expected to find a "how-to" book written by someone that pledged not to buy anything that was not essential.  Mistake. The book doesn't have all that much to offer by way of how to cut down on purchases of nonessentials except that they offer many examples of mooching off of their friends. While reading the book you need to realise that the author's rambling's are often just plain factually incorrect.  On page 259 the author says "Europeans can choose not to work as much because they don't have to pay for a great deal of what we pay for.  The welfare state pays for..."  The author seems to think that the Man in the Moon pays for these things, i.e., some distant third party does the paying.  Not so, these things still have to be paid for.  An economy can only consume as much as it produces (in the long run).  In the book you have to be constantly vigilant to separate the rambling's from the facts. The book is a personal diary of 2004 but the author is careful not to make it too personal.  I wouldn't mind reading someone's diary for a year if they included everything.  The author talks at length about the radio tower in Hardwick and the Republican convention but the book is very sparse on her relationship with her partner.  That part of her private life stays private.  So does much else.  You're given some insight into her relationship with friends but nothing about family. I took the book out from a library.  I'd suggest that other readers do the same 
 I love Italian exploitation, but this movie forgets to throw in the exploitation.  The worst Italian horror flick of all time?  Maybe, but then what about Evil Clutch.. 
 seems like this video could be useful, but the trainer is terrible at working the camera and makes you feel uncomfortable watching it, yet alone trying to work out to it....some of the moves were cool, but all in all i will trade this in for something else 
 I bought this book because of a recommendation.  I viewed some of it at Amazon and it seemed to be a book that would be of value, but, alas, a total waste.  The author has an apparent agenda and his own biased attitudes though he claims not to.  I have no objections to his view that to be healed we need to turn things over to Jesus, but the way he goes about presenting issues leaves me angry and frustrated.  The author and I were born in the same year and experienced many of the changes our society has undergone during that time. (Nee 1944) I feel he would be more comfortable if we could all go back to the 1950s when men were men and went off to war and did the manly thing by their families, etc.  If only men were the men they used to be.  Men need to get into boots and levi's and their trucks and be real men again, though with the proper Christian spirit. The very name of the book is strange.  I didn't think a soul had a gender!  It would have been better to have been entitled something like "Healing the Male's Self-Image" or "Discovering the Real Male in You"  But whatever title he gave it it would have left me feeling the same.  He is too full of stereotypical images and impoverishes the reader because of it.  He judges all by the men he has personally encountered. I would rather give this book a zero star rating but Amazon did not give me that choice. It doesn't deserve a one star rating 
 I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read.  There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school.  Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it 
 I'm a graduate student at Stanford University and was required to purchase and read this book in conjunction with a sociology class I'm taking. I have to say that I am PROFOUNDLY upset that I was forced to purchase this book and add to this author's royalties. It was incredibly hard to read through his essays, much of which kept repeating the same Greek tragedies of war which the author so loves to cite. I found his language pompous, bombastic, and downright racist when it came to discussing and lumping the entire "Islamic world" into a tidy ball of hatred and anti-Westernism. His privileging of Western forms of war was baffling to me--a sort of strange thing to keep pounding on in light that wars in general can be tragic. As an American I am embarrassed that books like these can circulate and find a wide audience. I wasted my time reading this book and found myself enraged at the author's lack of reflection on more global issues regarding cultures and civilizations. His premise is that the West is superior in all ways, and there is no question that everyone else is just jealous. Again, I can't state how angry I am that I have contributed to this man's coffers, be it ever in so small a way! This book is not well-balanced enough to offer a view of 9-11 and the U.S. reactions to it. If you are of the view that the U.S. should just bomb the hell out of anyone who crosses its path--total anihilation and humiliation--then by all means, read this book. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and do some thinking of your own 
 i hate to sh*t on underground rap but funcrusher plus is the only good thing el ps ever done. his flow isnt catchy, i cant understand him, his beats are non melodic. someone will say im too dumb to appreciate him. whatever. there are plenty better mcs in the underground than this:mf doom, murs, c rayz walz, dilated, beatnuts, non phixion, necro and pretty much everyone makes better music than ginger boy. hes a geek with a ginger mustache and he sips ammoni 
 I don't know what is happening with authors these days, but with each book they seem to get worse and Catherine Coulter is following trend. Ms. Coulter's early works such as "The Legacy Trilogy", "The Magic Trilogy" were really good, but "Pengragon"  was very bad. I didn't realy care about the either of the main characters and the only reason that read the book was the fact that I spent over eight dollars for it. Maybe Ms. Coulter and others should take a break and take the time to write a book that is worth its money 
 I was sadly disappointed to find I did not like this book at all after all the glowing reviews it received here.  The characters were flat and the author gave me no reason to care about any of them.  Everything was very 2 dimensional for me.  I bought the book as a gift based on the reviews here, then a copy for myself so I could get in on the fun.  I forced myself through half the book before I just tossed it and promised my father a replacement - something I'd read already and knew he would enjoy.  But that's just my opinion - obviously not shared by many 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 Grandma would love the rooms in this book. I'll be sure to get her a copy for the holidays. For the rest of us, this book is filled with one super-boring room after another. Zzzzzzzzzzz....... 
 This is a helpful book in ways, great at pointing out some of the coaching tips that are useful, BUT, she states that you do not necessarily need to have a qualification to be a coach - this is so wrong - people who do not know what they are doing can do damage in coaching as in any field.  It is these kind of people that give qualified coaches a bad name - I think it is such an irresponsible statement to make 
 This boot looked so much better online. For this boot to be by Nine West it looked very cheap. I was very disappointed with this product that I returned it but I'm still waiting for my refund!! 
 I ordered this book for my son because I thought it would be a cute and entertaining story.  I was extremely disappointed to find out that it was neither cute nor entertaining.  The plot and characters are very shallow and simplistic, although that is not the problem I have with this book.  The problem is the writing style.  It is written in a very colloquial style and has no literary flair whatsoever.  If you are looking for a sweet, funny undersea story to read your young one, look elsewhere.  This one lacks quality and refinement 
 I've read a couple other books by Bill's books and always loved them.  Great characters, great story line, involved and wonderful.  This book was missing all of that - and then some.  The main characters are SO uninteresting that I had a hard time continuing to read.  I could have cared less if the old billionaire lived or died.  Does the married eco-freak couple actually keep the baby ... WHO CARES.    The story revolves around organ transplants, the drive of an old wealthy man to procreate and cure himself, a couple fighting for the rights of the environment, a third world organ thief of a doctor, and a crazy orphan who sells himself for a living.  Yes it has promise.  No - the story line does not deliver.  Please don't buy this book.  You'll only be disappointed 
 The photo on Amazon isn't representative of the product I received.  The frame is white, or an extremely light silver.  I also bought a LaCrosse Technology WT-3122A 12-Inch Wood Atomic Analog Clock, which didn't match it's photo either, but at least I like it.  
 the TRUTH. This is the third book of Ms. Meades I have read and again stockpiled with errors. She tried to be scandalous, but comes of as a gossip. There is only one word of advice I have for Ms. Meade: RESEARCH.  I know you'll have to look that one up 
 First off i just want to say that i've read "The Secret of the Old Clock" and it made this game even more boring because i knew the basic outline.  I see in an above review an adult of the age 35 loved it, which i can understand. But I'm 15 and i found this game OVERLY boring. The puzzles were way too easy, and driving around in the horribly done car part of the game made me want to quit playing. It says youll get a pay if you do some chores for people...i didnt get anything. Although I love herinteractive and and i love all the other nancy drew games i would highly reccomend you dont waste $19.00 on it. I would only reccomend getting it if it was in a value pack of Nancy Drew games 
 I think the theory is flawed.  A giant goat with a big magnet is responsible for gravity.  That's until the goats keeper takes it away for milking and then there's no gravity 
 I bought this item because of a great price, Amazon shipped it regualr UPS and I received it earlier that expected, the box looked in good shape but when I opened it one of the legs was broken off,I thought at first that it must have taken a pretty good hit to do that, so I called customer service and they sent me a return tag and shipped me a new one right out, I got it, opened it and the exact same thing, box was in good shape but 1 leg was broken, I called customer service and again they shipped another one out, this time second day air. I get the third one and guess what, the exact same thing for the third time! I looked at it carefully and each time it was broken at the weld in two areas on the cooker and it had to have been poor workmanship and quality control, it even looked like it had rusted in one weld! I can't say enough about Amazon's customer service,but I wouldn't reccommend buying the banjo cooker by mail order 
 This was a wishy washy attempt at the truth. The facts are there in parts and pieces, but it was not really put together well. Some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic. This DVD had an agenda and is not unbiased, and I think it failed at it's overall agenda. There is more than enough information pre-9/11 and post-9/11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this DVD has attempted to do. If this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond, we are truly in trouble. The truth is out there, and I think this DVD tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together. There were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this DVD, but this DVD is maybe worth a glance, but not a long hard look. 
 Kozol spews his normal emotional stuff but fails to get to the underlying problem: government-provided goods always have at least 2 out of 3 features: they cost a lot, they are low in quality, and they harm the poor. Government education wins the Trifecta: it does all three.  If someone said that lower income people who get food stamps should have to spend their food stamps in government run supermarkets, we would see the idiocy: government has no edge in producing or distributing food. Well, now we have government giving education stamps but saying they have to be spent in government run education stores. Kozol has no right to be shocked. 
 This book has a shocking, last minute twist a la Sixth Sense.  The surprise in the movie, Sixth Sense, however, works.  Your view of the story is suddenly turned on its head and you're left wanting to go back to look for the clues that you missed before.  In the case of this book, the twist was completely unbelievable and even felt a bit obscene.  To make it every more frustrating, I thought the book was  actually a good read, and I kept reading thinking the mystery's solution would be revealed and the intriguing  questions would somehow be tied up. Instead, the ending left me rolling my eyes and feeling duped rather than entertained. This Beach Road leads to nowhere 
 I ordered this book in a moment of inattention thinking it was something by the US Army Historical Section. It's certainly an impressive book in physical terms, weighing in at 5.8 kgs. (12.8 lbs). It is also lavishly illustrated, but to call it a "complete history" is overstating the case. It is a chronological overview of the high points (the low points are carefully skipped - don't expect to find Mi Lay in the index) of US military history with a heavy emphasis on the heroic and red, white and blue patriotic sentiment. The preface states something like "Our soldiers are moral warriors who defend unchanging values etc. etc." If you're a patriotic American and want to present a handsome gift to your local high school library, a gift that, who knows, may inspire some youngster to embrace the profession of arms, this book seems like an excellent idea. But if you're looking for 50 dollars' worth of serious military history, I would advise you to look elsewhere.  
 I was so angry that I wasted time reading this spectacularly boring book that I had to warn others.  The storyline is repetitious as is the diction...I have to agree with the author of review that asked if DS even has an editor anymore.  Sheesh... 
 Normally I don't review content on DVDs just execution ....this product suffers on both counts.  The true story of BABE RUTH is a legendary one...and this movie pays little attention to much of it.  With all the amazing athletic feats to deal with this movie mostly takes the personal route and gets pretty redundant with it...how many belches do we need to hear or meals do we need to see consumed at record pace? Goodman could have played Ruth...but he'd have needed to drop some weight...lots of it.  Ruth was a great athlete and while his weight fluctuated he was never the blob that Goodman is.  I remember seeing this movie when it first played in theatres and until I actually saw real footage of Ruth and learned the true story years later did I realize what a travesty this "movie of the week" type project is.... BEST THING ABOUT THIS DVD?  the two bonus featurettes starring the real BABE RUTH as bonus features...they alone are worth the ten bucks 
 This book is so full of lies, half truths, misquotes, out of context quotes and manipulations that it would even make the devil blush. Actually, simple research will find many blatant lies in all of her books. She uses end notes in her books, but calls them footnotes. Endnotes are much harder to research as compared to footnotes and appear at the end of the book, not at the bottom of the page. I could list each lie, but the review would be pages long, especially when typing out the quotes she uses and the real quotes. Do your own research if you'd like, and I challenge Ann Coulter's fans to research her lies. But I digress, I think that most people who read her books, however, just want to reconfirm what they already believe and will not bother to research inaccuracies. Her most famous style of lying however, is using newspaper quotes out of context, or changing what the person said, or simply just making it up. A simple LexisNexis Search will reveal most of her lies. I found that more than 60% of this book was made up, twisted, or taken out of context, the other 40% was name-calling, insulting broad generalisations,and angry ranting which is, ironically, slander itself. Wow, what a great view of the Republican Right. If I were a Republican, I would NOT be proud to have her on my team. She is juevenile, brash, and most of all, a liar. I hope she fazes out of favor with the American public because she is toxic and an example of what is wrong in American Politics today, despite what side of the fence you sit on. I feel that lying to prove your point and name-calling is poisenous, egregious and morally bankrupt, no matter what political party you belong to. Do yourself a favor, and read a book by another author. If you do choose to read this, I challenge you to look further into what she writes. The lies begin in the first few pages.   
 Using this book and CD-ROM depends upon being able to download the customized settings, so that the reader's PhotoShop, for example, behaves the same way as the author's PhotoShop. However, my system repeatedly hung up on that section of the download from the CD-ROM. Furthermore, this author doesn't start at a "dummies" level by defining the terms that he uses throughout the lessons, so I had trouble following along. Overall, this wasn't much help for me in my quest to learn PhotoShop from a baseline of complete ignorance 
 This movie was good for the most part but then again if you dont want to see drunk indians shoot white people then dont worry about seeing it. There were some good parts in this movie but the whole movie was a rather large dissapointment. These Indains would kill people so they could get their Jollies off by getting alcohol for it, even though the story wasnt to be based on this. This movie was very unrealistic as far as that actually happening, like if someone to be arrested they wouldnt be let go OR given a gun, and all the actors should be reformed and be made better through my eyes. I take my reviews very serioulsly and this movie was not that good at all, do not let your children be scared by watching this movie. John Wayne was a good actor props to my man Wayne, he's my man. However his career could have been a lot better off had he not made this movie 
 I thought this mat would be good for catching the litter my cat flings out of the box but really it just ended up catching some of the litter and looking like an ugly eye-sore. It also hurts to walk on with bare feet. Having wood floors, I hate sweeping 3-4 times daily because my cats get a little too over zealous trying to cover up their waste in the litter box, so I thought I'd give it a try. Helped some, but overall I'd say not worth the money 
 I bought this bed for my son who loves superheroes. I thought it would look great in his newly redectorated room. It does look great if you can manage to get it together. The instructions that came with the bed were not clear or detailed. It uses hex screws to assemble it, it does include a small wrench, but that is a pain.  With me and my huband working together to assemble the bed it took us 4 hrs to do it. We have put togehter many beds, cribs, and other things over the years, this was HIGHLY difficult. The rails that support the mattress were not manufactured properly. Thankfully my father-in-law uses the same type of metal piping at his factory. We replaced what came with the bed with metal piping he made. The piping the bed came with would not stay in the slots, the piping was cut an half an inch too short. So anytime the bed was moved, wiggled, or sat upon the they would fall out. Thus making the mattress fall onto the floor.  My son was so happy to have gotten the bed, and when we had to tell him that he would have to wait a day before he could use it he was heart broken. All together once it is assembled it does look like the photo. I would NOT have purchased this item if I had know that it would require so much work and us having to replace parts that should have worked in the first place. The superman photos that are on the bed are large stickers that you have to stick on the headboard and footboard when assembling the product. The bed also comes with an asortment of screws and bolts to assemble the bed with. In the packaging they are NOT clearly marked so that you can tell the difference between them. It was difficult deciding which screws to use, and the screw holes in the material was NOT alienged properly. My husband had to re-bore most of the screw holes on the frame just so that we could screw and bold the bed together. I do NOT recommend purchasing this item unless you are prepared to work on it. The only good thing about this item is that it does ship quickly. I had it in less that a week from the order date. 
 This CD is the worst music I have ever heard. It ranks below elevator music. It even is worse then porn movie music. It is trite, poorly composed and sets my teeth on edge. It is worse then that infamous CD called classical pop. I pity the fool (myself included) that buys this CD.  
 This book has an over-reaching title and at best is a catalog that describes toys.  Placing the words "special needs" in the title implies that it would provide specific pointers for helping children with all sorts and degrees of disabilities like CP, visual impairments, hearing impairments, deafblindness, mental retardation, etc. and might at least have a section on augmentative communications.  It offers VERY LITTLE on these topics.  As for the dialogues, I found them to be of poor quality and contrary to other stuff I have read.  Some of the dialogues for a child who hasn't begun to talk have tons of words and lots of adjectives yet later the same book suggests that teaching the concepts of 'up' and 'down' in the same play session might be too confusing for the child.  I don't know what the author's Ph.D. is in but I hope it isn't in speech and language pathology 
 Last summer we bought two of these cruisers and both of them broke after only one month of normal use.  The water squirt function quit working after only a week.  My kids LOVED them, but for the price these cruisers are, they need to be built to last 
 I should have read all of the reviews because this book was not approprite for any ages.  It was disgusting, crude and downright nasty.  My daughter started to read the book and threw it in the trash before my grandchildren could read it.  Please, Please, DO NOT buy this book.  The author should be ashamed of himself for putting this on the marker for kids and shame on amazon for allowing it.  
 The premise of this book seemed very appealing to me. I have always been very opinionated about "Branding" teenagers, and while in high school I refused to wear well known brand-name clothes. However, once I got into actually reading the book, I was very dissapointed. Quart seemed, at least to me, to merely skim the surface of the problem, filling the pages with statistics and endless lists of numbers but not really pulling much meaning out of any of it. It also seemed to me that she focused most of her attention on the "rich" kids. I feel that a comparison between priviledged and average teenagers, even severely underpriviledged teens, would have made the book much more interesting. It got especially frustration for me when I reached the chapter titled "Logo U" because (my being fresh out of highschool) I felt that she was exaggerating, or else obviously not expanding her interviews for children NOT from wealthy families. I never took an SAT course, never bought an expensive SAT book but still did perfectly well on my SATs, and got into several excellent colleges.  I understand that the point she was trying to make was about teens getting the "Logo U"s in their minds and refusing to be denied access to them, but I feel the endless droning about SATs offered nothing to feed that point and just made me try to compare the information to my own experience, with little, if any, success. I apologize for my review being so unorganized. I am no professional writer myself 
 While I do not want to sound offensive to the authors, I was almost offended at the simplistic level of Six Sigma description that was used in this book.  You can skip the first two chapters completely and browse the rest of the text.  The case studies are applicable and actually fairly good.  The authors almost make it seem as though anything being done is already at a Six Sigma level, you simply need to make the numbers match.  There is no real tie to making Six Sigma work in healthcare in this book.  Having done a great deal of reading and research on Six Sigma, I would recommend that anyone wanting to utilize this great technique in a healthcare setting stick with Six Sigma books geared for traditional business and use them to apply principles to healthcare.  In my opinion, this book was approximately $65 over-priced.  Thanks to the authors, however, on a valiant effort 
 Terrible is all I can say.  This author breaks every rule he suggests to you.  The introduction is boring.  It is small story chapters with a bold sentence or two at the end.  These are the principles he is suggesting.  You can read these bold sentences in less than 30 minutes.  Don't bother to buy this book. 
 People are SO gullable, how many morons carry around this book while listening to Marilyn Manson on their ipods thinking that they are exploring the "dark arts"? Lovecraft invented the Necronomican to tie his stories together into what has become known as the Cthulu mythos. I can't fault the author for trying to make a buck but anyone who thinks this is anything but fiction should contact me about a bridge I'm selling in Brooklyn 
 A few chosen people are meant to be artists. Of the artists, there are painters: others sculptors, musicians, poets or writers.  For some, like Neal Cassady, their medium was Being.   Although a muse for the likes of Ginsberg, Kerouac, and Ferlingetti, and in many ways the adrenaline to the Beat Generation, Cassady was not a writer.  Writing wasn't Neal's gig.  Perhaps the pen was too slow for him; the medium just couldn't convey his essence. Rather Neal was a live show. It seems cruel to find him trapped on paper - like watching a tiger at the zoo, the wild drained off through those all confining bars.   The first few chapters of The First Third are slow and seem forced.  However, the vibe changes drastically once Neal's family tree is throughly discussed.  It's as if Cassady has quit the pretentious wordplay and dictated thoughts to paper, which give the remainder of the book a much more genuine feel.   The most enlightening segment of the book is the select correspondence between Neal, Jack Kerouac, Ken Kesey and others. It provides an insight into Neal that is raw, unedited and seems a much more accurate description than Cassady's own attempt at biography.      
 I was disappointed in this book. I was expecting some historically accurate designs and what I received was overly simplified plans presumably designed mostly for children. Yes, most of the text is related to the history of these weapons, but the plans left something to be desired. The ballista plan suggests use of a peanut as ammunition (not a bolt?) and the catch mechanism is nonexistent. The last project is a plastic-spoon-based basketball game. Enough said 
 I have been a big fan of New Found Glory since "All Downhill From Here" came out. I bought Catalyst and loved it, so I bought all their old albums, loved them all too. I found out New Found Glory had a new cd coming out.....couldnt wait. So i go out and buy this cd the day it came out, I was that excited, I brought it home thinking "all right, this will be awesome!!!" Over the next 40-some minutes I experienced the biggest dissapointment of my life. Every song was a ballad, there were no fun songs like "Hit or Miss" "Forget My Name" "The Great Houdini" "Your Biggest Mistake" or even an amazingly well written song like "No News Is Good News." I basically got a whole cd of "I Don't Wanna Know" which in my mind was New Found Glory's worst song to date. I listened to this cd once, and I barely made it through to the end and when it was over, I seriously considered throwing it in the trash. This band has died, after all those years of fun and great songs, they have been destroyed. I will do my best to erase this peice from my mind so I can enjoy their old albums again 
 Having read the first 3 Women's Murder Club books, this fourth in the series didn't even come close to the previously set standard.  The two unrelated story lines felt gimmicky, but would've been tolerable if each of the plots had been better designed. The court scenes needed to be better researched.  Look, I'm NOT a lawyer, but even I know that civil court is different.  And I also know enough about procedures to know you don't do any "I Object!"s during opening statements.  And by the way, can you even sue a cop for doing her job?  Don't you have to sue the city, and/or the Police Department?  And on, and on.  I don't know if James Patterson or Maxine Paetro wrote that part of the book, but his/her/their ignorance was pretty glaring. As to the serial murders, that wasn't bad, but it felt like this story line was simply tacked on and hurriedly resolved - not very satisfying. And finally, this wasn't a Women's Murder Club mystery.  It was a Lindsay Boxer mystery.  The other club members had cameo roles and zero participation in the crime solving 
 I have NOT seen the movie, so this review is only based on the book.  This book was highly regarded by a few family members as a beautiful read.  Sure, the descriptions are lovely and well written, but the whole idea of a memoir is suppose to be interesting--this is not.  I love travel memoirs, reading peoples travel stories, but this was like reading a guide to restore a house--very dry.  Ms. Mayes writing reminds me of David Sedaris mocking a wealthly tourist, "My home, well... ONE of my homes".    I have decided to give the book another try. XM Sonic Theater is playing the book and it is being read by the author.  However, Ms. Mayes monotone voice and lack of live storytelling makes the story even worse.  I understand why authors have voice actors to read the books.    The book is written lovely, but does not exceed the expectation I was excepting. 
 Another disappointed customer.   I have very thick, coarse, wavy hair and trying to manage it is a nightmare! Before using Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I was using Aveda's Be Curly Lotion and Matrix's Curl.Life contouring creme. Both of the latter products work very well with my hair. I don't like to blow dry my hair (too time-consuming), so I just air dry it. Without blow drying, whether I'm using Aveda or Matrix, the results are great! My hair is smooth, shiny, and less frizzy.  I had never used Fekkai's products before, but decided to give this one a try. Everything Luscious Curl Enhancing Lotion claimed to do, didn't do for my hair. In fact, it actually made my hair worst! It became stiffer, drier looking, frizzier. In addition, my wavy hair, (usually bouncy and alive), became flat and dull. Also, I didn't like the scent of this particular curling lotion. It was very strong smelling and made me nauseous.    Because of my very poor experience with Fekkai's Luscious Curls lotion, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I think I'll stick to the Aveda and Matrix curling lotions, since they are much more compatible with my hair. 
 but Ridley devotes too much space regurgitating tired, old, discredited dogmas on both sides of the nature-versus-nurture debate. I think his views are self-evident to many non-specialists, like myself, outside the sociobiolgical fishbowl.     As a physical scientist, I am often disturbed by the (in my opinion) misplaced empiricisms of behavioural/social scientists. For exapmle, in one part of the book, Ridley describes a "remarkable" experiment that found children with a certain high-active gene (MAOA) are "virtually immune" to the detrimental effects of mistreatment by their care-givers, and did not "get into trouble much", as compared to those with low-active versions of the gene. The implication is that this could become a tool of social policy. The thought of engineers building Jumbo Jets according to principles of gravitation, mechanics, and fluid dynamics that "ought to work a lot of the time" would be a disaster in the making - much like, in my opinion, social policy built along the thinking he outlines. Personally, I would be much more interested in low and high-ative MAOA children who flaunt the conventional conclusions of the study (of which I assume there are some, based on the language). Perhaps it is the exceptions that hold the key.     I'm not saying that physics/math/engineering is superior to the social/behavioural sciences. I think that it is important to know where the fuzzy edges of reductionist-empiricisms lie, and where to draw boundaries around them. I just think that physical scientists, by the nature of their fields, tend to have better tools for drawing and testing these boundaries. Without these boundaries, there seems to be a temptation to take conclusions too far, and be lead astray as a result. 
 First off, I want to say that whatever the reason Eerdmans published this book, it was not very wise. Why not just have Deseret publish this? Should we expect Eerdmans to now find a Muslim cleric and prove how the Islamic Jesus is the same? How about the Jesus of the Watchtower? Just the very idea that a Christian publisher is producing this book gives the wrong impression. A debate, I can understand. But a treatment like this, I just do not comprehend the rationale.  Next, I want to say that Robert Millet is one of the smartest men around. After all, if your product--in this case, Mormonism--doesn't have all the history of, say, a Coca-cola, what is the best tactic you could have in order to make your Johnny-come-lately "Foda-soda" sell? Of course, compare yourself to the original and  show how the two sodas are so much alike. This is what Millet has been able to accomplish, not only with this book but with his converasation-with-an-evangelical meetings that make Mormonism look so "Christian." It's akin to having the wolf over for dinner and making him wait in your sheep pen (with your prized animals) while you go to the store. It won't take long before the innocent will become wolf chow. I think the Bible is very clear to differentiate ourselves from those around us. Hence, the book of Galatians--Paul's first book--is adament that false gospels should have no place in our lives (Gal. 1:8,9). This is why the second epistle of John tells us not to allow someone who does not have the same faith take the pulpit. (And isn't this what Eerdman's has done?)  I will give the book a second star, though, because there are some times when Millet does give some evidence that the Jesus and gospel of Mormonism are indeed different from the definitions of the historic Christian faith. However, more often than not, he doesn't do this very clearly. For instance, in his glossary, he describes Jesus as having "the only name by which salvation can come." Now what exactly does this mean? Is he referring to justification, as Acts 4:12 is talking about? Does this mean good works are not necessary to progress to the celestial kingdom? He goes on with the definition, yet there is nothing that would trouble the typical Evangelical Christian who has not had a chance to study the LDS religion. (This was confirmed to me just a minute ago when I read this paragraph to my friend.) The problem comes because Mormons and Christians use the same terminology (i.e. Jesus, saved, salvation, etc.) but have different meanings attached. I noticed that Millet is able to get away with this, most times, because he utilizes quotes that muddle the situation and does not clearly communicate to the Christian how different the two gospels are. He also loves to quote Christians who seem to support his position. For instance, he (like many LDS) loves C.S. Lewis. I'm wondering if the Latter-day Saints believe that Lewis was a closet Mormons or something. While Lewis did not have perfect theology, his main ideas (including those from Mere Christianity) are not in accordance with the teachings of Mormonism.  My final word concerns Richard Mouw's support of this book, apparently the key person who helped get it published. Mouw writes on page 183: "I think that an open-minded Christian reader of this book will sense that Bob Millet is in fact trusting in the Jesus of the Bible afor his salvation." My goodness. Millet describes Jesus--with nobody questioning his definitions or conclusions--and a Christian seminary president appears to accept him at his word and practically declare him a Christian brother in the Lord. This really takes the cake, and I must say that the Mormons certainly must think that Millet is a very useful person in their movement as he helps make Mormonism into one of Protestant's largest denominations. If I were a Mormon, I would probably apply to Mouw's seminary and use this experience to give myself even more credibility with Christian audiences. Truly this type of foolishness must certainly make the Jesus as described in the Bible very sad indeed 
 I found this book to be poorly reasoned.  While the author claims to have well supported conlcusions,  the vast majority of her conclusions do NOT follow from the research she cites.   In light of the events at VA Tech in the last week, I would note that there was one individual who fit the profile of her book, but the reaction of the vast majority of students, both at VA Tech, and around the world, indicated what a wonderful generation of thoughtful young people are coming into their place in the world 
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 In Momaday's Pulitzer Prize winning novel "House Made of Dawn," a young Native-American Indian named Abel, returns to Walatow Reservation in New Mexico from World War II. Only to discover that he is caught between two worlds. This book is a great example of Native-American fiction, it reveals the hardships of the Native-Americna people. Anyone who loves a good book based on storytelling and myth will find this book a must-read. It draws the reader in, with it's vivid description of the landscapes and ceremonies. At first I was a bit apprehensive in reading this book, because I have been told this is not a good book to read if you're reading Momaday's work for the first time. Yet, I enjoyed reading it, I apprieciated Momaday's effort to draw the reader in with the struggle of Native-American Indians living in industrial America. I recommend this book to anyone who is in search of a good book 
 Whatever ills are in the world, it's all the fault of the corporations. That's the basic premise of this terribly misguided one-sided and totally non-objective movie. For example, instead of saying how terrible it is for companies paying people in the developing world peanuts for their work, they forget that these people's alternatives ARE EVEN WORSE and that's why they took that job in the first place!  These jobs provide them with one of the few options they have and, if they chose that job freely, it must be their BEST option, no matter how crazy it seems to us. As people's skills rise, as opportunities increase over time (by having MORE corporations and not less, to create more competition for these people's labor), and as the country becomes wealthier, these people's wages will rise automaticaly and in fact, the wages of the whole country on the average.  There are no shortcuts to his.  A famous story comes from Nepal where anti-child labor laws, at the urging of the UN, turned thousands of kids overnight into prostitutes as those jobs, as sad as it may be, were their best options to avoid starvation and feed their families.  It's a slow process, but all the industrialized nations went through that process.  Government-mandated "shortcuts" usually produce results which are even worse.  However, the results speak for themselves: in VERY short period of time, for example, HUNDRDS OF MILLIONS of people were lifted out of poverty in China, India and around the world thanks for the "evil" capalism & its corporations.  No other system has ever done it so quickly as in the past 15 years in China and India alone.  Also, cost of living is very low there, so these pennies really can go a long way, don't measure it to the cost of living in the West.  What is the filmmakers alternative they offer for these people? I guess to let people starve to death, then the makers of this movie don't have have anyting to complain about!?  Other examples of stupidity include showing that a company is like a person who's a psychopath.  A corpoartion is a legal entity yes, and may act like a separate "being" as far the law in concerned, but does a corporation have a nose, feet, stomach? Can it eat apples or sneeze or have arthritis? Of course, not, than how can you attach a human idea like a psychopath to it??  Several of the main "spokepersons" in the movie, Chomsky, Michael Moore, Rifkin and others are renowned for their off-the-wall comments which frequently have NO basis in any kind of economics or reality.  To correct the inaccuracies in the statements made by these and other people in the movie, you'd have to stop it every 5 minutes and explain to the audience how profoundly wrong the statements are.  Throughout the whole movie, you're basically bombarded by one-sided arguments with VERY little of the other side presented, despite the director's claim of the opposite 9they claim 1/2 & 1/2, it's more like 80%-20%).  Just look at Chomsky's comments about how the consumers are so stupid, they don't realize that all the things they buy they don't really need. I mean we don't need fashionable clothes (hey, let's all dress as boring as Chomsky!), DVD players, or any new gadgets that make life easier or more fun.  Who is the judge of what you REALLY need?  Chomsky, of course. He is the final arbiter of what you really need or what you don't. You're too stupid to know what you want, according to him. He says that you should do "more important things", like...perhaps studying lingistics (which he teaches but which very few care about).  The movie DOES make some correct and good observations, especially regarding polution, however, I'd say that 80% of the movie is factually and logically flawed. It's also FULL of economic fallacies. It's worth watching I guess, just to see how many errors one can make in just 1 movie.  Despite all the ranting in the movie, it fails to mention THE biggest reason of most of the problems it brings up - too much governement interference is every facet of life.  For examples, how could a Government of Brazil forbit the people of collecting rain water! How could the U.S. government do so many things for private companies with public funds?  Just forbid the governments from playing favorites with companies, forbid government corporate welfare of ANY kind, forbid subsidies to companies, cut the suffocating red tape and regulation (esp. in developing countries but in the West too), cut corporate taxes to 5 or 10% (and see unemployment rate go to almost nothing, give people all around the world a better life, increase competition, etc.)  If these and other governments (and not corporations') problems were eliminated, the vast majority of ALL the problems which the movie brings up will simply go away.  An interesing film for anyone to see how the truth can be twisted by mindless people with an agenda to go back to 15th century rural lifestile (spoken about with much admiration), people with NO understanding about economics, how the world really works and how to REALLY raise the billions out of poverty who this movie does the biggest disservice for. 
 This text will be a chore to read for most American students who are new to GIS.  Although the author(s) manage to cram alot of information into the relatively short chapters, the sentences are long and difficult to understand because of the overly wordy, jargon-filled 'proper' use of British English & spellings.  If you decide to purchase this book, then I highly recommend the 'Oxford Unabridged English Dictionary' to go along with it.  The majority of the students in my class "Geographic Information Systems I" at Southwest Texas State University, which has one of the best geography programs in the nation, felt the same way I do, and also thought that the book was too advanced for an introductory GIS class.  I think that the professors at Southwest Texas State University are now using a different text for that class.  Also, people always complain that books tend to be geared toward a single software program- Well, like it or not, in the United States, ESRI has a monopoly on geographic software so you are going to have to learn ArcView/Info one way or another 
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 Even though the book shows a published date of February 2005, the writing in the book keeps referring to 2002 as the current date.  The book is also written by people in the U.K. for people in the U.K.  The parts I did read also left out important data, such that by using canola oil, nitrogen oxides actually decrease.  Certainly most of the book has useful information, but for the reasons mentioned, I would recommend to keep looking for a book for the American audience 
 Barenboim's playing of these three famous sonatas perfectly summarizes his playing of the other twenty-nine: unfelt, not musical, forgetting dynamic accents and staccato marks, too loud in the forte and too soft in the piano sections. I don't hear any spontaneity here, nor freshness, drama or even passion. These are party recordings at their best. The slow movements of all three sonatas are uniformly flat that it's hard to keep your attention with them. The fast movements suffer either from thorough dullness (he plays all the notes of the first movements of both Pathetique and Appassionata but that's about it) or, even worse, dullness in combination with banging (the final movements of all three sonatas). I've never heard the main theme in the last movement of the Appassionata sound this boring. Nor have I heard anyone play the movement's last minute this ugly. And he omits the repeat! The Mondschein's final: same story. There are SO many better recordings of these three sonatas that it's rather ashaming to see EMI put Barenboim's recordings in the 'great recordings of the century' series. EMI is that company that has a load of great Beethoven recordings by Edwin Fischer lying in its store vaults, but seemlingly prefers to release mediocre, dull readings like these. Anyway, if you want to hear these pieces in better renditions, you'd best go for Arrau's disc with these three sonatas on Philips (which is cheaper too), Brendel's two-fer with the 'favourite' sonatas or Gilels' recordings on DG. For an entire sonatas set, Kovacevich is also recommended. Barenboim's readings of Beethoven are thoroughly uninteresting and don't deserve any attention in such a crowded catalogue 
 The Kidz Bop series is the ultimate travesty in music. And don't think that it's good just because your kids might love it. Kids also like to eat McDonalds, but don't try telling me that their food is healthy. There is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children. And, surprisingly, a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children, even with the expletives deleted. There is no reason on earth why these records should exist, excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish. I agree with the person who suggested the Beatles as an alternative. Seriously, don't buy this! 
 after get shorty, e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again, with this single-minded purpose focused, e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty. and he was right again, it was bought and made into a movie again, but pathetically, a horrible one compared to get shorty. the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind. i simply failed to find there's any interest in reading this going nowhere story. it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie, with all the bore-to-death script, dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap. how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles, especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty'? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose'? and at every corner of los angeles, every table in any restaurant, almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer'? and you have to ask yourself: since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer, even a director in person? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are? yeah, maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show? give me a break! this book, from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer, so shallow and so superficious! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in 
 The Tradegy of this book is actually reading it. Unless you are tortured by your professors and have to read this for a class I suggest you stay as far away from it as possible. Oh so boring 
 In the USSR, the state would havew a training class to teach children there is no God.  All the children (roughly the same age as would be reading this book) would have to put their heads down and pray for a cookie.  Then they were to lift their heads.  No cookie would be there of course.  Then they were told to ask the state for a cookie and then put their heads down.  When they did, someone would go around and put a cookie on everyone's desk.  This book uses the same sort of logic to make the reverse argument.  If it wasn't right the first time, it isn't right now, and what is terrifying is that truth and fact no longer have the weight they once did.    There is NO argument in the scientific community about evolution as others would have you believe.  There is an argument AGAINST the scientific community by people who no nothing about science, but know plenty about politics and law.  So your child may be reading this horror story in the near future so we can make our way back to burning women at the stake if they float when thrown bound and gagged into the river 
 Blowing my Cover is a young woman's memoir of a short-lived CIA career.  The middle and end of the book were intesting (CIA training and post 9/11).  The rest was boring.  Moran actually writes that she was destined for a CIA spy job because she liked to treasure hunt as a child!  Yawn.  Moran never convinced me that she really wanted to be in the CIA or that she was truly "wired" as a spy.  Her motivations for getting out were believable but that doesn't happen until the last 40 or so pages.  I found myself skimming the middle of the book to find out why she ultimately left.  Moran's book has some interesting tidbits about becoming a spy but it lacks passion and emotion 
 the supplier sent me a second rate product. I expected a beautiful clean cut hardcover book to keep for ever... but instead i got a book that bad oddly cut pages. I am very annoyed and hope that the supplier sends books that are of good quality. the books is defineatly going to be a superd read.. but i wish that the seller sells quality produts. i am pissed 
 This book is less about Carnegie than it is about the Homestead plant's labor unrest.  And on this topic the author is an unabashed labor partisan.  He unfailingly calls replacement workers "scabs", routinely uses inflamatory language like "... crumbs for the angry masses" or "pigheaded" to describe Carnegie and his partners.    Nasaw reveals little about what made Carnegie such a spectacular business success.  Evidently he was lucky and had "the gift of gab."  The fact that Carnegie's efficient plants resulted in steady employment for thousands, and cheaper steal for a growing economy is dismissed as propaganda for the rich industrialist.  Nasaw never explains why striking workers at Homestead had the right to blockade Carnegie's agents from entering the site. In his view, they had such a right by virtue of their work, and hence bore no responsibility for the ensuing violence.  The rule of law doesn't seem to play much role in his thinking.  
 Another money making scheme dreamed up by the marketing department.  This is not how D&D is supposed to be played 
 VERY GOOD PRODUCT VERY SATIsfied, the night vision is great clarity is very good and portability is awesome plus the price is even bette 
 My mother bought this for me for Christmas. She used the "available new and used" section to get it a little cheaper. She ended up paying $160 or so. When I put this on my wish list I thought that this hardcover version would be the Arabic-English/English-Arabic, considering that it was $175 and the paperback of the Arabic-English only was available for $45. As it turns out, this is only the hardcover of the Arabic-English only. So for one, my mother paid an additional $115 for only the hardcover version of a book that I could have gotten in the paperback for $45. I still do not have the English-Arabic of the Hans Wehr edition 
 Best in genre? What genre are these people talking about - most boring book about Russians?  I threw this out after 100 or so pages. I couldn't take any more.   BORING 
 I totally agree with the other reviewers that when it comes to Canadian rock, most of the choice tracks are left out in favour of commercial pap. While "Lay it on the Line" has to be the biggest power rock song of all time from a three man group there are sadly,  a lot of omissions. In addition to the ones mentioned I would also include "Young Enough to Cry" from the "Just a Game" album. A better blues guitar song you will never hear, at least not on this compilation. 
 Don't waste your time or money on this book.  It was about as interesting as watching paint dry!  Maybe Danielle Steel should take a break from writing if this is all she can churn out 
 Very poor analysis of West African civilizations. For example, Ghana was a very significant Soninke empire in Western Africa, yet barely any attention at all is paid to it. To make matters worse, the author was so desperate to disregard it that he threw in a baseless and eurocentric statement that its capital may have been "founded by whites from the North". Fact is, there were no "whites" to the North. The only light skin berbers nearby were mixed-race "browns". 
 You have to ask yourself, "Why did William Grimes think there was the need for another culinary dictionary?".  As you read the book, the answer comes quickly, before you're even very far into the "A's"... apparently he didn't. I was repeatedly disappointed by the cursory, often puerile definitions which accompany most of the 2000 culinary terms Grimes presents.  The simplistic line or two of text each are accompanied by are often incomplete and sometimes down right misleading. The introduction builds up the book as a necessary tool to help we little folk through the growing complexities of modern food buying and eating.  In a world no longer dominated by a few French terms we are led to believe that this book will bridge the gap between old-school cooking books (say, from before 1990) and the current state of culinaria.  Why then are so many of the terms defined in an out-dated, even archaic mind-set? Take  the term "brown sugar".  This book says it is "unrefined or partially refined sugar", a definition all well and good perhaps 200 years ago.  Today brown sugar is almost always made from refined sugar with a special molasses syrup and colorings added back to it - a very different thing indeed, and Grimes should know the difference.  The are innumerable other examples available in the same vein. Additionally, Grimes give us  "food lists" scattered periodically throughout the book but provides only sporadic support for the words used in them.  For example, there is a list of Varieties of Apples.  48 varieties are listed but when one wants more information on them it is often lacking.  Sure "Red Delicious" apples have an insipid definition in the "R" section but what about the more interesting varieties like "Sundowner", or "Lodi" apples?  No further mention of them can be found in the book.  There is also a huge list of  "Fish and Seafood" but if you are intrigued by what the "Geoduck" or "Sprat" listed might be, you're out of luck (without running to a REAL culinary dictionary). The bright (if limited) spots in the book are the articles on food etymology and history.  There are 7 of them (reprints from other publications and various authors) that are each informative and interesting.  Grimes would have done much better to have put together a collection of these little insightful gems and left the definitions to those more inspired by the subject. My guess is that the brevity of the definitions (leading to rampant deficiencies) was, perhaps, an attempt at simplicity but the effective "dumbing-down" of the book is insulting to anything but the most elementary reader.  I know that Grimes, a former restaurant reviewer for the New York Times, must know a lot more about food than this book makes him sound.  Grimes is listed as the "editor" of this work (along with a number of others) and it defies logic why he would allow his name used as the primary. Unfortunately, my copy of this book is destined for "re-gifting" or a permanent place on a dusty shelf somewhere while my venerable, dog-eared Larousse Gastronomic retains it's place of honor near my desk. Bon appetite, ex libris, and caveat emptor. DH 
 Classic brick AC/DC transformer is for North America only. I hoped for a "dual voltage" AC/DC convertor which could be used overseas 
 I loved Girl's Guide and have to agree with most of the reviewers below.  I was so looking forward to another fun, interesting read and for once could not actually finish a book, unusual for me as I will stick with anything unless it's terrible.  This book is just so boring, no spunk or humor; it just fell flat.  I am also finding the Jewish thing to be getting a bit old and overdone in novels these days...aren't there any other ethnic groups to be written about 
 I stopped reading this book when it said that low self-esteem is a possible cause of thyroid antibodies. I'm a research psychologist and am very familiar with psychosomatic research, so I feel qualified to say that this is complete hooey. There are too many sections in this book that smack of unscientific thinking and unsubstantiated comment. I bought this book hoping for practical advice, and there is some of that. But there is also a fatal overdose of hippie stuff. A better book is Mary Solomon's What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Hypothyroidism 
 As one other reviewer notes, it's incredibly poorly written. The info is not new, not helpful, not... well, let's just say I saw it a conventional (offline, independent) bookstore, thought it was a cute title, and, being as short on time that day as I almost always am short on sleep, I didn't leaf through it before buying it. MISTAKE!   I really resented paying money for this piece of self-congratulatory-ness. I'm glad the author found something that worked for him, I'm glad he suffered and then interrupted the cycle: hooray for anyone who does that, in any area of life. But it sure didn't do anything for me, and didn't tell me anything I didn't know.   Aggravating waste of trees.  
 By my reckoning, this book is a wordy, round-about, flawed argument for exploitation of natural gas to substitute for rapidly depleting oil reserves. After peeling away the accolades, one sees that the authors are apologists for the American way of life, but it is strange that they don't seem to come to grips with the fact that North America has long since peaked in natural gas. (Google Oil Crisis and check the gas.) Furthermore, transporting natural gas over large distances is extremely inefficient and sustains US dependency on foreign energy sources, contradicting the authors' stated objectives.   If US security is the goal, then promoting a home-grown solution is the only sensible way forward. Solar and wind energy in mass production will be far more economical and require far less energy to deploy in comparison with fossil fuels and nuclear power. 
 I used to really like US magazine. I have been collecting every issue each week for several years now. But wait! Has anyone else noticed that this magazine has drastically changed since the beginning of this year? Where are all the interesting articles and info on the celebrities, movies and music? There's no more than a thumbnail's sketch of info on anything now. It's all photos and quickie hype. It has no more substance. What happened to this good magazine 
 Brown Girl Peer Review  To my Peers:   I would recommend Brown Girl to all of my fellow peers.  This is a story that shows many problems.  One was that most of us do not have positive remodels to look up to.  Therefore, we just go about our life without anyone to look up.  To the same exact way, the character in this story grew up also.  However, always someone came so that we can look up to.  However, that does not always happen to us.  So there are certain times or situations that are not the same as our life but most of the time we can relate to the work.  As a person in life. So we can really understand what the character was going through so we would be able to say that we would have done the same thing.  Therefore, we would under stand the story a lot better.  In addition, like in the story, we could do better in receiving feedback and using it in a good way .so; we can use that to improve our selves.  This would show that we understand what we are doing. And we can go further into detail in every problem in the book. And further understand what the character was going through. 
 I have a theory: Steven Saylor has an identical, yet evil, twin brother named "Spike." I've come to this conclusion after reading the first four chapters of his most recent novel (actually, it's more a collection of inter-related short stories than a novel).  You see the Steven Saylor that we've all come to love wrote the excellent Roma Sub Rosa series. I've purchased and read every book in the series (in fact, I've read them all twice). But after reading the first four chapters of Roma I'm absolutely convinced that Spike Saylor, masquerading as Steven, approached St. Martin's Press and was able to publish this dreck under his brother's name.  I'm astounded at how truly awful this book is: the characters are two-dimensional; they have height and width but no depth whatsoever. The dialogue is embarrassingly bad. While reading this on the subway (in NYC) I found myself physically flinching and had to put the book away in my backpack. I preferred to read the subway adverts instead -- they were more engaging.  If I had Steven's phone number or e-mail address I'd inform him that Spike  has escaped from the asylum and that the police should be notified immediately to stop him from sullying his reputation any further.  MY RECOMMENDATION: skip this turkey 
 This book is dripping with the worst kind of technology hype...  Very few redeeming qualities...  Don't waste your time/$ 
  Compare to the first edition, major improvement include libraries of C++ code but unfortunately, lack of explanations.  No offense to Mr.Shirley, but this book is riddled with errors, some of the materials provided at the end of each chapters were DIFFERENT from the code on the server. Not sure which one should be follow.  If you intend to write you own path-tracer from scratch, I will definitely not recommend this book. Reading this book requires knowledge on much other theories, such as calculus, probability and other... which were very briefly mentioned in the text.   If you intend to understand global illumination and radiometry, I would recommend "Advanced Global Illumination" by Philip Dutre, Philippe Bekaert and Kavita Bala. This is a much better book which explains things clearly. 
 This book never touches on aid climbing it says half of what John Long says in his "How to rock climb" series, but not nearly as well 
 I had bought the book on the strength of the seemingly unanimous five-star reviews. It became clear within minutes that this is the proverbial caveat emptor. One is left wondering how many of these reviews are planted by friends and/or relatives because - anyone with half a brain is able to quickly determine that the book is mostly rubbish. It is a self-published job, amateurishly produced and even more amateurishly written. It has 96 numbered pages, but chapter 1 only starts on p. 11 and the last chapter ends on p. 82. In between you have another 13 pages of blah testimonials with photos of those giving them - likely the author's idea of flattering all her friends ("Oh look, I'm in a book"). Need I say that all the photos, besides being of execrable quality, are well nigh useless on the instructional front? The author is a "certified reboundologist". Correspondence course, anyone? She is "dedicated to...assisting people to care for their Holy Temples for...planetary healing". 'Nuff said? She endorses a single manufacturer of Rebounders whose name she can't spell right (p. 78). Be warned 
 I was dissapointed with this book.  It lacks ANY information about many common gems, including jade, obsidian, black tourmaline, moonstone, etc.   This is a "glossy" book designed to attract the new age crowd who may just have a passing interest and want a VERY basic introduction.  However, for anyone who is serious about gem and energy medicine, especially naturopaths or others interested in making gem elixers, I would NOT recommend this book.  It simply lacks enough complete information 
 I have read a lot of DS books and this is the worst one yet.  It was repetitive; the story was totally mundane, not even a little bit intriguing and the ending predictable.  I read it to the end hoping it was going to get better but it never did.  For a writer of her caliber and reputation she ought to know better.  The only good point - it didn't take long to read.  This is the last DS book I'll ever buy 
 If you wish to read something for entertainment's sake, then this book will suffice. Written by an English Professor, this book lacks the sort of critical thought those of us in the science deptartments want for. Purportedly an 'Abbreviated History Of Western Manhood,' it is rather an exercise in academic arcana - an attempt to think of something through its opposite or, in this case, its abuse. One is hardly compelled to reconsider ideas about what manhood means. There is nothing in Taylor's "treatise" to support such nonsense as, "This is a specter that has haunted men for centuries: the fear that manhood will become, or has already become, obsolete, superfluous, ridiculous, at best quaint, at worst disgusting." Really? In whose misandrist manifesto? The concept "Western Man" is, after all, just that - a concept. There is no such unified and homogeneous group and no such "specter" has haunted it for so long. That men should cringe at the word castration is less a mystery than than why women should fear rape. In short, Taylor's analysis of the history and purposes of castration sheds less light on the "cultural construct of masculinity" than on the sadistic sexual abuse and humiliation with which males can be threatened and subjugated. That some of his readers find him witty or funny at times is only because Taylor's treatment of his subject is often sophmoric.    In my view, today's attitudes toward manhood and males are best understood in terms of our lacking moral sympathies toward them. Taylor's book is no exception. We are not a generation influenced by Freud so much as by feminism. Thus, the historical abuse and mutilation of women is a subject deadly serious and pertinent to us while the sexual abuse and humiliation of men is treated like something that never happened - that is, something we've misconstured, or, in Tayor's case, given a fictional reinterpretation, mocked and trivalized. Taylor's ignorant belief (not first person, of course) about the sexual prowess of eunuchs is one case in point. Another case in point is Tayor's view that for most of western history castration was a mark of power and divinity and, as the ultimate abrogation of sexual desire, had wide spread currency among Christian metaphysicians. This is nonsense. Taylor is arguing anecdotally to his own foregone conclusions. He wasn't there to take any polls. No doubt, some Christian cults managed to appropriate practices of sexual mutilation already in place - just as Christian nihilism helped to make slavery seem worthy. This did not, however, make such practices any more agreeable as hardly anyone wanted to suffer either condition  themselves. In any case, the spiritualized feelings attained by some Christian monks through self mutilation would have appalled the Greeks - the paragons of western civilization - as it has most men throughout all of human history.   Taylor's book about castration will score a few points for the concept of cultural relativism on a subject that now seems, at best,  uncontroversial or, at worst, comic to the immature. Should he chose to write volumes exploring the gamut of humanity's attitudes regarding every other form of sexual nastiness, he will no doubt find endless tolerance to be feted as well. Would he dare? 
 he should become a leftwing dem.  id like to show up at his door to sell him something.  what a gull.  hes now prolly the leading special interest flak for islam.  i consider him an enemy of america.  why hasnt he come out w. a post 911 book.  i call him paul fiddley.  hes quite a fiddler.  as gullible as lincoln steffens visiting the soviet union.  a mental lightweight w. only a ba degree.  presbyterian background.  they think they are the chosen ones & can run circles around jews.  makes no mention of slavery in the current lands of isla 
 This is a book by another "specialist" on the Middle East that would appeal to the common denominator reader. In an attempt to cover a wide scope of countries and issues and histories, Roger Owen, a well-respected authority in the subject matter, churns out a shallow text that does not even start getting to the issues at hand. It is a dull read that follows a standard template for what a professor believes should be fed to undergraduate students.  Professor Owen dwells in 280 pages on state building and political parties and movements, but lacks insight into events at the beginning of the 20th century that contradict his conclusions. I would not recommend this book for serious readers of Middle East issues or history, but it is useful for those under duress to produce a term paper at college.   
 I have read a few of these reviews and what I noticed is that mostly STUDENTS are having a problem in understanding. This book maybe good for professors but it's not clear in deleivering the concepts to the students! 3rd EDITION?! The author needs to let students give feedback. When I used this book we NEVER WENT IN ORDER of the chapters. We always skipped around... if it's so good, why must we always reference other materials 
 At 23, I don't have "age" wrinkles around my eyes, but I have laugh lines that I want to soften. This product has done nothing for my laugh lines. I could have spent the same amount of money on something else that works. Skin growth factors available on ebay helped rebuild the skin in the creases of my laugh lines. This product did not.  
 I honestly don't believe this is a piece of rubbish. Not at all. Well... maybe 
 I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.    The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly 
 I was actually disappointed with this book. I judged the book by the cover and I liked the overall appeal of the cover and the headlines, but as I read it went into so much detail that I would forget what I was reading. It took me about a good month to finish it but it wasnt worth reading 500-600 pages... lost count. But it was not worth waiting getting to the 30th chapter to wrap it up and get to the point. For me, there wasnt much suspense. Overall it kept me occupied and now I'm starting a new book 
 4 screenwriters came up with such bad screenplay? what kind age range disney targeted this time? teenage over 11 years old didn't like it, parental adults had to bite the bullet to co-watch it with their children, from age 6 to 10, maybe? or this was just for the purpose to sell more sound tracks of this childish movie? 
 This was the required book for the Databases class at the University of Utah Computer Science department. It is a good book if you want to learn the theory behind databases. If you want to actually learn about practical information then pickup "The Practical SQL Handbook" by Bowman and others.  Also note that the E-R diagrams Silberschatz uses is not widely used. I found the book to be poorly written. Buy this book only if you need it for school 
 Well of course I read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey-market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a US version... wrong!  I just received mine today and it's got the international warranty card and users manual. I haven't decided if I'm going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey-market version of this unit 
 I picked up this book for two reasons. First, the main character, Cyn, was in the advertising business. Second, I thought the premise sounded interesting. Cyn takes over another women's identity, who has wronged her in the past. I was pretty disappointed on both fronts. The whole advertising business aspect wasn't very realistic, even for a chick-lit book. As far as the plotline goes, the author tried way too hard to make Cyn likable. I ended up hating her because she was so gosh darn nice. The whole identity-stealing sounded great, but came out pretty lame as well. A below par fluffy read 
 SIMPLY PUT, WORDS FAIL ME AS I STRIVE TO PURVEY THE SENSE OF FLOW I GET FROM THIS BOOK; AKIND TO MOLASSES IN THE WINTER.A BIT MORE HEAT TO THE MIX WOULD HAVE WET MY PALATE FOR THIS MUDANE LITERARY EXPERIENC 
 Simply put, this book is a tedious, crashing bore.  It might do as an example of how NOT to write a book, but there is really no redeeming value otherwise.      The greatest problem with the work is the "nested" narratives, as one reviewer refers to them, that comprise the book.  First, a shipwrecked ex-monk begins to tell Melmoth's descendent his (long, tedious, uninteresting) story. Then, fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition and hiding in an underground series of caverns, he begins to translate a book. The narrative then shifts to said book, where we begin the "Tale of The Indians". In the middle (more or less) of this tale the narrative shifts once again to Melmoth The Wanderer himself who tells the story of "The Guzman Family" and "The lovers' tale". Finally, the "Tale of the Indians" reaches its conclusion after these drawn-out interruptions. Subsequently-you guessed it-the narrative shifts again (it's not clear at this point if it's back to the book (which is never mentioned again) or to the narrative of the ex-monk.  Then, we have a sort of anticlimactic conclusion. The great problem in all these narratives is that the authorial voice NEVER CHANGES, not one scintilla. It's still Marturin telling the tale, without even an attempt to alter the style or voice of the telling to the series of changing raconteurs.       Marturin supposedly started this work as an extension of a sermon he preached. I think that is the only way to understand it or appreciate it, (if you're given to such things) as an anti-Catholic, anti-free-thinking screed against all who aren't devout (non-Catholic) Christians.  If you truly believe in the Lake of Fire and the damnation of souls for pursuing knowledge.- Instead of seated on a prayer stool, where one obviously ought to be-this is the book for you.-Heretics need not apply---Otherwise, for the sane reader, a colossal waste of time and attention.    Let me aver here (and commend to same sane reader) that the truly great and classic novel of this sort is James Hogg's Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner: A truly eerie account of religious obsession, with profound and haunting psychological/spiritual insight, that will leave even the most modern reader chilled and thoughtful 
 Martha, Martha, Martha!  I thought you were on par with your brother, but I guess I was mistaken!  I am fascinated and enamored with Rufus and his repertoire, so naturally, I was willing to give Martha a good "college try".  Well, I found this music to be boring and the lyrics just not "there".  This one's going to Goodwill.  There is MAYBE one song that I would listen to again, that might grow on me over time and make it into my "rotation".  But Rufus has something indescribable, for me, that Martha just "ain't got".  I think she should stick to being backup for her brother, as their voices blend beautifully.  Martha, hat's off to you for trying to find your own voice, but you should cede the crown to your brother 
 to be real its not a cd worth buying out the store. the beats are to watered down for a real thug. "real talk from a real listener of hardcore rap. 
 Sontag represents a certain type of "intellectual" who is - thankfully - becoming increasingly rare in the world of google and broadband. As exemplified by Descartes (I think, therefore I am), this is the school of people who think that truth can be discovered solely through rumination - without doing any research, without experimentation, without any investigation of the world outside of your skull. It is pure subjectivity - gloriously self-referential and egotistic, completely self-contained and titannically self-satisfied. What Sontag's writings are about are Sontag - not the world as it is (and which can easily be fact checked) but the world as seen through the coke bottle lens of Sontag's ego and self. Sontag would hate the comparison but she is the leftist equivalent of the medieval christian mystic - the world outside of her own mind doesn't matter and facts have no weight. This is what enabled her - in one of the most egregious public acts of heartlessness in the last one hundred years - to praise the 9/11 terrorists for bravery while the World Trade Center was still smoldering and bodies were still being dragged from the debris. This was like praising the Nazi concentration camp managers for efficiency and thoroughness. Having distanced herself from humanity and decency with her warped and unbalanced intellect, the stunned response to her statements probably bewildered her completely. No matter as her crazed statements had plenty of precedents in her previous writings. She took the very cheap, easy, and elitist high road of condemning every wrong in the world - without ever offering any solutions and always, always, condemning the USA for actually trying to do something about these problems rather than just word process away safely in her study surrounded by the works of Verlaine, Rimbaud, and Genet.  In Photography, Sontag is at the Acme of her (witch) craft. She thinks (and enough critics seemed to have agreed with her) that a well written sentence implies veracity as if the good sentence was a litmus test for truth; as if grammar and a good thesaurus conferred reliability, sanity, or common sense. It doesn't. She'll be forgotten. I think she would have appreciated that - joining the obscure writers that few people read, enjoyed, or valued. She was too elitist to have enjoyed it very much if she actually was embraced by the masses 
 Gates has missed the cluetrain.  Microsoft is still engaging in the us against them corporate mentality, and this book reveals why.  He's so focussed on the boardroom mentality that he seems to have no clue what his CUSTOMERS want.  It's all about how the internet can serve the company, rather than how the company can fill the needs of the community 
 Santayana has a flowing style and is a master of rhetoric.  Do not read  this work if you are looking for a well argued thesis.  He lets points  stand on sweeping generalizations that will only be accepted by those  already in agreement.  Santayana's critiques of religion rest upon  sociology rather than philosophy, and his appreciation of religion is  limited and patronizing 
 The only reason why I think this "movie" continues to actually exist is the fact that the luscious & amazingly gorgeous Elizabeth Hurley does topless nudity in the film.  Other than that asset, this film is absolutely abysmal.  Atrocious acting, hackneyed script, ham fisted direction and terrible lighting.  It's not even good in a so-bad-it's-good type of way.  Avoid at all costs and just download the Elizabeth Hurley nudity off of the internet 
 If the demented 13-year-old offspring of the unholy union between David Lynch and William S. Burroughs were given pen and paper and told to write a trippy story splattered (and I don't choose that word lightly) with blood, gore, zombies and sex, Baby Jesus Butt Plug is what you'd get.  Unfortunately the outcome will still suffer from the story telling of a hormone laden 13-year-old boy.  To illustrate, imagine a depraved pre-pube making up a wild sex-fi story on the fly, while his wide-eyed buddies eat up his every absurd word.  It's stream-of-consciousness story telling with all manner of shock and awe thrown in for effect.  On the other hand, the beginning and end of the story contain flashes of satirical brilliance, biting humor and quirky sci-fi-esque fun to offset the crude writing and story line.  One passage that I found particularly clever and amusing is when the narrator talks of getting a free Baby Jesus Butt Plug from a couple who just want to make sure the BJBP goes to a good home.  He says, "And when they said `a good home' all they really meant was they didn't want to give them to anyone who would stick them in their butts".  I wish Mellick had pursued the socio-religious angle of owning a BJBP that began to take form in the first third of the book.  Or he could have explored the conundrum of losing oneself physically and mentally in a sea of one's own clones.  Either way would have made for a much more powerful and coherent statement.  As it stands, the story begins to provoke and stimulate but quickly deteriorates into a menage-a-bizarre story of teen male angst, desire and fear.  I've read other Mellick works and know that in a lengthier format he can make you blush, throw-up and ponder in the matter of one short paragraph.  So I am comfortable in saying that this is not his best.  However, if you want a unique insight into the stuff of which adolescent boys wet dreams are made, then Baby Jesus Butt Plug will take you there. 
 I've enjoyed other works by this artist, so I purchased "Christmas and Sante Fe" without listening to it first.  What a mistake.  It's what I call motivational music.  It makes me want to do something else 
 For the price ($80) I expected much better sound.  Should spend a little more and get a Shoenhut or for $10 you could get a toy piano that sounds better than this one.  Very tinny sound, completely out of tune (why do they bother even assigning a note to the keys?), and lid is attached with screws AND glue so the only way to get to the metal rods to attempt to tune it, even after the screws are removed, will be to crack the wood casing getting past the glue 
 There's a regressively narrow perspective signalled through the use of the outdated trope of the "dandy." The dandy is a figure so cut off from community and place that it Romantically spirals away into never-never land. By using a gender framework, the argument seems more realistically grounded than it is 
 This was the WORST rendition of Rumi poetry reading I have ever suffered through-it was painful to listen to what sounded like a Native American Hick read in a monotone unemotional manner this beautiful poetry.   I even shared it with three other very enlightened spiritual people because I thought it might just be my personal opinion, but they asked me to turn it off!  It was Like drinking sour milk 
 Kabbalah includes various types differentiated by spelling.  "Kabbalah" is used generically including all of the types but specifically it means ancient and/or medieval Jewish mysticism (i.e. esoteric Kabbalah) including the work of creation (e.g. Sefer Yetzirah=Book of Formation, mistranslated as Creation) & the work of the Chariot or Merkavah (e.g. Hekalot=Palaces literature).  Main books are Zohar (Book of Splendor), Bahir (Book of Brightness), Yetzirah, Hekalot & Shi'ur Koma (symbolic descriptions of God's "physical" dimensions).  Ecstatic Kabbalah (e.g. Abraham Abulafia) employs meditations on permutations of God's names.  Christian Cabala is frequently Christian apologetic, & Practical Qabalah concerns magic & occult or theurgy.  This work is one of Qabalah--addressing angelology, astrology, magic (e.g. talismen), alchemy, numerology, & mythology.  Not surprisingly, the translator owns an occult bookstore & that much of the bibliography is occult-oriented.  The book is more grimoire (magical text) than most popular (usually elementary) Kabbalah books.  It is very different from the Kabbalah classics above.  While some of them are difficult, symbolic, esoteric, etc. they feel that there's something deep & symbolic even if you can't figure it out.  IMHO this book doesn't; it feels channeled or, perhaps, automatic writing.  Many Kabbalistic books are pseudoepigraphic, their stated authors are not their real authors but an attempt to lend credence, authenticity, & authority to the text.  Often they are attributed to ancient masters (e.g. Sepher Yetzirah, Zohar); this text is no exception--legend states that it was given by Reziel to Adam.  It was published in 1701 & probably written not much earlier IMHO--not by Eliezer of Worms or Isaac the Blind.  Orthodox Jews would hardly say, p. 198: "Change the Sabbath of the Jews".  The work itself says it was written by p. 226: "Levi ben Zosekien" & refers to pp. 243/273: "David ben Zelateh"  The translation is greatly flawed.  It has a Cabala bias: "Old Testament" is pejorative; it has extensive description of Hell like Dante's Inferno; it even refers to drinking a glass of rum!  It's shows extensive ignorance of Jewish tradition/languaging: wrong definitions of Midrash, the tallit dye, Merkabah (refers to Ezekial's vision), p. 45 tzithzith (tallit fringes), & confuses rabbi with high priest.  Languaging errors include common & unusual ones: adds final h's on words; p. 19: has I for yod vs. Y, has vau for vav; has Ahiea for Ehyeh (the stated Biblical name of God is Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh="I am that I am"--kind of important!).  Finally, the numbered names of God are dissimilar to ones I've seen--his name of 72 is a set of trigrams reminiscent of the I Ching, lists of angels seem inconsistent, & the book has a staccato or hodgepodge feel to it.  The most interesting line in it for me was: p. 227 "The king of goodness & wickedness" which implies that God has both--per the Tree of Life.  This book is a magical curiosity of interest to esoteric Kabbalists from an historical perspective but mostly of interest to Qabalists--Savedow wisely uses this spelling in his book 
 I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad. 
 The maps in this book are completely inadequate.  Barcelona is a big complicated city and needs more than Powerpoint-style graphics that pass for maps.  Reading a flimsy Spanish map from the tourist office was better.  Pictures... virtually non-existent.  Construction of book absolutely pales in comparison to a Lonely Planet book.  Poor layout.  I do not work for Lonely Planet 
 I have read every one of Stephen King's books.  This was the only one that I have not read.  I have struggled to get to page 105 and I have no clue as to what is going one.  The style of Peter Straub stinks.  Don't waste your money, you will put this book back on the shelf an never have a clue as to what the story is about.  Stephen King has finally written a real clunker.  This may be the worst book that I have ever tried to read 
 I have always been intrigued by the Arthurian legends and thought that as a woman, I'd enjoy this book.  Boy was I wrong!  Guenevere was a whiny, self-centered woman, whom I would be ashamed to know.  And I was sorely disappointed at the way the Catholic faith was misrepresented as a male-dominated cult 
 This book does not compare with 1) Atlas Shrugged, or 2) The Fountainhead.  In my opinion, those are two of the finest books ever written.  If you haven't read them, put We the Living aside and read them now.  I could not finish We the Living.  I got sick of the stupid relationship.  I guess I got about 1/4th the way through.  Maybe my tastes are changing 
 I already have a good quality FitBall stability ball that I really like and only bought this set to get the DVD. I had planned to give the ball to a family member, but unfortunately it is of poor quality and not burst resistant, so it will probably just get thrown out.  The included pump is a piece of junk, so even if you do want to use the low quality ball, you'll need to find another way to inflate it.  Finally, Mindy Mylrea is a good instructor, but the music & sound quality were lacking and I ended up not liking the workout, so in the end I got rid of the dvd as well. 
 Oh well, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes the bear gets you. Reading the classics can be boring as this classic illustrates. Goldsmith should have kept to poetry and left the novel alone else he would not have produced this mess in the form of a philosophical romance, a loosely constructed story held together by ideas. Rasselas (Johnson) and Candide (Voltaire) are much better and worth a look. Meanwhile why bother with a story wherein the hero moves episodically from security through trials to the discovery that happiness and what truths we may grasp lie at home and in the human breast. The ideas are quaint and silly. The writing stylized and artificial. The characters impossible. The plot preposterous. You have better things to do with your time - like sleep 
 This is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to read: academic writing style, feeble plot, very forced. There is no humour or humanity in this book. A complete waste of a good tree 
 I should have listened to the other reviewers...  I wanted to replace my C: drive with a faster one, and Ghost 10.0 says it can do it, but don't be fooled.  Even if you follow the extra steps from their support site (which are not in the documentation), you will end up with an unusable copy that will boot up but then fail with assorted catastrophic errors.  It will also give you occasional error messages that are neither in the documentation nor on their support site.  A friend recommended Acronis TrueImage which I ended using instead.  It's much easier to use, copies about 2x faster than Ghost, and best of all it works.  I cloned and replaced C drives from two laptops in a couple of hours with no problems.  
 I give this CD one star, not because it isn't good, but, because it is the same stuff they have already sold once. I am a big Blind Melon fan. I was fortunate to see them live 3 times and they were great, but, when you can download songs like Mother Earth, Whoa God, Tickled Pink, and Rebirth. I have to wonder why they would release an album that is all old stuff. The only people interested in this album would be melon fans. Evident by how poorly Nico did in sales, This is very disappointing, it seems they are broke and are trying to rip the true fans off. There is nothing new, so do yourself a favor and just bust out your old CD's and play them, don't buy this, unless you don't own the albums.  The surviving members should be ashamed of themselves 
 Or maybe "Weekend with Jesus and the Girls". I get very frustrated when authors don't tell you up front that a book that sounds as if it is for every woman is actually full of religious messages. My girlfriends and I would no sooner pray over each other than eat "cheese and crackers" on "hoity toity night" or pack fake doggie doo or a whoopee cushion for laughs!   It doesn't take all of the psychological manipulation of your sisters that they describe in this book to create strong female bonds. The truth comes naturally and doesn't require scheduled sessions of prayer, nor does it require scripted questions that are meant to break someones spirit and build an artificial need for the group. Plan your own weekend... and just have fun 
 I purchased this for my 11 year old son.  I am so thankful that I read this book before giving it to him or going straight to discussing it.  The pictures are hand drawn but graphic.  Far too much detail for the target audience. Kids need to know about sexuality but they don't need to know EVERYTHING before they are even teen-agers.  I would be upset to find this in a school library.  This book definitely needs to be used with supervision. I returned this book as I believe its content is inappropriate for the cover advertised age of 10 years old. 
 I was disappointed in this book.  I had started getting these books on CD from the library amd thoroughly enjoyed the first few I listened to.  I enjoy the author's picturesque, almost poetic, descriptions of things.  Those descriptions were still there, but they did not connect well.  The mystery of the person murdered becomes an incidental by-line, not really crucial to the other goings-on in the story.  There is no expanation to why the return of the turkeys is of any significance and what do the cats' being able to communicate with them have to do with anything in the story line.  I felt very let down at the end of this audio book 
 With the $70-million that was spent on the 2005 video-game-inspired film "Doom", you'd think that director Andrzej Bartkowiak would have used better lighting so that the audience could actually see what was going on more clearly.  On second thought, given that this predictable film was little more than 100 minutes of "shoot the mutants", it's pretty clear that Mr. Bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment.  As to the film's plot, it can be summarized in a single sentence:  a group of ï¿½ber-soldiers lead by their "Sarge" (played by The Rock) travel to Mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh-eating mutants after injecting a criminal with DNA recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a Martian archaeological dig.  So, there's tons of shooting, a lot of screams, gallons of fake blood & guts being tossed about, a Martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small-scale version of "The Sphere".  Others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include Karl Urban (ï¿½ber-soldier John Grimm) and Rosamund Pike (as John Grimm's sister named Sam).  Why these two actors would stoop so low as to participate in "Doom" defies logic.  To anyone who actually paid good money to watch this 1-star film in a theater, you have my deepest sympathy.  To anyone thinking of purchasing a copy of "Doom" on DVD, please notice that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap price.  That alone should tell you how "good" this film is 
 Not the original "Classic" Jungle Book!  This is a ripped off version of the one we loved as children.  Sure you can get it for $5, but it is so not worth it.  I tried to return the unopened dvd, but to no avail, they would not offer a refund 
 Sure, this movie is a classic. But is it any good? Frankly, I found it to be tedious in the extreme.  It's certainly pleasant to look at. The sets are quite amazing, and the cinematography is absolutely beautiful.  The story (as described in detail in many other reviews here) has potential as both a thriller and a thought-provoking essay (ultimately it is neither).  The acting is top notch, as are all of the special effects. Those of us who cut our teeth using teletype machines always get a kick out of seeing them in all their anachronistic glory. In fact, all of the computer stuff is believable for the era and pleasantly nostalgic.  But the whole thing never rises to its premise. Its "thriller" aspect is artificial and not tied to the central plot line, and entirely predictable from the moment our friend is handed THE ONLY KEY THAT CAN STOP THE NUKE! The resolution is an afterthought (a quick fix in the extreme), and barely even mentioned in about two lines of dialogue after the artificial danger is (narrowly, whew!) averted. The characters are thin at best, and stock at worst.  This movie is really a slow survey of what people in the early 70s thought technology would be like in the mid 70s. Yawn. (I must laugh at the whole bell/paper bit. It means nothing to the plot, and is the ultimate contrivance.)  If a deadly virus actually came back from space, there would certainly be action on many fronts, with plenty of interesting conflict to go around. Some people would try to understand it, others would want only to kill it. There's some potentially interesting tension right there. Some people would argue to keep the danger hidden from the public, others would want to warn them. Again, that could have been a good source of tension. Someone would surely have suspected that the military wanted to harness it as a biological weapon (mentioned in passing, but never developed), while others would try very hard to prevent that. More tension.  I'm just saying that this movie is littered with missed opportunities for something more than the collection of boring experiments and pointlessly slow-moving scenes which it actually contains. This movie is the poster child for boring science fiction, and it would not have had to be that way.  I haven't read the book, but I bet it's a lot better. At its core, this movie is a boring dud.   
 Just finished reading this novel this morning and I think it is probably the weakest one of the lot.  Like a lot of reviewers, I didn't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well-developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the Stephanie Plum series.  As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date.  It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie's romantic situation once and for all.  I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me.  There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive.  I still think there is a spark of life in the Stephanie Plum series, but I hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by-the-numbers as this one 
 Big budget, but big on "stoopid" as well. The cast had some great potential, but the film flops on the tedious, tantrum filmed performance of its lead: Elizabeth Berkley.  Nomi leaves a bad life, moving to Las Vegas in search of a better one in the bright lights. She meets Molly, who takes her in, and eventually finds herself working at the Cheetah, doing lap dances while looking for her big break at one of the more upscale clubs. She gets her chance when Cristol Conners (Gershon), current Diva of the stage at the Stardust, buys her beau, Zack Carey (MacLachlan), the Stardust's Entertainment Manager, a lapdance from Nomi. While fending off the lesbian advances of Conners, Nomi manages to score big: she bags the role of Conners' understudy, snatches Conners' man Zach, and eventually dumps Conners down a flight of stairs in order to get herself into the spotlight.  Elizabeth Berkley is a Cinderella who behaves more like one of the wicked step-sisters. Her interaction with others is either wild-eyed temper tantrum, or sweet little innocent, oftentimes within the same scene. Take some Prozac, sister! The amount of time the other more substantial leads spend pursuing her in the face of her abuse, tantums and such makes the whole film less than credible.  Everyone spends alot of time nude in the film. Berkley shows all of her openings, gratuitiously, and her inane love scenes with MacLachlan (who shows quite a bit of backside) are more funny than erotic. There is NOTHING erotic about this film, though Gershon does show a vampishly stylish performance. Robert Davi, as owner of the Cheetah, is sleazily charming, as is Lin Tucci, the bawdy big lady who provides comic relief during the shows. MacLachlan... well, he's never been one of my favorite actors, neither for looks or talent, but he does have a fine ass, and shows quite a bit of it in the film 
 This book was assigned to me as college reading and all I can say is that I am offended with the language and feel verbally abused by the content. The author is abusing the audience. I have friends whom are gay and they never talk like the trash that represnt them in this book, they hold themselves to a higher level and have class. The author creates gay hatred instead of encouraging people to embrace the gay culture. This book makes you think gays have no sense and that they are wierd instead of just average people. I believe the author has hurt the gay community more then he has helped.  
 Based on her own definition in this book, Ms. Coulter is liberal to the core. "If you cannot articulate your opponent's position, you are not an adult; you are a liberal."   Ms. Coulter is an articulate author with an admirable command of language. Her twists of the literary knife  are a pleasure to read, even when you realize that she has severed your necktie. Or your intestine. She has a penchant for making the same point three or five or six times using eight or twelve or twenty examples, which is about as pleasant as watching a pile driver hammer a steel rod into granite.  Her thesis is that the political opinions of mainstream American media are more liberal than those of mainstream America, affecting both the choice and treatment of news topics. She raises some cogent and disturbing points. Her opening  line, "Political debate in this country is insufferable," makes clear that she can and does address fundamental problems that transcend the issues of the moment.  She also identifies the cause of these problems in her first paragraph: "It's all liberal's fault." She judges the value of any action entirely by the political stance of the actor, regardless of the action itself. Liberals who characterize conservatives as "dumb" (i.e. every liberal, everywhere) are attacking their opponents personal traits because they are unable to create or express any meaningful arguments. She does not apply the same logic to her own statement such as "All liberals hate America," or "Liberals love pedophiles." She is certainly skilled in logic, as revealed in a hair-splitting analysis of why it is reprehensible for liberals to describe right wing ideas as "Nazi" in nature, but Rush Limbaugh's term "femin-Nazi" is a discerning and accurate characterization.  
 As other reviewers have been, I'm also unhappy with the removal of central plot elements, especially Mrs. Cheveley's broach.  The effect of removing this element is that it is Chiltern who saves Goring, not Goring who saves Chiltern, and the play therefore never gives Goring his moment of heroism and nobility.  This film  is too jolly and innocent.  Laura Cheveley's hubris, Robert Chiltern's anguish, these are really side shows in the film which focuses more on Goring, his wit, and his pre-marital uncertainty.  I do think the film is entertaining, for what it is worth.  Anyone who has an interest in romantic comedy or a very casual interest in Wilde will probably enjoy it.  If you know this play and Oscar Wilde well, though, you may be frustrated 
 My child is 2 1/2 years old .  She watched about 10 minutes into the movie and appeared to be quite frightened by some of the images.  The story line appeared to be sensible but not one that a toddler will understand.  At the end of the day I do not think the point of the story is what she remembers as much as she will remember the scarry pirate. 
 In preparation for business school I thought I'd brush up on my stats.  But this book is making things even more confusing because of all the errors.  Graphs are misplaced, calculations are off, and equations are wrong in way too many places. I wonder how this was ever published with so many mistakes 
 First, I am a very open-minded person, raised by a hippy/Biker family.  I really expected to identify with this book.  While I appreciate the what Ina May's movement accomplished during its time, I felt like the book was almost a joke--verging more on detailing accounts of an occult community--A community of people living on old school buses in the woods, delivering each other's babies.  The language is terrible---everything is described as "psychedelic," etc--one woman even referred to her female parts using the big "p" word.  While they try to add a personal touch by including individual narrations, it sounds more like a compilation of uneducated people describing their birth stories the way they were pressured to believe---NOBODY mentions feeling pain during labor. Honestly, I feel that the pressure of the community was so intense they wouldn't have admitted to pain if they could.  Also, many of the accounts were extremely erotic---couple are encouraged to fondle one another during labor to keep connected and relaxed.  In some accounts, a couple would be making out, while a midwife would massage the birthing mother in her "laboring parts"--turning the woman on and keeping her relaxed.  Not my cup of tea.  I had so little respect for the lifestyle and the language of the people that I didn't get much out of the book 
 I am a chilled CD fan, but I found this to be the weakest CD in the series. Most of the tracks are slow and uninteresting. I had a hard time finding a single track that I liked. I am surprised that other reviewers rated it so highly; so I had to give my opinion, since I bought it on their recommendations. The only track I liked was the one with Nora Jones doing background, but it alone is not worth the price of the CD. For a much better compilation, check out Ultra Chilled 3, which has many great songs 
 I agree with a previous review that you get what you pay for.  But in the future I would highly recommend paying more once instead of having to replace this food in a few months or so.  We received this as a gift and from the outside it looked like an great choice!  I was very happy.  But we have had this package of food for about one week and I am already taping boxes with packaging tape to keep them together.  Little hands can pull apart the milk, juice and snack boxes in no time.  The cans of food are so small that they topple over easily in the play kitchen.  The pies, pizza, and such food are all actually hollow underneath.  There is no base to them.  They tell you 101 pieces but in our kit it counted 8 hotdogs (without buns), 12 individual french fries and the same on potato chips.  Not necessary especially since you also get two french fry packets in a french fry container and you get a hot dog in a bun separately.  Why would my child want four jalepenos too.  So much of this food is not they type of thing a small child would be familiar with.  Anyway, in my opinion spend the money on a smaller quantity of higher quality food or go online and find the "vintage" Fisher Price or Little Tikes food.  Now those are made to last and of good size for small hands.  
 I would like to see a how to book that shows how to draw real fighting woman and what they would look like not an over-inflated,weak, want to be Barbie. That couldn't get out of her own way, And The child like attitude and often porn remarks about how women were drawn in the comics as always. It was a reason why I dropped that magazine all together. Now what makes these geeks think that they can offer advice on how to draw 
 Not only is Diamonds Are Forever the worst Connery Bond film, it is probably only surpassed by Moonraker as the worst of all of the 007 movies made by EON films.  A story that is far too complicated for anyone to keep track of what is going on, and relying too much on the return of Sean Connery as Bond left the producters and director to create a parody of their own films.  After On Her Majesty's Secret Service did not give as good an initial return on their investment, evidently producers Saltzman and Broccoli decided to take a step back in the direction of You Only Live Twice and Thunderball, but even further back than those 2 films!  The result is a complete mess, with a Bond movie that would have probably suited Roger Moore quite nicely, but is a shame to see Sean Connery wasted on such drivel. The one saving grace of this, the 7th James Bond movie, is the pre-credit sequence where Bond is hunting for the head of SPECTRE, Blofeld, who is responsible for killing his wife Tracy in the previous film.  To sum it all up: Ernst Stavro Blofeld in drag.  Need I say more

 If you have read these in the paper you are no doubt aware that Family Circus is trite and vapid. But if you think that this book somehow contains the jems that you somehow missed, please don't be fooled. I picked this up at a friends house after asking myself "why would sombody buy this?". The answer is This is the most undesirable gift to ever grace a white elephant gift exchange. If you want to see everybody scramble to get rid of a gift, just throw this waste of paper in the mix, but please don't buy it yourself 
 I have had a Canon G2 since 2002. I used to use Viking 128 MB CF cards and had no problem. In October 2004, I bought one Viking CF512M 512MB CF card from Amazon. I did not use it until this summer. After I had taken 20 more photos and reviewed, I immediately found a few images corrupted. No matter how I tried, e.g. format the CF before use, there were alway corrupted images.  I wonder if I can return the defect CF card and get a replacement from Amazon or from manufacturer?  Sherwood  L.A. count 
 I have to say that I am a fan of Stephen King. After all I have read just about everything he has published over the years. Often his prose is easy to slip into. But here... here... King's plot is a mess. I think that this might have been created right at the end of his cocain period and his mind was like a TV that wont settle on any particular channel. At times the introspection of the characters is mesmerising, and you can find yourself caught up in 70 page jaunts dealing with arcane issues like poetry festivals or walks in the woods.   About half way through this massive book I started to feel that their was not really going to be a cohesive plot to this story. That this was going to be ramblings that were not pasted together. The characters were not very likeable, and it was hard to sympathise with them as they spiral downwards over the course of the book. King starts in on a wholey new story here and then proceeds to tie together three 'novelas'. Slowly the spaceship that is uncovered in the opening pages starts to take a grip over the entire small neighboring New England town.   I'm a pretty hard critic of King's even though I have spent so much time with his books. In my opinion, nine times out of ten he manages to miss the mark in some crucial aspect. Prior to reading Tommyknockers, the one book, or series, that was most trying for me to get through was the Gunslinger saga. I think that Tommyknockers was both better and far worse than this series. If I were you, and had yet to read much of Kings work, I would steer away from this one and try a classic like Salem's Lot or a few of his short stories 'Skelleton Crew'. King is probably best at the short story and if you have yet to read many of them, you are in for a treat 
 The screen version of the book is nothing like the book in any manner, except for the characters and the plot. The movie lacks that serious business and glamorous edge that the book brings out. The movie summarises the story and shreds it almost to pieces. The movie rushes through the story in mock-comedy fashion as if the whole shinding was an episode of a comedy series. The book is about the power, greed, bravado and glory that emanated from Wall Street in the roaring '80s and shook the entire financial and business world in that era - globally. The movie misses that point by light years. It's a childish and vindictive parody of a great story. It's also pretends to be a "Dummy's guide to LBO's in the 1980's" when characters explain the salient points of LBO's. I hope another director/producer team will give this another bash and bring to the screen a real powerful and moving story based on this book 
 Vickers just can't write!  He's fantastic in an archive and here has gathered an excellent array of facts from numerous sources.  He has also done an excellent job of putting everything together.  But he just isn't at all a good writer.  His style is awkward and clumpsy - he doesn't know how to effectivel tell a story.  How he got as far as he did is a modern wonder.  AND the cause of the book, being in effect comissioned by Prince Philip, was also it's death, as it is extremely prejudiced in presenting only what the palace wants us to know and believe.  There are numerous unpleasant and controversial facts about the historical characters in the book which are neatly omitted, and Alice is always sympathetically and gallantly focused.  No even-handed critique or analysis here - just a nice Windsor-approved glowing tribute, and poorly written 
 This book is full of hate and racism on Kincaid's part. Would she have no tourists? What brings in the money?  She should be a part of the solution not continue the problem 
 Rest Stop is a pretty bad straight to DVD horror flick.  It's the same old "redneck rampage" style serial killer flick.  But the plot is just in shambles and doesn't make much sense.  Only about 20 minutes of this movie is worth seeing.  By the way, you know a movie is bad when Joey Lawrence is the best actor in it.  I'll give it this much... there are probably two very nasty/awesome gore scenes for the slasher fans out there 
 Book was written in ignorance... This book is based on an entirely false notion, of what MLM is.  It sterotypes this type of buisness and everyone in it to be the same.  It fails to understand that MLM is a business model,  that is neither good or bad, and an MLM businessman/woman can build this  build this business any number (100's) of ways 
 I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read 
 Worse album Evan has made to date - sad to say given how excited I was for this to be released!!  
 As a professional consultant, I thought I was the target market for this book. I mean, it does call itself "the ultimate", doesn't it?  Well... I was beyond disappointed. If you have ever marketed yourself or your business, if you have ever read a business book in your life, if you have even just managed to stay in business for more than a year, this book is far too basic for you.  According to the authors, the crux of personal marketing seems to be creating "personal postcards" and sending them to people anytime you can figure out an excuse to do it. There are a few other ideas that they beat to death, as well. While these ideas may be a good idea for some, there is just so much more that.   The book looks good, but the reality is that there are too few ideas, the ideas covered are outdated, and I thought the whole tone was pitched really low and patronising. It was a waste of money, but more than that, a total waste of time 
 While Ruth Haley Barton uses the right Christian terminology, the underlying practice of this book is Zen Meditation.  I would read this book with a great deal of caution.  
 I received this after my trip and was told I would be receiving a return authorization, but I have not received it 
 One Star is evidently the required minimun. This documentory, in my opinion, distorts the facts and does so for policical purpose and personal agenda.  If you are looking for the truth, you won't find it here.  There are people who, by exploiting the ignorance and stupidity of other Americans, spread mis-information for one or more reasons: for personal or political agenda, or both; and/or, in some cases, such action either aids or supports the enimes of our country. This is a prime example of the type of people who intelligent Americans consider Anti-American as evidenced by the nature of their words, acts, and reasoning. They have a right say their piece and present their documentary, regardless of their motive. CAUTION: Beware of those who intentionally spread misinformation as they have harmful ulterior motives! When a person, organization, or government wants to see America harmed and Americans dead, I, being an American, consider their comments as a serious threat to Americans, American interest and America's security. Americans who doen't consider such declorations as a threat are either stupid/ignorant people or my enemy; there is no third option.        
 The quality of the art covered in this book is highly uneven and many of the theories are terribly dated by today's standards. I get the impression that it was written more to promote the friends of the authors than to give an objective view of Feminist art. The Phaidon Press book from the Themes and Movements series, Art and Feminism, is MUCH better to the point that I am almost embarrassed to compare the two books.  There is a school of Feminist research that seems to equate technical accomplishment with patriarchy which conveniently allows mediocre art to seem quite important. Overall, the art in this book lacks guts, although some of it is good. Since it is no longer the only book of its type, get it only if you want to round off your collection. Otherwise, stick with the Phaidon Press book to which this one merely pales in comparrison 
 This was the first and last Iris Johansen book I will read. I thought oh I need something to do at work since its going to be slow today (I work in a library). So I broght it with me and it was so boring I actually fell asleep! I will not be finishing this book. It has no substance. I do not recommend it to anyone. It is a waste of time and money. Although if your looking to take a nap then go ahead and read it 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 Out of the whole 180 pages of the book, you're lucky if there's 10 pages SPECIFICALLY addressing oxy & prescription addiction verses addiction in general. even when you read it as a general addiction book - it's pretty superficial (main treatment suggestion is 12 step program)& not quite accurate - first chapter premise is that addiction only happens to people with genetic predisposition &/or "trauma" issues...how about the fact that some substances are highly addictive regardless of the other 
 All I can say about this CD is that I was so upset with the songs. Most of them got no interesting story to tell, unlike good songs that always do. I admit that he got a great voice, probably one of the most talented singers in the industry, but... If only he got better materials to record. He should learn something from his first album. 'Every light In The House' is still one among my all time favorits. Hope that he could get back on track ASA 
 Well, three German punks kidnap a rich guy (it doesn't really matter why).  Most of the dialogue consists of a leftist rhetoric that hasn't been heard since the 1960s.  There are lots of gloomy shots of the various characters brooding with vague looks on their faces.  Two of the kidnappers are male, one is female.  Of course there's a love triangle.  They drink quite a bit and smoke some pot.  Eventually they decide to let the guy go since they aren't the killing types.  There's a silly little twist at the end that is good for a laugh.   Find something else to do with your two hours, unless you want to practice listening to German. 
 Didn't read the reviews.  Shame on me.  Shame on Disney.  This is nothing more than a CD - there are many fine Disney CD's to pick from.  Stock must be really hurting that they have to bite the hand that feeds them 
 it added nothing to what any one knows about Strategic Thinking. all the usuall stuff: think in the futer, plan ahead,...I didn't like i 
 I'm more used to a more rhythmic tempo from ATB. This wasn't what I had in mind when I was buying the cd. All tracks are rather slow and melancholy. Not rapid up beat melodies and songs at all. It's good to relax with I guess. If you like a slow, more mesmerizing kind of tunes then this is for you. Otherwise don't bother. 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 My introduction to Borges was through the collection Labyrinths. I immediately fell in love with the stories, the prose, the poetry, and so went on to buy this complete volume. While it is nice to have all Borges's stories in one place, and at a reasonable price, the language doesn't really hold up for me. The translation is... well, not sloppy, but too simple, like those childrens' versions of classic novels they pressed on you in 5th grade. I have nothing against Andrew Hurley, but his translation of Borges leaves me cold. I'd give Borges 5 stars out of 5, but Hurley? No more than 2. 
 Good current trend analysis. Personal political bias reflected. Technical errors: Thinks methane is a fuel - it is not, Thinks is clean - actually causes more pollution to make than gasoline causes when burned.  No conclusions on trends, only vague thoughts and recommends positive thinking 
 John Katzenbach is an accomplished author and I had previously read and enjoyed another of his novels (The Analyst), so I was surprised at how bad The Shadow Man was.  The premise of the plot is that four very old Jewish people, survivors of the Holecaust, believe they have seen the "Shadow Man".  The Shadow Man was a Jew who joined forces with the Nazis to find Jews that were hiding to avoid certain doom in concentration camps.  These four old people feared the Shadow Man more than anything.  When one of them is killed, a retired police detective named Simon Winter looks into who the Shadow Man is.  Meanwhile, the Miami police are also investigating the death of the elderly Jewish woman and have young gangster as a suspect.  Eventually, Winter and the police and the District Attourney join to hunt the Shadow Man, a man of pure evil.  As the book villian, it was hard to fear a villian who was a killer 50 years ago but was now in his 70s.  Also, this book barely touches on WWII, yet purports at times to be a novel about WWII.  I've read a lot of great WWII novels, and this book would have been great if it had been set in the 60s.  But setting it present day with senior citizens and the main characters wasn't too exciting.  It wasn't exciting primarily because I wondered where had the Shadow Man been all these years?  Why was he starting to kill now?  The Shadow Man had no motivation to kill.  Finally, I realized I didn't like this book when I was skipping paragraphs at a time during the last 20 pages.  The entire book was like this with each character prone to long rambling inner thoughts that really added nothing to the story.  If you take away the WWII angle, this novel is bad.  The WWII angle adds some excitement, but there are probably thousands of books out there that relate the horror of WWII better than this one does.  The review from Publishers Weekly printed above summarizes my thoughts and deserves to be repeated..."Katzenbach (Just Cause) has some good Holocaust and WWII vignettes and pretty good cop-talk here, but the book is burdened by flat characterization, a slow pace, an odd, unsatisfying ending and a serious need for editing. 
 I was a little suspicious when I read all the amazing reviews.  I should have followed my hunch.  This book is mostly new age talk with no real advice (ie, "feel the blue and red flame of your inner love").  What am I supposed to do with that kind of advice?  If you're into that, good for you.  I'm gonna go look for some more practical advice 
 Like many folks who were born too late to catch televison's greatest shows when they first aired, but old enough to remember the pre-DVD era, I had previously only been familiar with the Twilight Zone through the magic of reruns and holiday marathons, and was thus unable to discern one season from another.   It's one of the greatest, most inventive shows of all time. I don't think many people would argue that. But someone's gotta say it - with a few notable exceptions, Season 3 is a real stinker.   First, there are an abundance of the 'silly' episodes - Twilight Zone fans will know the ones I'm talking about. You can usually tell from the soundtrack. Lighthearted, goofy episodes such as Season 3's "The Fugitive," "Once Upon a Time" (which gets an E for effort for featuring the brilliant Buster Keaton way past his prime), and "Showdown with Rance McGrew" are all pleasant enough, but not haunted with the same kind of masterful irony that the show is rightfully celebrated for.  Still, these whimsical diversions are absolute blockbusters compared to the myriad of dull, lifeless episodes here. If you can't figure out the 'twists' to episodes like "The Mirror," "the Jungle," "Quality of Mercy," "The Passersby," "One More Pallbearer," "The Little People," "Four O Clock" and "Young Man's Fancy" within the first three minutes, maybe the OC is more your speed. Even worse are the dunderheaded, offensively preachy episodes like "Deaths Head Revisited" and "Still Valley." No wonder you never see these in syndication - they stink. Then there are the flat out awful epsiodes, like "Little Girl Lost," which almost certainly inspired the movie Poltergeist, but is still laughably awful anyway.   There are some classics here - I'd count "It's A Good Life" and "To Serve Man" as some of the series's best - but they are in short supply, and chances are, if you're reading this, you're probably already quite familiar with these episodes.   File under: creatively bankrupt.     
 My roomate who is devoutly Catholic has this book and I decided to read it, because to be honest, if I read all history books that I would agree with, I would find that my world was very narrow and one-sided.  Let me first start with some of the positives.  1. The book did present an orthodox perspective on many historical events in the early church.  Some of these examples include the debate over the Trinity, Divinity of Christ Gnosticism and other controversies that were prevalent during this time period.  2. His research and work on Thomas Aquinas was excellent.  His examination of the early Scholastic movement was by far the best portion of this book.  3. He does criticize those in the church who abused their positions prior to and during the time of the Reformation.  However, this was brief and will lead into some later criticisms.  4. He does actively criticize liberal Catholics who would see the church morph into something that has no basis in the Scriptures or in Church history.    Despite, these positives, there are many aspects of this book which are historically inaccurate and present an idealized picture of Church history which reflects a tendency to show a one-sides view of the Catholic Church.  In this way, he moves away from being a historian and instead becomes an Catholic Apologist in the same vein as Karl Keating and others.  Criticisms (especially concerning the Protestant Reformation):  1. His utter dismissal of Eastern Orthodox and Protestant Churches as heretical.  On page 111, he describes eastern Christianity as being a "hotbed of heresy."  It would seem that all Christian faiths outside of Roman Catholicism are untrue and without merit    2. Protestants particularly are treated with disdain.  Luther in particular is vilified as a rebel.  He quotes selectively from Luther in order to paint him as a wild and irrational human being.  While Luther's later anti-semitism is well worth being criticized or condemned, Crocker goes too far in tying Luther to Hitler and the Holocaust.  Also, he does a disservice in creating a false portrait of Erasmus as a superior theologian to Luther.  3. Along the same lines, Calvin is given some credit as being the greatest Protestant theologian, but he is ultimately dismissed as creating the first "Christian Police State."  Now, Calvin again was a man who was imperfect, but his Geneva Republic which he called an "Aristocracy bordering on Democracy" was one of the first attempts since ancient times to create a system of checks and balances and representative government that had not been terribly evident in the Middle Ages.  In the American context, it might be interesting to note that Calvinism (in its distrust of human nature) was influential in helping the American Founders to create a system of checks and balances whereby we got our Executive, Legislative and Judicial Bodies.  Also, Crocker's comparision of Calvin's view of art to the ACLU was a cheap shot that could have been omitted.  With some of these thoughts in mind, I recommend reading this book to provide a one-sided view of history.  However, I would not read this as a detailed and non-partisan account of history.  A better book that is historically more sound and would seem to be non-partisan would be "The Protestant Reformation" by Diarmaid MacCulloch is a much more unbiased look at the Reformation.    
 Honestly, i think this album's not half as good as MOT.  as a matter of fact, it's worse than their 1990 release, 'step in the arena'.  it's just an okay album 
 Complete waste of time!  I am done reading Robin Cook books for now..The story line for this book is so stupid I am amazed Mr. Cooks editors even allowed it to be printed..I'm not sure about the hospitals where Robin lives or works at, but in the area where I live, if just one patient died there would be an immediate investigation, but here we have several patients die from unknown causes and the characters just move along like it's no big deal..The Wilsons even allow their daughter to be admitted!!!  Give me a break!!  Like I said..don't waste your time on this one!!  
 Watson and Crick pilfered the data of Rosalind Franklin (unbeknownst to her) and her data then led them to their ultimate discovery of the double-helix nature of DNA. Instead of acknowledging her with praise, Watson goes on to belittle her and cast her in dark tones without understanding the context in which she was working (ie, a woman working in male-dominated science n the 1950's) -- a classic case of reaction formation. Maybe a brilliant man but with poor insight into human relationships 
 Written from a kid whose family was too poor to pay tuition and had to get loans, no wonder she only has bad stuff to say. Bad book. Bad writer. She should be ashamed that a fine education was given to her and this is what she did with it. The story is stupid and totally made up. Too bad the popular girls are still laughing at her 
 This book is just like watching the evening news you get lots of jingoism, and little in the way of factual documentation. Barkun's chapter on Black Helicopters for instance takes the most extreme views such as linking cattle mutilations to black helicopters and does nothing to address the topic of UN Military units operating domestically within the USA. Black Helicopters operating out of Fort Hood Texas are real, yet Barkun never bothers to tell his readers that Black Helicopters operated by the UN are real, and have even been involved in law enforcement activities here in the US. Shame on Mr. Barkun for his highly distorted take on historical events and people such as the Rockerfellers, the Council on Foreign Relations (which publically states they wish to destroy the US Constitutional Government and replace it with a UN Style world Government). If you want the truth listen to Alex Jones.. 
 I don't want to review this movie.  I just want to know if this DVD is REALLY $114.00 and who would pay that for that particular movie?  Are you sure someone didn't confuse the price with the run time which just happens to be 114 minutes?  I've seen this movie and it's okay, but definitely not worth $1.00 per minute.  Unless, of course, it comes with some of the booty from the tomb!  ;o 
 This video left much to be desired. The dvd was cheaply made. I urge you NOT to buy this video!! This is $20 thrown out the window. This video was filmed in someones house. I would never buy this if I knew!! 
 This book and it's author's logic is flawed beyond belief !  The fact that some Historians might differ on what exactly took place inside a concentration camp is not the same thing as "denying" there was such a thing as a concentration camp. Well, it is the same thing in the mind of this author !  Asking for proof and evidence for some of the wild claims as to what actually  happened constitutes "Holocaust Denial" - in the mind of this author !  Dicussing what phisically could have happened based upon the exact science of modern forensic technology constitutes "Holocaust Denial" - in the mind of this author !  However, she goes even beyond illogic, and into the world of "make believe" with her wild claims when it comes to noted British Historian David Irving - whome she rashly bashes and libels as a "Holocaust Denier".  The problem with that reckless defamation is that David Irving has NEVER, EVER, written ANYTHING on the "Holocaust" in any of his many books on World War Two subjects.  This deliberate misrepresentation alone should consign this book to the trash heap - which sentiment a great number of others agree with considering how many are offered on Amazon Marketplace starting as low as four bucks.  For a much better look at the real meaning of the "Holocaust" in modern times, read THE HOLOCAUST INDUSTRY by Norman Finkelstein, a truly righteous Jew whose parents were both incarcerated in concentration camps in World War Two 
 Got to be the toughest piece of leather a cow has ever produced!  I've literally never had a pair of boots that need THIS much breaking in and I own LOTS of boots.  Makes me not even want to to wear them 
 Moen's book recounts an intriguing series of personal journeys undertaken during classes at the Monroe Institute (TMI). The classes there build on experiences by its founder Robert Monroe detailed a series of books written over a span of many years. In a sense the Moen chronicle (this is vol 3) picks up where Monroe leaves off using the same kind of annoying jargon. Fortunately there is a glossary to guide the reader. Many other authors have tried to capture the goings-on at Monroe, but Moen seems to have turned it into a career. If you are a current or prospective TMI student, these writings could be the ultimate guide (or puff-piece) to bring a new level of understanding. However, if you are the average reader thinking from the title that you are going to learn something more about the afterlife as depicted by books in the spiritualist tradition, forget it. Science fiction fans would probably find great enjoyment with the work. Moen is an effective writer who maintains a fast-paced description of his experiences, but the jargon-laden pages are a bit much to attract attention from a general audience. His fun-filled episodes with their never-ending sexual overtones are more reminiscent of a teen-ager at Disneyland than a metaphysical explorer pushing to new levels of understanding. The volume is a testament to Moen's amazing astral abilities and his mentoring of TMI students. If you would like a description that is an order of magnitude more useful try the "Life in the world Unseen" series from Anthony Borgia or free afterlife ebooks at spiritwritings.co 
 I bought this product because I thought Norton was a quality product. Man did I make a mistake buying this product. I only had it on my computer for 1 month and it made my computer crawl , almost to where it would not  hardly work. I deleted it . Then my computer starting working just fine. This happened to me 2 times before I got tired of it and trashed it. 
 We rushed out and bought this new version. I don't think it's a computer, but she's almost that bad! For a great unabridged read try the 1991 Dercum Audio edition read by William Barker who adapts the character voices adroitly, showing an uncanny ear for the British aristocrats. Although not the latest high tech I for one will stick to the best 
 Mr Wong is making a good living selling his book and working the lecture circut.  Some good ideas but a lot of impractical stuff included.  The reality of the classroom and the ineffectiveness of school administration make working under such ideal circumstances unrealistic.  Work in 5 classes of 40-50 kids each day who can't read (many are moved up so they can be with their friends) and such touchy feely programs quickly fall aside.  
 LeRoy Ladurie's original study (in French) based on inquisitorial records, while marred by numerous mistranslations, misunderstandings and misuse of the sources, nevertheless, had a somewhat magisterial quality about it. It  is charming and well-written. In the hands of an expert, aware of its  limitations, Montaillou has some value; to the layperson: beware. The  translation, moreover, is truly bizzare. Part I is translated fully; Part  II severly abridged. There was no rhyme or reason for this. It is far  better to read the French original. If you're a novice or don't read  French, avoid this book 
 While the other reviewer of this DVD felt that there was a 'world of knowledge' contained in this disc is a matter of conjecture.  As an above average guitar player (blues, R & B, classic rock)who still relies on my fret markers periodically, but, and this is important, who doesn't read music but does understand basic music theory, there is little I could glean from this DVD as presented. There is no question that Bruno is incredible and his approach to scales appears to have considerable merit.  But he does not really 'teach' you what he is doing. His guitars have no fret markers and while I can follow him in slow motion as anyone probably could who understands the fret board, I am afraid this disc is only for the acomplished and those looking for a thoughtful approach to Jazz guitar.  Before he even gets to the basic chord voicings you have to buy into and learn his approach as a prerequiste. Had I known that and had I been prepared to spend months with this DVD (which I was not) I would not have bought it.  If you are really serious about Jazz guitar and want an interesting approach and you understand music theory and can read sheet music, then this might work for you.  Otherwise stay away.  I was looking for some further Jazz guitar chord voicings such as Aaron Stang (this guy is good) teaches in a couple of his dvds, to interject into the form of blues I am gravitating toward.  This wan't the disc and frankly was a waste of my money.  My mistake, I bought into what the guitar teacher's review said, but it was beyond me or the time I was prepared to devote to it.  There is a lot of good material out there of the 'here's how to do kind and why'. If that's what you are looking for then stay away. I want my money back but that isn't going to happen!  I feel I was misled, but that's my problem 
 The most horrifying film ever made. Clown House does the impossible, simultaneously pedestrian and brilliant, classic and clichéd, innovative and banal, dull and horrifying, with depressively wooden performances that upon Platonic examination are agonizingly electrifying. It is as trite as an Olsen Twins montage, and as grave as a snuff film. This movie is an abomination.   And yet it must be viewed twice. Once with the innocent eyes of an esthete video aficionado, beer and popcorn at hand, watching a horror movie with its usual familiar devices. This is the first level of text, for which critical engagement is not uncalled for. And yet, the more compelling text is beneath this surface, and points to the final aporia. For this is not fictive horror, this is documentary horror.  The script takes its inspiration from Lon Chaney's assertion that "There is nothing scarier than a clown after midnight," and follows Casey, an eleven-year-old boy with an unexplained fear of clowns. Against his conscience, he joins his two unsympathetic brothers on an excursion to the circus with a partial agenda to confront his fears. That same night three psychopathic killers escape a local mental hospital and appropriate the accoutrements and twisted guise of the circus's clowns, and proceed to the boys' house to "unhinge a jack-in-the-box of nightmares for Casey and his brothers!" This formula is not without charm.  And now for the subtext. In the horror genre, there is a visual device of using "the killer's point of view." This cliché is absent from Clown House, but the predator is indeed behind the camera, for director Victor Salva's degenerate weltanschauung is the true iniquity that has been recorded. For during the entire filming of Clown House Salva was raping the child star Nathan Forrest Winters, scarring him forever, smothering his spirit, and debasing him as a piece of meat. Winters' leaden acting is a direct result, for he could no longer invoke his art through the depression. This film, therefore, is not even child pornography, for it is far worse, it is the coded diary of a monster who disguises himself and his art in the innocent thrills of a horror movie. Almost like a clown, yes? Superficially innocent fun, yet underneath a monster, unknown and disguised. John Wayne Salva: Victor Gacy.  And this is the horror from which we cannot turn away. This is the "fascination of the abomination," this is Ricoeur's archetypes of sin, defilement, and guilt all incarnate in digital images, for this is evil. All engraved in a 1:33.1 aspect ratio for your convenient viewing pleasure.  Yet there is another text at work here: Salva recorded the whole thing. It is almost as if he wanted to be caught, wanted a parent to burst in and chase the monsters away. "Look at me! See what horrible thing I am doing! I'm getting away with it!" the twisted child cries into the night, and grows to complete the circle himself.  On first viewing there is a pointlessly long shot of Winters undressing to his underwear, which only marginally contributes to the tension of vulnerability. But on second viewing, when we know that we are watching the film through the eyes of Winter's rapist, it becomes the most horrifying shot in the film, and is in fact the probably method of Salva's seduction. Is that Salva's voice calling to Winters "Let's rehearse this scene [and then I'll rape you]?"   Only Paolo Pasolini's "Salo: One Hundred Days of Sodom" approaches the debasement of this film, yet Pasolini's painful sadomasochistic abuse of children was all faked. In "Clown House," Salva's off-camera rape of Nathan Forrest Winters is real, and as the narrative unfolds we witness the light extinguished from his eyes and his depression set in. For Winters, the film's "jack-in-the-box of nightmares" was in Salva's pants. How happy Winters must originally have been to think he was going to be a movie star when Salva cast him. How abandoned Winters must of felt when Salva returned that happy trust with daily rape and depraved self-gratification at Winters expense. All this psychological horror for this young actor is captured here on film.  Dante Alighieri lacked the vision to construct an appropriate circle of Hell for director Salva. But for this film and his abuse of Winters, he is surely going there. That should give us some comfort 
 One reviewer said this filter does not work in all Krups 10-12 coffee makers--as advertised.  What's up with this, Krups 
 This one is a trip to say the least. It starts strange even from  the menu (my menu's play button says "On Air"). Then we go steaming into the movie itself. A crazy housewife throws herself and her retarded son off a building. Cut to a mildly intense (and very exploitively shot) rape scene. Then we are experiencing the day to day happenings of a home for the retarded - where the head administrator is the rapist. I'm not really spoiling anything here. The movie lets this on about 20 minutes in. The man that plays the rapist goes over the top, to say the least. At one point he stalks around his room, crazy and horny  (wearing a jock strap, no less) fondling and strangling a  mannequin. The movie tries to hide its lust for exploitation under the guise of being a film about a serious subject. You can ultimately tell that it was filmed for the T and A. There's quite a bit during the two rape scenes. Also, the helpful teacher gets dolled up towards the end. Although her idea of being sexy is seductively drinking a clamdigger - celery included. But there is no nudity from her sadly (I think she's cute). And it is rather off putting to have the guy walking around in more revealing uderwear than the women. I mean, he's wearing a thong, for God's sake! Is this a Chinese metaphor for being "crazy and sexually rapacious"? You be the judge. I will say, I have seen a lot of bizarre translations on Asian imports, but this one contains one of the classics. During a scene when an angry crowd is confronting the administrator out front of the home - a man yells in his face and says "You let me f*** and a**  and I say your good, damn!" And he's supposed to be angry at this guy? Truly a hilarious moment. And people in the film refer to rapists as "sex lupines". I really don't know how to translate that one. Ultimately a bizarre flick that doesn't deliver on much that it promises. The rape scenes are not too schocking (especially when compared to something like IRREVERSIBLE). I will say the last sequence is pretty gruesome. Fluorescent bulbs and table saws, anyone? Ultimately, a lot of the acting comes off as B-grade. Some sickos out there - we are legion - might enjoy parts, but most would probably prefer to stay away.  I'm keeping my copy though... 
 I think the evidence is pretty clear at this point that McCarthy was right on target with his accusations.  Its amazing to me that liberals still cling to this "McCarthyism" myth.  It just didn't exist.  There was no repression of ordinary Americans in the 50s. Didn't happen.  Sure, some people in government lost their jobs. But they were communists who then got other jobs selling insureance or whatever.  Its not like they were sent to the gulag or anything. 
 please, editors, tell the new writer that a given plot must be cohesive.  A friend of Qwill's is killed in an accident, a friend who is the significant other of a fellow whom Qwill has known since he, the fellow, was a youngster, and Qwill does----NOTHING!!???  Get out of town!  Also, why was that hunting accident/murder thrown in?  Where did it go?  Nowhere!  Get the new author, or authors, up to speed 
 I am a big fan of the Requisites series of texts.  In general, they are some of the best introductory radiology textbooks available, with great organization and well selected content.  However, the Musculoskeletal  Requisites has little in common with the other books.  It is organized into  a series of neverending lists, which, while perhaps suitable for a study  guide, make the reading of the book a chore.  While none of the Requisites  books are definitive texts, this one has more holes in its content than the  others as well.  Hopefully the book will be completely revamped for the  second edition.  I can't recommend it in its present form 
 Not the best compulation I would have come up with. Only had one or two songs on it that I liked. But oh well Its in my collection now. Maybe it will grow on me later 
 I'm baffled by the glowing reviews posted by PW, Booklist, and my fellow amazon readers.  This book is nowhere near the quality of earlier Francis efforts (see Whip Hand, Forfeit, Come to Grief, Enquiry).  As a couple of other reviewers have noted, familiar characters--Jenny, the Admiral, Archie Kirk, Jenny's new husband--have undergone complete personality transplants.  Wonderful characters from previous books now come off as weak and foolish (or bitchy in the case of Jenny & Anthony).  Even Sid has lost his magic.    Rigorous editing would have helped, and surely Francis deserves Putnam's best.  But in this book, the usual spare and effective dialogue has turned clunky ("I've got to make a phone call," I said to the policeman.  "Now!  It's urgent!"), awkward ways of passing information to the reader abound (several sentences of dialogue begin "As you know ...", and at one point an asst trainer gives _Sid_ an explanation on the importance of not smoking in a stable!!!), and portions of the plot are weak (see the thoroughly inexplicable behavior of villain in ch. 19).   But, honestly:  I'll keep reading these books as long as Francis keeps publishing them.  (There are strong passages and elements here, in addition to the problems I mention above.)  Here's hoping we see a return to form in the next effort.  And many, many thanks for the dozens of fabulous novels that came before 
 This is one of the few metal albums that can put me to sleep. Isn't Enya supposed to put you to sleep? I should buy this just to put it on at night when I have to wake up early in the morning and my roommate won't get off the phone or starts cooking or something. We could probably use this against rabid dogs or study narcolepsy with it. Clowns aren't scary, either, so stop it 
 I'm sure this was a fun video in its time, but the moves are just too 80's 
 If you are doing the regular two week route of  Luang Phrabang - Vang Vieng - Vientiane, this is an outstanding book, despite the inevitable dating of hotel and restaurant info.  You have got to expect this considering how much stuff is written about these three places and Laos in general, leaving only a third of the book to cover the other 99% of the country.  The only really useful bits were the map and suggested itineraries where the authors actually offered their opinions.   Generally the "around the area" sections are far less useful than anyone you would meet in the street of the town because of the emphasis on describing restaurants and hotels.  As if anyone would have difficulty in finding the only restaurant or guesthouse in a one street village.  Buying a map and talking to other travellers was far better, more fun, and cheaper than the LP 
 I'm giving this dvd a 1 star not because all three episodes are crappy but because 15 is such a let down. Don't get me wrong, 13 and 14 are a must see but in 15 way too much is changed within the personalities of the charachcters it just seems like there are totally different writers this time. Episode 16 isn't quite as bad as 15  but you can tell the story has been greatly thinned out compared to  the first 14 episodes 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 A uniformly bland book.  The author says in 11 chapters what could easily be said in a couple of paragraphs.  And then, in the final chapter, he completely loses it and embarks on some sort of ridiculous diatribe against AI research.  He displays an amazing degree of animosity towards those involved in this field of research, some of which he names personally.  There are many far better books on usability available from Amazon.com, forget this one.  What can I say, Leonardo would dismiss him as a fool 
 The Berenstain Bears and the Messy Room is about Bother and Sister Bear who never clean their room. One day, Momma bear had enough and made the cubs change their way. After talking, they decide to do something about it.  This book teaches children about responsibility. This book is good for children from 4-11. I thought it was a pretty good book 
 I'm glad that I got this book out from the library instead of buying it. It provides extremely conventional advice about self-esteem and makeup, and the clothes the author suggests for teens seem like they're straight from the 80's. I really don't know anyone who wears scarves, overalls, or blouses to school. The language and general writing style of the author also seems outdated. I actually checked the publishing date to see if this was a 90's book; it's a 2000 book. Ms. Youngs even uses the 80's spring/summer/autumn/winter system of choosing clothing and makeup colors. It's also annoying that the book encourages confidence in one's looks and "beauty diversity", yet has photos mostly of stereotypical blonde-haired-blue-eyed all-american-girls. The author herself was a Miss Teen Claifornia finalist, so I suppose one couln't expect much more. I would avoid buying this for a young girl, or avoid buying it for yourself if you are a young girl 
 The first CD in the package is a "Greatest Hits" CD.  The second CD in the package was nothing but unheard hip hop stuff and a couple of her hits with the hip hop rythm added to it. Wished I hadn't bought the CD and spent extra money on it 
 I have to help my 5th. Grade daughter to understand this book, can anybody help me first! If you have read and have a summary could you share! Thank 
 The book may be entertaining to read because of the way Mankiw sets his examples. Unfortunately what we have in our hands is the same irrealistic exposition of how the economy works that has been dominating university curriculums from the first day Adam Smith was appointed at Glasgow. As an example I may cite my personal experience as a teaching assistant. When explaining the comparative advantage theory I obviously gave the Ricardian demonstration of the theory. But when I wanted to treat the absolute advantage theory, Marx's name was nowhere to be found. Even Samuelson devoted some pages to Marx's contribution to economic theory. President Bush's economic advisor seems to lack objective exposition when dealing with basic economic theories. I don't consider myself to be paranoid, but the economics curriculum, and it's instruments, such as this book, only serve a mode of reproduction of the dominant ideology, which we all know has lots of contradictions that everyday spring up in everybody's life. It is time to bring to the market a more balanced exposition of the various tendencies within economics, even if the course is described as being introductory. Most of the people who take these basic courses don't even know that there are alternative paradigms. They just finish their Mankiw's as if nothing else could be thought about how the economy really works 
 I have discovered that Mr. Byock's translation is regrettably bland.  It appears that he translates word-for-word, which gives the English prose a clumsy, "summarizing" kind of a feel.  The translation lacks a beautiful, flowing quality that might emerged had he tried to portray the spirit of the work through his own personal, subjective experience.  Said again, he should have taken personal "ownership" of the story and written it in modern English according to his own inner feeling -- richly imagining the events and meaning, and then writing a faithful, but new story.  Instead, he rather logically translates word-for-word, with seemingly little care for the poetic quality of the tale.  Thus the reading is bulky and unimaginative.   I believe that portraying one's own inner experience of a story is more "valid" than a scientifically-accurate rendering of it.  Although the text is clear, to a fault, I was disappointed with it.  I recommend a different translation. 
 This is not a well-rounded story centered on plot or adventure. This is a rambling rampage through meaningless and disconnected events, thoughts, and shady characters.   Anne introduces dozens of separate situations and characters and constructs a weak web around them. When the excitement in these mini-plots is building up, she completely ruins the story by Marius, the main character's, foolish immature whining and utter desolation of mind. Anne could have done so much with this story if she simply picked a plot line and followed through with it!  Whenever something interesting is about to happen, Marius begins to weep or have second thoughts, or he simply runs away and hides from the world. Terrible, really.  Marius's constant whining and heartache over Pandora, a former love of his, is not particularly believable. I find it silly how Marius, a godly and erudite vampire and former Roman Patrician, is incapable of getting over a lost love. Come on, what kind of fortitude and dignity is that when you can't forget about some woman you haven't seen or heard from in over a THOUSAND years? If Anne Rice would have been able to depict the romance between Pandora and Marius as though they were meant to be, as though they were absolute soulmates, then MAYBE Marius's annoying whining would have been tolerable. However, Anne Rice did the exact opposite. She didn't show love, she told love, and she did it very badly and once more played the 'ol "the world is pointless, I want to die" card.   Another thing that bothers me about this story is that there are no true antagonists, unless you count Marius's Jekyll and Hyde personality. Roger Ebert said of films that they are only as good as their own villain. I feel this is true of most contemporary fictions as well.  Anne Rice also awkwardly inserts personal obsessions (such as Botticelli) into the storyline; these additions add absolutely nothing to the story, and rather than making it more colorful or realistic or intense or ANYTHING positive, the story is diminished and becomes silly and tedious.  I rate Blood and Gold one star because it was poorly written and Anne Rice's fondess for the "breaking the fourth wall" literary technique irritated me to no end. Indeed, I must say that this was the worst book I have read in recent memory. I'm sorry for those who enjoyed it; I don't intend to offend, but I DO intend to write a review that mirrors my attitude towards this book correctly 
 Although the radio still works, the searchlight illuminated only once, the first time I turned it on. It hasn't worked again since.  The radio works while plugged in. Unplug it and come back in an hour and no more charge.  I used the hand crank, I cranked that handle for well over a minute, when I pressed the on button the radio didn't work!  This radio is worthless in an emergency.  I give it one star because this radio does work while plugged in. Plus the dial is well lit illuminating the stations in blue light 
 I purchased this book excitedly, because of the paucity of reading material directed at someone like me- a 43 year old, first time mother via infertility treatments, with a long and successful professional career.  Then I started reading, and my excitement deflated.   I don't think she was really committed to anything other than publishing a compilation of forced hilarity sit-com entries.   I thought her style was trying to emulate Ann Lamott....but with the cynical, savvy-New York City angle (Sex-In-the-City with babies and their poo), and without the heart or introspection that make Lamotts "Operating Instructions" so precious.   How does this book represent good writing?   She has not communicated so much to us... her motivation to get pregnant without the support of her husband, the complicated reasons why she has a very unconventional life, why she accepts incompetence from her contractor, why she is cowed by a Nanny.  I suspect it could be more interesting if we, again, got a peak at some real heart here.  Instead we get to read about how much money she can spend (except...well..not on a CRIB or DIAPERS...her friends/family have to come up with that for her after the babies are born), Manalo Blahnick shoes and exquisite catering...its often a very superficial and disappointing read that I basically slogged through. I have no doubt Ms. Newman is a wonderful mother and partner who deeply loves her children and husband...and I would have liked to read about that side of her, and that can be done with humor interfaced with self exploration.   If she had gone just a few shades deeper she could have made a very engaging book for many of us, especially if she was less enamored with her fabulous lifestyle and more committed to an internal journey.   But hey, this is 2005.  We don't ask for depth and character anymore. We're satisfied with a yuk.  
 it's unbelievable how we can find, nowadays, people who call themselves "maoists". There is no logic. Maoism is violence and pure dictatorship... this book is a book of slogans and people who love a book  like this are looking for slogan and not for political consciousness. Try  Gramsci, it's really bette 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 I had never read a John Grisham book.  But I am generally a believer in the notion that "if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."  So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing.  A week ago I picked up "The Street Lawyer," and I was prepared to be entertained.  Boy, was I wrong.  This book stinks to high heavens.  This man cannot write.  "The Street Lawyer" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches.  I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy.  Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.  I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words 
 Being a big Russell Banks fan, I was very much looking forward to reading The Darling, a book that addresses a subject matter that is clearly a departure for Banks.  I wish he'd stuck with trailer parks and the rural working class. The only reason I finished the book was because I was so hoping something bad would happen to the heroine.  She is perhaps the least likable, least sympathetic heroine in a book I've ever read. What ever happened to writers writing what they know?  Banks using a woman as a first person narrator was a big mistake. Hannah rings so hollow to me, a supremely self-absorbed, irritating and, in many ways, dangerous person to anyone she encounters. The dialogue throughout -- particularly the trite conversations among the characters about the "sixties" -- was contrived and unreal.  I was immensely disappointed 
 Like Nick (London UK), I too learnt a different version of this history. It appears to me that one should question everything that is produced by the History Channel if this is the type of drivel that they put out. Face it Vietnam wasn't the first war the US lost. This program is pure US propaganda and is far from true history. I guess this will upset some, but lets face it "The first casualty of war is the truth" 
 I have found only one game out of the many that i have tried that the codes on this thing actually work on.  This action replay is basically a twenty dollar or more waste of plastic and the cardboard that it came in.  avoid like the plague 
 I honestly thought that Han Nolan could have done better. I mean yes, there was a moral to it, but it wasn't that great. I read it and did a oral book report. The book has too much going on. First she's with her mom, then her mom gives her away, then she leaves? 
 I agree with most of what the prior reviewer had to say, I was just overall less enthusiastic. Nothing really new. A much better journalistic exposition of the subject is still Hersh's "The Samson Option" 
 I fairly enjoyed the quaint opening of the movie with Jimmy fishing and reminiscing with his legal eagle pal.  However, then the problem of the endless rehashing of the rape began, and the antiquated ideas about "provocation of rape" were ceaselessly unpealed.  Leading to courtroom discussions about how she was dressed, how she acted, if she flirted.  Reflections of a bygone era when a crime wasn't a crime, but may have been a crime depending on the height of the skirt line.  But even worse than that is the ungodly length of court room banter, often sound and fury which disappointingly led to nothing at the end.  No smoking gun or interesting twist or clues to successfully assemble.  Just a court full of knicker snickerers and a trial that supposedly hinged on the prosecutor's awareness of  the victims paternal history.  Nonsense, and 3 hours down the tubes. However, the movie gets two stars for the clever and alert interjections of the judge, and the appearance of a young George C. Scott, who at that age was interestingly a deadringer for Michael Douglass.  Jimmy does a stand-up job as always 
 How some people gave this book a five star review is way beyond me.  First of all, I'd just like to mention that this nice book gives you schematic diagrams using symbols and other things without explaining them first! Secondly, if you want to understand electronics it can only be assumed that you want to understand the physics behind it! This book dedicates about a sentence to a paragraph to physics for each section.  Horrible! So basically, this INTRODUCTION to electronics doesn't do a lot of introducing you to anything! I'm on transistors right now, and I've spent days researching the physics of how they work on the Internet, and guess what? It's using schematics I don't understand, and yet again I'm going to have to do more looking on the net.  This book is not worth it.  Don't buy it! Just please, for your own sake, find another one.  Also, half the book is dedicated to projects.  That is, actually building electronic circuits! Why didn't the author just entitle this, "How to build electronic devices", then? It's beyond me! As far as explaining things are concerned, the book does very little, and assume you know more than you do.  Unfortunately I'm going to have to end up buying another electronics textbook, because this one is just horrible.  I was really wanting to learn something from this book, but it's just not happening.  For every chapter I've read on this book I've had to do research on the net, and I'm sick of it.  I'm on pg. 154, and I'm closing it.  DO NOT buy this book! I've already found a better book on amazon.com (just buy reading the Table of Contents!!!!!!!!!!) and I'm going to get it! 
 I have owned this chair for about 9 months. The seat bottom has flattened out and has torn a bit -- I can see the polyfill inside. It is not particularly comfortable anymore. The chair also creaks a lot (as is typical with most inexpensive chairs).  It's a lot of money for a chair that has the build quality of one of the cheapie leather chairs that can be had for under $50 
 Barry Longyear's story is perfect. This movie could have been but what was that bull at the end with the whips and factory slaves and that stuff? They should have ended the movie as the story ended and not added that last bit. That totally ruined the movie for me. The novella and its sequel at least give humanity the benefit of a doubt; the war is over and there is an uneasy peace and humanity, if love doesn't prevail, at least strives to be better. In the movie, they made humans brutal savages in the way they treated the Dracs. Did we learn NOTHING from the USA's foray into slavery and brutality? IT seemed that a violent ending was gratuitously grafted onto the movie to make it more palatable to the 13-18 year old testosterone crown, thereby destroying what could have been as perfect a film as the novella was perfect. But, when has Hollywood ever gotten it right? They usually find some way to shoot themselves in the foot. 
 La Femme Nikita is just not a very engaging film on any level. The action is totally surpassed in Besson's later work, the characters are annoying and/or too superficial -- but worse yet, the entire affair is dripping with pathos and a silly desire to make a political message. OBNOXIOUS French pablum 
 Few Times Do I Regret What I've Done In Life, Well I Regret The Purchase Of This CD/DVD. It Was The Most Unfunny Supposed Comedic Performance, I HAVE EVER SEEN. Nothing But Rehashed Old Jokes That Were Maybe One Time Funny To Someone, BUT NOT HERE. I Like Gilbert, I Usually Enjoy His Comedy, Not This Time. Sorry Gilbert. Better Luck Next Time. 
 I picked up this book as a way to familiarize myself with the changes to UML in UML 2.0, which are extensive, as I found the OMG specification nearly impenetrable. I had liked the first edition, though I too felt Fowler's Distilled was a much better intro to give to students and engineers learning UML for the first time. This edition, though, does not meet expectations. The typos and bad references throughout are bad enough. Join that with a complete lack of real-world design examples, poor organization, and poor design.  Why a chapter on State Machines and a separate chapter on State Diagrams that repeats a lot of the earlier chapter? The blue cross references make it clear that the book is spaghetti design at its worst. Check out the table of contents, you won't know where to look for your favorite diagrams; check out the index, and you won't be able to find the definition of the concept you just can't quite remember. The glossary is useful, as the UML 2.0 spec dispensed with a glossary, making it even more impenetrable. On the other hand, the authors make no attempt to call out the new UML 2.0 features, which would have made my day. What I find most unforgivable, though, is the authors' inability to present the new UML as it really is: the book is seriously misleading in many ways for learning UML 2.0. My biggest peeve is the way they treat the new and highly useful composite structure diagrams. In the list of diagrams, they don't even mention it, calling it by the name of a different diagram, the "Component Diagram", which they feel is the same thing. They then separate the discussion of composite classes and components, making it seem as though they're totally unrelated. They fail to mention quite a few of the new UML features (the X navigation adornments that make non-navigability explicit, for example, which is critical to code generation, or the fact that you can have multiple stereotypes associated with model elements. In their defense, the UML standard isn't very clear on these diagram types, but this is a practical tutorial that should take practice into account. There are constant references to the Reference Guide for more advanced features; these are mostly the UML 2.0 features that they didn't feel were important enough to include in the comprehensive tutorial. The appendix on UML notation simply ignores many UML 2.0 notations. I can't help but feel shortchanged 
 Just like the old Chariots of Gods, his books are very interesting and and entertaining.  But please dont think that you are reading a scientific work.  Real historical works are not as sexy and entertaining as these books just as real archeologists are not Indiana Joneses.  
 I was given this book as a birthday present from someone who knew I liked writers like Tess Gerritsen and Lisa Gardner.  Having never read any of the previous 'Scarpetta' novels, I will confess that I was somewhat in the dark about the history of the characters.  Unfortunately, I could find no characters that I cared about or were the least bit interested in.  I was also given another 'Scarpetta' novel to read, but I think I am going to pass.  BLOW FLY was absolutely unreadable.  One of the worst reading projects I have ever attempted.  
 Gardner's book is full of banal and often incorrect observations. It's hard to believe he has received over 20 honorary degrees from universities around the world if his ideas are this unoriginal. He chooses the staggeringly bad examples of Margaret Thatcher, George Bush and BP CEO John Browne as people who have successfully changed minds. He doesn't mention that Thatcher and Bush antagonized large sections of their countries' populations, completely failing to change their minds, in fact hardening their positions of opposition; in large part due to these leaders' own refusal to ever change their minds or consider alternative policies. Gardner lavishes praise on Bush for switching from isolationism to an interventionist foreign policy after 9/11, without any mention of the PNAC team that had already planned to invade Iraq even before 9/11.   As for John Browne, his claim to have repositioned BP as an environmentally and socially concerned company has been discredited in the past year with the explosion at a Texas refinery and the oil spill on the North Slope that led to the admission that BP hadn't done any of the anti-corrosion work it was supposed to do on its pipelines.   Another poor example is Lawrence Summers of Harvard. For some reason Gardner doesn't mention the biggest controversy Summers was involved with, when he said that women could never be as good at science as men. Gardner's use of case studies from academia is another bad choice because most readers won't have heard of these professors and won't care much about their internal disputes. It's a shame Gardner didn't tackle any real-life problems, such as how to change the minds of Creationists.   Gardner insists on using "she" and "her" instead of "he" and "his" as the neutral pronoun for political correctness, and another irritating habit he has is to invent jargon that will obviously never catch on, such as "wetware" and "dryware" for the internal workings of the brain and "GoodWork" for being ethical at work, yet another painfully banal concept.   In one section Gardner describes how a psychologist uses a patient's dream to understand how the patient sees himself (or should I say herself even if he was male?) in relation to others, which sounds to me like total cod psychology, but that's just my own reaction to dream interpretations.   Regarding computers, Gardner believes that people are starting to prefer interaction with computers over interaction with other people. This again is utterly mistaken and it's clear that Gardner has next to no experience with the internet. Thanks to the internet there has been an explosion in human interaction and far more people talk with other people than with computers. Gardner says people can get emotional solace from interaction with computers that are programmed to communicate and cites a book written in 1995, but gives no further justification of this claim.   Anyone writing about changing minds ought to have a full understanding of how people use the internet and communicate on all kinds of levels that weren't possible before this technology existed, for example role-playing or participating in a political discussion forum, as well as absorbing surreptitious marketing on the internet.   Gardner's specific advice on how to change minds consists of using a variety of words that all begin with "re" for convenience, eg resonance and resistance. I had hoped to learn how to communicate my ideas better from this book, but all I learnt was that it was a bad book. 
 I will keep this short. The only necessary chapter to read is on the Zahal. the IDF. Much of the book depends on silly, childish praise for the realistically superior Israeli Force. So much so that it makes for pedantic reading. I do not recommend. 
 The author happened to meet rather strange characters that make her end up with a pretty inaccurate impressions about the country. I grew up in this country, and I spend half year there every single year, and yet I could not recognize any of the features decsribed in this book. Hence - be carefull, readers. If you are just looking for a "story" - the book might be perfectly OK, and it reads well, but please, do not believe it gives you an accurate picture of the country 
 I ordered the book expecting the breakthrough system advertised on the cover.  Instead, the book is about going to networking events to meet people to trade referrals with.  I guess that's ok if that's your thing but it's not mine, it sure never got me anywhere, heck, the top sales guys I know won't even bother with those events.  The first 100 pages are spent just trying to convince you that referral selling is the only way to sell.  Ok so cold calling is out but I don't think referral selling is the only option.  I might have given the book a better rating if the cover told the truth and I knew I was buying a book about going out to networking mixers. Referral selling is old news and there are plenty of other books about it.  I feel let down by what I got.  And you know what?  The book isn't half bad if going to networking events is your thing.  That's why I gave it better than one star.  But why not tell people what they're getting up front?  The author needs to study up on relationship selling because you sure don't build good relationships by promising one thing and delivering another.  And why are all the 5-star reviews from people in her area in CA 
 I was expecting to hear some extremely original and great music, but this definitely misses the mark.  This is an artist trying to sound like other artists, SRV, John Mellencamp, etc.  If you were to hear this music you would know its wasn't the artists he is trying to sound like, and probably wouldn't want to hear repeatedly.  His voice is fairly weak and indistinct and his guitar is so muddied it is hard to tell what he is trying to achieve.  He might be fun to see at your local pub on a Saturday night, but if you like good rock and good blues, buy something by SRV, Eric Clapton, or Gary Moore.  I thought this was going to be a revelation, but the only thing it revealed; listen to Johnny Lang for better vocals, guitar, and arrangements; for a young up and comer.  This CD is going back to the store for an exchange or trade, but it won't be spinning in the player 
 Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book.  Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise.  Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research.  This gives the result that in many instances, his "proof" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim.  Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what "American" life really is.  He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote.  There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best.  
 A first novel--and it shows. Has all the charm of Barbara Pym's best work (Excellent Women, No Fond Return of Love) but is marred by narrative clumsiness and (frankly) lousy technique: characters appear out of nowhere, conversations start one place and end in another, etc. Skip this and focus on her later, great work 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 This book is probably useful for learning what missionaries are up to out there in the non-Christian world.  However, it does not stop to ask whether they SHOULD be out there.  And of course, from a cross-cultural and anthropological point of view, they should not.  It is arrogant, ethnocentric, and culturally destructive to spread a culturally-relative and almost certainly false ideology and belief system where it is not needed or wanted.  Missionaries have been the source of much of the world's trouble, and they still are.  But more essentially, the whole idea of missionazation is judgmental and intolerant. Why do those people need you and your "belief"?  How would you like it if they were missionizing you!  Oh, but you think your religion is true!  Well, so do they!  It seems all missionaries and those they missionize have in common is a lack of cultural understanding.  If we recognized religion as the relative (different in different places, not "true" in any meaningful way) and damaging, irrational thing it is, we would stop supporting it and start supporting real efforts that help people in real ways 
 Major themes in Missing May will be of concern to some parents, yet are not easy to discern from the book's summaries. The characterizations are good. There are moments that might help a reader be more sympathetic towards people who look or act in a way that seems odd to them.   However, in the spiritual realm, there is much to entice readers into the "Church" of Spirituality, the occult, seeking answers with mediums and more. This bundle of confusion is all wrapped in a Newbery award winner which will be on every required reading list throughout the land.   There are parents who would not wish their children to have these issues painted in a positive light, or would like to discuss these things with their children in the light of their own values, but who do not have a clue about the content judging from the book summary. The Newbery award will make it even more likely that unsuspecting parents will have their children read this book, unaware of any conflict with their beliefs.    
 Misled by its title, I was expecting that this book was about making rustic furniture. However only the last third of the book is about this. Two thirds of the books (100 p.) consists in  a gallery of pictures (with some comments), mostly chairs. Their style is not modern, but not traditional either. I find most to be weird or snob. Actually many look postmodern to me (they may not all be from the author, but from his friends -many being also from New York City like him). These may be a source of inspiration for some, but definitely not what I am looking for.  And that last third of the book, about making things is also quite a deception in itself. It is a collection of shallow articles by other authors, who show projects they make,   with a very vague and general talk about the technique they use. One uses tenons and mortises (anyone knowing a bit about conventional woodworking will not learn anything here), and worse, others use nails and even bolts (the last one). I really learned nothing from this. In addition, this is all about dry wood.   I recommend instead Les Smith's Build your own Log Furniture (only a little bit of technique, for dry softwood, but at least something...), and much more a book where you really can learn many things: Drew Langsner's Green Woodworking 
 What the world didn't need was a 4-CD box set of the same, tired disco we hear on every K-tel compilation CD, and in this box set, they got it.  This is radio disco, not club disco.  There are no surprises, no lost or extended mixes, nothing we might have heard in the New York clubs in the 70s or early 80s.  Where are Freddie Mercury, Dennis Parker, France Joli, or Bonnie Pointer?  How many more times do we have to hear Y.M.C.A.?  Rhino really missed the dance boat.  Shame on them 
 Psychology Today purports to deliver the latest trends in psychological studies to the layman, but what it really delivers is pop psychology and a whole lot of advertisements.  I give the magazine one star for a very snazzy layout, and a second star for hiring writers that don't insult the reader's intelligence by abusing alliteration (unlike another magazine supposedly aimed at intelligent adults).  However, the content is consistently concerned more with pop culture than with the lives of real people.  I have also noticed a bias against introverts in article after article that attacks shyness as a serious character defect, rather than simply a personality trait (so, introverts, if you want to avoid yet another lecture on how your way of relating to the world is intrinsically wrong, avoid this rag) 
 The first movie was totally unexpected, had great music, including some original John Cafferty gems not written specifically for the movie and a cast that included Tom Berenger, Ellen Barkin and Emmy winner Joe Pantoliano.  This allowed it to make up dialog that was sometimes cringe inducing and sometimes wonderful ("Words and music, Wordman, words and music", "But we ain't great, we're just some guys from Jersey").  Make a second low-budget sequel, but lose 3 great cast members and use music written specifically for the film and you can't help but have problems.  Combine that with some poor artistic decisions:  A key dialog between Eddie and Tom Berenger on beach in the first movie is cut and spliced in a flashback that shows the dialog between Eddie and the bass player Sal.  First, Sal, now portrayed as Eddie's best friend was treated with nothing but disdain by Eddie in the first movie ("what are you, a moron Sal?").  Second, the day they shot the shots of Sal the weather was different than the original scene, so every time they show Sal's face the weather changes.  As a huge Eddie I fan, I'm glad I saw this movie just to see the resurrected Eddie Wilson.  As a movie fan there were times I found myself laughing out loud.  The second star in the review carries over from the classic original 
 The woman who helped engineer the useless war against the Christians in the Balkans (to help Klinton distract us fro Monicagate), promoted our sales of technology to the Korean Dictator so he could threaten the world with his nukes, is now in a panic to justify her actions which so harmed America. I cannot read the reviews which praise her without wondering how she could be so misunderstood/identified.  She is a disgrace 
 I found this book of little use. The major problems created by using race as the main focus of the book include: *	Race as a subject is so overworked that nearly everyone over eight years of age has come to conclusions about race, the most important and most common of which is "I am not racist." However, given how the human brain works (selective attention, generalization, and others) and how humans interact (tribal affiliation, application of generalizations based on visual input, and so on), prejudice and therefore racism are inevitable: We are all racist whether we think so or not. *	Again, because the issue of race is overworked, the reaction of many people when race is introduced as a subject is, "Not again!" This could be overcome by a unique or fresh approach. Outside of Chapter 7, "Toward an Understanding of School Achievement", nothing new or fresh is provided.  On the positive side, the case studies are well written and well selected. In a different literary context, these case studies could be of immense value. Also, Chapter 7 has value to offer.  Yes, I realize that racial discrimination issues are critical, especially given the level of racial discriminiation that exists in the human family. However, focusing on such discrimination as the root issue has stalled civil rights. It has accomplished pretty much all it is going to accomplish. It is time to recognize that predudice is part of the human condition.  I invite Ms. Nieto or others to write a text based on the biological and sociological roots of prejudice aimed at helping the reader and, in the context of college classes, the student realize their own propensity for prejudice, recognize how it might show up, and correct the issues of their own prejudice as they emerge. 
 I didn't like this book one little bit.  Not to say it's offensive.  Just dull, predictable, and, well, I hate to say this, but immature.  Let me preface this by saying that Spider Robinson has some sweet ideas about humanity.  His notion that a bunch of people getting together to share their pain and joy is very nice.  It's not that I'm cynical (Well, I AM cynical) but it just never comes across as very believable.  None of these characters seem real to me at all.  Worse, they all seem like the same guy.  They all find the same things funny.  They all talk the same, all have the same attitude about life.  And never once did I find them remotely interesting, hence it was hard to find them very likable.  As for the humor, I guess I just don't get it.  It's lifeless stuff without much punch.  And puns?  Dear God, who outside of a ten year old thinks puns are that funny?  Maybe one or two, but come on, a whole book of them gets old fast.  Robinson's immaturity is the real handicap, made evident by his unsophisticated sense of humor and lack of in depth characters.  Even more obvious, like a little boy uncomfortable with the opposite sex, there are very few female characters in the story, which doesn't really bother me, but says something about the writer.  That said, there are plenty of people who enjoy Callahan's, even love it.  I guess I'm just not one of them.  
 Bought this one for Evolution class. It is a horrible excuse for a textbook. Do not buy this book unless it is for a middle school student. If the authors think this book has been written for an advanced audience, then I would suggest that anyone interested in learning evolution not attend University of Washington 
 I wasn't too into this one. I'm a big fan of Steinbeck's fiction, but this memoir is rather dull. I was looking to hear what he had to say about the zeitgeist of America at the time he wrote it. But as an older man (as he even admits) he isn't as inspired to talk to or rub shoulders with people whom he crosses paths. The ones that he does write  about come across as a bit uninspired. Nothing much happens on his journey and it almost seems like he doesn't have too much to say.   The one highlight was the last couple of chapters, when he goes to the South (New Orleans) and witnesses all the slimy, seperatists as they scream and holler, with pure craven hatred at the first little black children to be integrated into public schools. He is disillusioned and angry and when he tells the tale of what he saw it is absolutely heartbreaking.   As much as a mediocre work as it was, I did take an interest in it because I am a fan of Steinbeck. It was cool to hear him write a memoir. Other Steinbeck fans make get something out of it as well and for them I recommend it, just on that basis. As long as you take into account the stuff I said above. If you haven't read Steinbeck, please...start with "The Grapes of Wrath" or "Tortilla Flat." Those are much better works and will give you something to go on if you try to read this 
 I really like Bruce Campbell and his movies like Army of Darkness. But this movie is not in the same league. First of all the plot is slow and boring. Bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at. Instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move. This really hampers the action aspects of the movie. The dialogue aspect is not much better.   If you like Bruce, my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the TV episodes of  "Jack of all trades" episodes. It is a lot more fun and has the "real" Bruce 
 As others have noted, this is NOT the uncut version, but rather the very watered down R-rated version.  I have the R-rated copy, as well as this "director's cut", and they are identical.  This was either a grossly negligent error on the part of the studio, or a deliberate misrepresentation for the sake of increased sales.  Either way, if the real deal is what you seek, be forewarned and stay clear of this disk 
 "Blind Alley" is the fifth novel in the continuing story of Eve Duncan, forensic sculptor, Joe Quinn, Atlanta police detective and Jane MacGuire, their precocious seventeen year old adopted daughter rescued from the streets. Be warned that much of this review might be construed as spoilers but I'm betting that it's not going to matter much since you'll likely be giving the book a pass anyway!   I used to treat Iris Johansen as a sure thing! You know what I mean - the kind of author whose new title you'd add to your reading list without even caring what the plot line was or you'd pick up a copy at the store without even bothering to flip open the dust jacket for a peek! "Blind Alley" buried that thought - cold, deep and fast! It was a great deal more than just bad - it was truly painful!   A shadowy serial killer named Aldo is on the loose slaughtering women in a most unseemly, gruesome fashion. Carving their living faces right off their skulls, Aldo imagines himself responsible for the systematic elimination of all women who resemble Cira, a courtesan/actress/prostitute killed two thousand years ago in the town of Herculaneum when Vesuvius erupted. It would seem that Aldo is a little upset at having lost the love and attention of his father, an archeologist who became obsessed with Cira when he discovered her statue and some details of her life.   As if that isn't deep enough in left field as the premise for a thriller, imagine the eyebrows you'll raise when you read that Jane MacGuire, Eve Duncan and Joe Quinn's adopted 17 year old daughter is a ringer for Cira. Not only does she find herself stalked by Aldo but some inexplicable psychological attachment to Cira plagues Jane with regular nightmares in which she is trapped in caves or tunnels fleeing for her life from the eruption of Vesuvius.   It doesn't end there - Johansen tosses Mark Trevor into the mix. He's a con and an antiquities smuggler (picture Lovejoy with a nasty streak!) who had a run-in with Aldo and is intent on killing him. To that end he intrudes himself into Eve Duncan's and Joe Quinn's life and sets himself up as Jane's protector. Now, I'm no prude but the scene in which Trevor, a grown man at least as old as Joe, has a near sexual encounter with Jane, a typical seventeen year old teenager with respect to her hormones and sexuality, is just plain distasteful and, frankly, scored well into the red zone on the "yuk" meter!   There is just so much wrong with this novel, it's difficult to know where to begin and where to stop - nightmares that start, happen and end with no explanation or psychological development at all; unlike any previous Johansen novel I've read, the characters and dialogue seem trite, wooden and completely contrived; the outcome of Mark Trevor as a character is left spectacularly un-resolved; Eve Duncan's obsession with her murdered daughter, Bonnie, continues unabated and is definitely becoming downright irritating; a wonderful sub-plot concerning Eve's forensic reconstruction of a real skull from the Vesuvius eruption was simply deep-sixed!   I still own a few Johansen titles that I haven't read so there is perhaps hope. But she'll have to prove to me that she hasn't jumped the shark before I'll spend another cent on a new title!

 This is the worst hair setter that I have ever purchased!  They get too hot to handle, but the worst are the flimsy clips they give you to "hold" them in place.  They are so cheap that when you slide them in over the roller, they stretch; therefore, not holding in the curler.  They fall out as soon as you let go of them!!!!  
 I am a wife who was cheated on. How pathetic that there is a book out there to help the other woman. Don't waste money on this book as I will give you advice for free. Ready? Don't date married men you slimeballs 
 I swear if it wasn't that i liked final fantasy 7 and 8 so much i'd just break this game at then i'd move on and be happy. But i can't do that because that would be waste of money the only thing that kept me in the game was the fact that i did'nt want to waste money. This game makes kingdom hearts look like a M rated game. Oh my god this is so childish. You know how in most final fantasy games they try to make the main character cool they didn't feel like doing that in this one. You are a monkey-man! How stupid is that. Plus the other character are way more dumb looking that the main one im just happy i beat in and can put that awful exp. behind me. AHHHHHHHHHH 
 I bought this audio CD set at the Borders store, without the opportunity to preview the narration. Had I been able to do so, I probably never would have purchased it, let alone paid full bookstore price for it. But I needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day, so I relented.   Lesson learned.  The audio quality is very insonsistent, at at times very poor, having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording.   While the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the Middle East, it does read very much like a history text. With the amount of detail presented, and the wide scope of coverage from one end of Europe reaching into the former Soviet states and beyond, one immediately feels the need for visual aids (maps, timelines, etc.) as guidance.   The reader's narration is monotononous, with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses. Each sentence sounds the same as the last. This has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other, and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity. After a while, the narration becomes little more than background noise. No information is retained by the listener 
 I have really enjoyed most of the Jury series, especially the interactions between Jury and Plant.  This book, however, fails to deliver in my opinion.  She starts off with a wonderful premise and could have really built upon it....but she didn't.  The book starts to become annoying because she gets lost in "educating" the reader on quantum physics.  I kept nodding off and wondering if I'd ever be able to finish this book.   I skimmed through so much of the last few chapters and still found that you're left hanging at the end.  It's not even the fact that Harry walks away in the end, it's more that Grimes fails to give anything in the story proper closure.    I don't really know what she was aiming at with this one, but it really missed the mark for me.  I agree with the other reviewer who said she seems to be tired of writing Jury.  Even Melrose Plant has lost some luster in this book and he usually shines through in most of them.    I noticed the next title in this series is "Dust" ... I fear that may be a literal description of this series at present.  It's dry as dust to me.  
 Don't be fooled by the enticing 6 megpixels that this camera offers.  I'd been waiting along time to upgrade from my 3 MP Nikon Coolpix SQ as the prices of the higer resolution cameras continued to drop.  What've I've discovered, however, is that there is so much sensor noise in the full resolution 6 MP images from this HP camera that the additional resolution is worthless.  The images look absolutely horrible.  My little Nikon SQ with it's lower resolution produces much sharper pictures at every image size.  Do your homework and make sure that the sensor in the camera you're buying is a good one 
 I read other review, and decided to give it a try. As soon as I recieve it in the mail, and opened the box, I realized this was a mistake. CHEAP quality Binocular with "high power" being a selling point. It came in already broken with two eye ruber pieces falling apart. you can see how the cheap glue was being used to put it in place! It is extremly heavy to hold in hands for more than one minute for nature observation. You will be CONSTANTLY ajdusting the focus. Your fingers bumps with focus bar while you are holding it. Indeed Strap, Case, Lense protectors are all cheap crap, and annoying to have it all ON~! I am taking this back, and buying MADE IN JAPAN "NIKON EAGLE VIEW" 100 times BETTER. YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR~!!!!! 
 i ordered THIRD MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN DVD.....before i ordered this DVD.....was sometime in January 2007 and i paid for top speed delivery.....i received the other DVD in my order but not THIRD MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN DVD.....nothing yet....  can u look into where it is please......i have emailed before but have not received any response...and wont order again from AMAZON\ thank you  Glenda Papa 
 The themes in this story were SO repetitive - I get it already! And there were so many details, they bogged the story down. I found myself skimming in lots of places, and don't feel like I missed anything. 
 J. Michael Veron apparently sat down to write The Greatest Player Who Never Lived in the same manner a trial lawyer would write a closing argument.  He tells us what he's going to say, then he says it, then he sums up what he just said.  There was very little tension in the story, only piles of documents to sift through along with the main character.  It is at times laborious reading with a pleasant twist at the end.  Golf fanatics and lawyers (who play golf) will enjoy it.  Otherwise skip this tiresome read 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 It was very weird because he never used proper English and always said cos instead of because and there are so many random words that have been fully capitalized.  I still have not finished the book but it takes a while for me to read it because of the confusing plot.  Recently a couple times I have had to re-read the part before so I can understand it.  In my opinion, if you are looking for the intense book that the back says you will be fooled.  I went into the bookstore and read the back and thought it looked interesting, but when I got home and began reading it...it was a totally different book than it says.  Do not buy this book if your daughter or son likes suspense book because it isn't. 
 I'll keep this review short and sweet.  This book is an in-depth academic discussion of how humans see and perceive things.  Although there were some interesting tid-bits throughout the book, I wanted to learn how to improve the composition of my photographs, and didn't find anything of use.  This book is probably well-suited to a graduate-level psychology course, but for me it has little applicability to photography 
 This book is a little too ambitious in trying to cover a lot of ground: history of Chinese martial arts and taijiquan, what is qigong, what is taijiquan, photographs of the Yang long form, a few applications, and more. Unfortunately it is rambling with a lot of digressions of the author's own opinions on how taijiquan is "spiritual" - a little bit too long winded to be of practical benefit. Several reviewers mentioned the book draws on some of the author's other books so perhaps that explains this effect. Good basic content, but better editing would have made the book more organized and easier to read and study. There are some good practical tips on actual practice spruced throughout but they can be hard to spot. Overall, a more concise book focused on these tips would be much more beneficial. There are also too many self-serving references to the author's other books, which I found a little annoying. It seems he is more interested in selling a lot of different books than in writing one really good one. However, the photographs are of very high quality and the pages and binding seemed fine to me.   The bottom line: If you are BRAND NEW to the art and want to read a lot of context and commentary surrounding taijiquan, this book may be worthwhile for you. If you have been studying for a while and are looking mainly for practical tips on principles, this may not be the best book for you. There are other excellent books you should check out such as Fu Zhongwen's Mastering Yang Style Taijiquan 
 This was my first Catherine Coulter book and my last.  MAYBE, the author was trying to portray life during those times, but rape scenes between the hero & heroine isn't exactly what I'd call romantic...  One other little quirk I had was during her pregnancy...so..her husband pushed her down like a boulder, got stabbed in the side by a knife in the process, husband's ex-lover kicked her in the belly during a cat fight, fell off a cliff and hanging down on that cliff and STILL managed to keep the baby!?!?!   Nothing made sense in the entire book.. from the characters, to the plots, and to the title...nothing made sense! Like one reader was saying, its so bad its good 
 Hum, the GOP and and the killing of innocents in the middle east is the party of death. The GOP and its destruction of the wilderness and wildlife is the party of death.  The GOP and its tax breaks for the obscenely rich is the party of death.  The GOP and it disregard for the constiution is the party of death.  The GOP and its push for faith-based policy instead of science or fact-based policy is the party of death.  The GOP and its hatred of women's sexuality is the party of death.. 
 I didn't enjoy this book, even though I'm partial to sea stories.  There is not a single likable, admirable character in the book.  I don't think the author, Robert Stone, has spent much time sailing or knows much about the sea.  I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in reading sea stories.  Actually the sailing material does not play a large part in the plot and is not convincingly portrayed.  So what then is it about?  It seems to be about the misery of modern American life.  Stone wants his novel to be deep and epic but it is just depressing and dorky.  The symbolism and ideas are mostly shallow.  There's obscure religious undertones that made no sense to me.  The parent/child relationships portrayed in the book are utterly banal and ugly.  I found no humanity at all in any of the relationships.   And consider the title-"Outerbridge Reach."  Outerbridge Reach is supposed to be an area in New York Harbor where derelict boats lie (get the symbolism?).  But I think the author wanted to title his story "Outta Reach" and came up with this 'clever' twist on the title instead.  Basically what the book is about is how fulfillment, love, and happiness are outta reach.  If you like this kind of depressing thing, you'll love this book.   I don't and I didn't.  Having said all this, I must admit that I did read the entire novel which I don't usually do if I dislike a book.  The reason I read on is that Stone writes well and has an elegant and interesting prose style.  He knows how to skilfully pace a story.  It's a shame that his talent is wasted on such negative content 
 Really, it's about time for Ms Fluke to usher her characters into the 21st century!  Her storytelling has become progressively trite over the past couple of books and her characters remain thoroughly engrossed in the social mores of the 1950s.  As far as the Norman or Mike question, I am beginning to find that I have stopped caring.   I was so hoping that this book would be better than her last that I even pre ordered it.  I suggest that if you would like to read it, you borrow it from your local library and save the money.  A very disappointing read 
 This was my first and last Joe Weber book. The story was predictable and the characterizations were not compelling. It's not that Weber is a bad writer, it's just there are others who are so much better. I would rather read a bad book by a good writer than a good book by a bad writer. I love Clancy type books but this fell way short. He gets 2 stars for effort 
 To see my point read Edgar C. Whisenant's "Why The Rapture will be in 1988"  HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!     Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises.  This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old "The sky is falling", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times.  For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in "the last times." He "knows" this because he sees so many antichrists around.  1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the "last times. 1 Peter 4:7 "The end of all things is at hand." James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon.     Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called "End Time Signs" did NOT apply?  The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough?  One of the signs of the "mark of the beast" started in 1948.  The Doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the Social Security Number system.  Recently, someone "set a bad precedent" by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip (In the wayward animal of course)     It seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the Chicken Littles has been making excuses ever since it all began.    2 Peter 3:4 "Where is the promise of his coming?" The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years."  Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.  Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, "Behold, I come quickly.  Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!      
 I loved Operation Ivy immensly so I was so disappointed by how lame Rancid is. This album is pretty lame and its one of their best. After hearing Tim sing on this album I realized why they needed Jesse as lead singer in Op Iv. Now Tim is in that horrible "Transplant" band with the lame Blink 182 guy. Not to mention he's friends with that loser from GOOD CHARLOTTE!!! And the new Rancid music is sooooooo poesur. Ugggggghhhh. Although some of these songs are catchy they are all non-political and non-offensive. A lame excuse for punk rock, I probably would have liked Rancid back when I used to listen to Green Day. 
 First of all I want everyone to notice that this is only VOLUME 2.  Volume one is no longer available anywhere.  Thus, making this book fairly useless.  The only thing that it's really good at it showing different stiles between professional comic book inkers.  It nice to page through and I don't regret buyin it but it is not necessary for an artist's library 
 I bought this book as a quick reference for a Technical Support group I manage.  We have a few dozen products that require an installer to run wires throughout a house. Unfortunately, a large majority of the calls I get are wiring related and this book provides tremendous insight into the problems created by improper wiring.  If you want to learn about wiring, this is the book to buy.  I also bought the full book that goes with it.  It must be good because I got the only paperback, and all the used hardback books are almost double the retail price.   From this guide you'll learn everything relating to wiring.  You'll learn balanced vs unbalanced, ground loop isolation vs cross talk, and the list would almost be half as long as the pocket guide.  Simply put, if your livlihood depends upon wiring, this book will help you a great deal.  
 I had read the first chapter or so of this book in my email book club. I enjoyed it, and felt that Emily would be a relatable and interesting character, so when I saw it in my public library, I decided to give it a try. I read the whole thing in about a day, not really because it was great--more so that it was just a very quick, light read. The authors fail to develop some of the most interesting characters beyond mere cliches, and spend too much time on less interesting ones.   Now, I'm not saying the book wasn't cute and amusing--a quick, light, and often funny read. (I almost think Emily's hilarious boss was the highlight of the whole book!) But I, like several other reviewers, was disappointed about the lack of depth of spiritual depth. Emily, in the beginning of the story, seems like she will be the kind of girl to have a strong faith and stand out from the crowd. After all, she always says she wants to change the world. But, instead, she follows the crowd, doesn't even admit she's a Christian to her closest friends, (she only admits she's a Christian to her very closest friend, and stands up for her faith at the very last minute, so that it hardly seems sincere) and begins drinking rather heavily. I thought the authors would use that to show how she'd changed by the end of the book, but it instead shows her laughing with her friends (over multiple beers) about how she refused to drink alcohol the first time they went out to a bar together. Another thing that bothered me was how Emily attended a singles bowling night with Christians from a local church, and repeatedly put them down, portraying them as boring, corny, and behind the times. I sincerely hope that the authors (and am almost sure that it was not their intent) did not mean to put down more conservative Christians, who do not drink and who don't try to be worldly, as Emily does. But, even if the scene was intended to be funny, it fell rather flat.  Overall, the book was cute and funny, but not one that did anything at all spiritually. Emily doesn't change the world, and this book certainly won't change anyone's life 
 For those of you out there who adore Anna May Wong (and there seem to be quite a few), or have an interest in early 20th century British musicals (!?), this should be a fun way to spend a couple of hours.  I'm neither, however, so I found it pretty tough going.  Neither the material nor the acting is particularly distinguished, and the "direction" is non-existent.  (This is one of those films that looks almost entirely made up of first takes.)  It may be a bit harsh to judge "Chu Chin Chow" by today's standards, but this WAS the era of Astaire & Rodgers, the Broadway Melody films and countless other wonderful movie musicals.  Perhaps the British film industry was less interested in financing this type of thing.  There seems to be some discrepancy amongst reviewers as to the quality of the DVD transfer.  I'm on the side of pretty awful.  I'm not sure why any distributor would go to the trouble of issuing a deluxe 3-disc (!) set of an obscure film curiosity without doing a better job of cleaning it up.  And the soundtrack is hopelessly compromised, particularly during songs, the lyrics of which fly by unintelligably.  (Subtitles would have helped a lot, but sadly they don't exist.)  All in all "Chu Chin Cow is a must see...but only if you must 
 This novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries.  In between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits.  some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they  certainly can't make up for the braindead plot.  Read some of his other novels and skip this one 
    A Virtuous Woman is a book by Kaye Gibbons and is about a woman named Ruby Pitt who meets a guy named Jack Stokes one day when he spots her sitting at a picnic table. She was much younger than he was and was raised much differently than he was.Ruby was a widow but ends up married to jack.Jack was so in love with his wife through everything they went through even when she was diagnosed with cancer.They were opposites and when Ruby dies Jack is lost without her.They seemed to have an unusual relationship in my opinion. It was actually really hard for me to keep reading each page as i went on.It just wasnt a story that kept me wanting more!and that is why i gave it only 2 stars. i didnt even want to finish the book and that is why i think it took me so long to read it.It really dissapointed me seeing as how i loved Kaye Gibbons first novel, ELLEN FOSTER.i think that another reason i didnt enjoy the book is that there were too many characters to keep track of and it made the book a bit confusing.i really didnt like the transition of chapters either. it was a bit unorganized.There was no action in this novel and i'm sad to say that i dont reccommend it to anyone really 
 These headphones are just plain horrible. Looks are very deceptive, they look great out of the box but peformance is horrible. When there is no audio and the switch is on, it creates humming and is really unfcomfortable 
 not as good as the 1st three but you need it to go with the other 4 deathwish films 
 Since Avant's debut CD, My Thoughts, I really enjoyed the songs because they combined different artists' qualities (including Joe and R. Kelly), and I really wanted another "Joe", smooth operator, kind of singer.  Well, each CD just got worse and worse, as in many cases with singers, and the end result is this: a cd full of filler songs.  The only one that I kind of enjoy is 4 Minutes.  I'm dissapointed that he's transitioning into a very mainstream singer and is sounding more and more monotonous.  Well, I guess if you can sing and dress well, you got made anyways.. 
 This is definitely one of the strangest superhero movies I've ever seen.  Daryl (Damon Wayans) and Kevin (David Alan Grier) are two brothers who grew up on watching "Batman"...and nothing else is explored with that opening scene.  Kevin has grown up to be an writer for one crazed editor.  Daryl, on the other hand, is an inventor who, of course, has dozens of ridiculous gadgets that will somehow pay off...or will they?  Yes, his tools are creative, but they serve no purpose other than comic relief, which I didn't find funny except for Daryl's embarassment.  Sadly, the two brothers' grandmother is killed because she works for a City Mayor nominee who ticked off a cliched mobster (Jon Polito).  Daryl swears revenge by dressing up in a ridiculous costume and using those odd gadgets to fight crime and build a secret hideout (which I'm surprised nobody finds since it's at the end of a train track).  Let me make this clear - there are some hysterical moments in this movie.  The bickering between straight-laced Kevin and wannabe idealist Daryl is side-splitting.  In fact, just about every scene with these two is very funny.  The problem with this movie is that it has such a dark, dramatic tone in some scenes that just doesn't fit.  For example, Blankman takes a reporter (Robin Givens, who's basically a black version of Lois Lane - that's not a racial slur) to this hideout, but there is some music that reminds me of a despressed version of Danny Elfman's score of "Edward Scissorhands," and some comedic actors trying to be serious about the world and love.  That scene is absolutely disastrous.  There's another scene when the Mayor is going to publicly open a bank and asks Blankman to be present for the dedication.  But then Polito's mobster and several thugs chain him up and set off a time-bomb that kills the Mayor, and possibly other people.  THIS IS NOT FUNNY!  The movie is not trying to have a dark sense of humor at all, but instead goes for laughs that seem like they belong in "Don't Be A Menace In South Central..."  The contrast of tones and themes don't work.  Another case in point, Blankman fights crime on his first night out and confronts a pimp slapping a woman around, but then Blankman's genius idea is "Slap me around and call me Susan!"  The scene is funny, if improbable...but seeing a woman slapped around and turned into comedic violence feels wrong to me.  Maybe I'm taking this movie too seriously, but when I see some jabs at classic superheroism that make me laugh uncontrollably (Daryl's inability to face life seriously instead of as a TV show is priceless), and then see some drama that is not only misplaced, but also horribly filmed and acted, then the potential hides itself underneath a movie that's trying to be a superhero comedy "PLUS" an urban drama "PLUS" a hip-hop flick.  This movie has a serious case of split-personality with no hope of control.  I really want to like this movie, but it strikes so many wrong notes that I can't quite recommend it

 My sixth grader came home with this book. It was found in his school library with a Reading Level of 6.7.  He told me the book contained a lot of inappropriate words.  I immediately looked at the book and in 10 minutes found a huge array of offensive, sexually explicit, and morally offensive words.  There was no warning of the mature nature of this book on the cover or the reviews inside.  THIS IS NO CHILDREN'S BOOK.  I have currently asked the middle school to review the book and send it on to an audience where it would not influence such young children.  Not my kid, not my school, NO WAY! (By the way, he did not finish the book. 
 This book is several things.  One thing it is NOT is funny.  Blount  worries that, having attained the age of 55, he is experiencing some sort  of humorist's change of life and is no longer capable of evoking guffaws.   Well, then, this book is a self-fulfilling prophesy.  In the process, we  get to squirm through such incessent dissing of his mother that we want to  turn our heads in embarrassment; so much what-did-I-do-wrong whining about  lost loves that we're inclined to "card" him to see if he's  really past 15; and yet more tired and feeble attempts at what, I suppose,  is to pass for "Southern humor."  If this is the best we're to  expect from Blount as he flounders through middle age, he ought to confine  himself to his periodic appearances with Garrison Keillor, reading jokes  sent in by people who know what "funny" really is 
 Well I finally got around to reading this one.  No surprises.  It didn't explain anything new, answer any questions, or really fill in any gaps.  At least not to me.  But, that may be because it has been years since I read the first book in this series.  If the author is going to write, prequels or sequels, that's fine, but finish the story that was started a decade and a half ago.  There are thousands of storylines which can be developed into thousands of books just from the sheer scope of this series.  But, after over 15 years and about 8,000 pages later, I'm beginning to wonder if the Wheel is going to turn, ages pass, and the series come to a conclusion before the author dies.  I also doubt whether there are going to be any readers left to buy any of those off shoots after being burnt out on waiting ad infinitum for an end to this story 
 While this Modern Library edition is attractively produced, all teachers and students who hope to use it in an academic setting should be aware that this is a severe abridgement--it represents about one-eighth of the original text from 1660-1669.  As a result, there are large gaps in continuity, exacerbated by a lack of editorial notes to fill in those gaps.  Also, the abridgement omits many of the sexiest passages and seems tailored to a Victorian sensibility.  .. 
 I started this book full of high hopes.  I too, am Italian-American and grew up in the northeast.  The synopsis of the book was quite promising - an Italian American woman who falls in love with a Jewish Man - a union not all that common in the New York/New England regions.  But when I got into the book, I started noticing that I didn't really care about the characters.  Rosa, the female protagonist, who the author wants so much to be our heroine is never all that likable.  Nothing about her character or personality ever endears her to the reader.  The male lead, Gary, who Ciresi wants so bad to portray as a great catch, complete with a kind heart and great sense of humor, comes across as boorish and obnoxious.  The supporting cast, namely the families of the two leads, don't have a memorable trait between them.  I found Ciresi's portrayal of the Italian family of Rosa to be completely offensive and insulting.  And by the way, note to Ms. Ciresi, if you are trying to portray these people as Italian immigrants, please correct the spelling and grammar of the Italian words you mix in the dialouge.  There are countless offensive stereotypes of both Jews and Italians, and Ms. Ciresi doesn't leave out the Catholics either. Plenty of material to offend them in there too.  All in all, if you are looking for good Italian-American literature, I would suggest that you look elsewhere 
 Samantha seems a lot like Becky.  A young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions.  Instead of staying at the firm and working out her "mistake," she runs away.  This is just like Becky hiding her bills.  And then she gets a totally implausible job, because she can't tell the truth - again like Becky.  Samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to.  I agree that the firm would never have taken her back; they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care.  Samatha, like Becky at times, seems somewhat manic, in that she's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation.  just like Becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared.  Lithium, anyone?  I don't have an opinion on the housewife/lawyer "controversy," but I do think Kinsella's protagonists need to grow up 
 The case looks great and fits well, but it's nearly impossible to remove.  I had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time.  I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod.  In addition, it's too wide in the case to dock in my Logitech speaker system.  I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the case off for docking 
 New York criminalist, Lincoln Rhyme, is in North Carolina to undergo surgery which he hopes will improve his quadriplegia.  A sheriff from the small town of Tanners Corner asks for his help.  A teenaged boy has been murdered and two young women kidnapped by a youth known as Insect Boy.  Rhyme, along with his protagee' and soul mate Amelia Sachs and his aide Thom, agree to help.  This is the first book by Deaver I've read and, while I am hoping it was just a bad choice,  I'm not certain I'll read another.  I really struggled to get through it.  I had no history of the principal characters and none was given.  In fact, all the characters were one dimensional, there were two many of them and stereotypes ran rampant.  I like a good twist or two in a story but this became laughable.  And let's not even talk about the ending!   I did feel Deaver did a very good job conveying the problems and frustrations of a quadriplegic, but that was the only redeeming feature.  As for the plot, the title says it all.  This rated zero on the believability scale.   
 I usually really like Anne Tyler (and I do like her consistency in telling stories about characters that are real, but not necessarily likeable) but this was my least favorite book I've read by her.  I could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life, and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made, but she just seemed to lack depth.  In a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one, this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing.  To me the main character was difficult to identify with, and I found her choices often disappointing.  I've found Anne Tyler's other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me, but I could still identify with them on some level.  There are many other Anne Tyler books that should be read before (or instead of) reading this one 
 This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL "democratic" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow 
 The author cannot seem to grasp that there is much discontent amongst the people. She swallows the Islamic doublespeak about women's rights but I'm sure she wouldn't tolerate one tenth of what Iranian women must endure. Also she is fixated on being a blonde in Iran. Weird 
 This tepid,disappointing sequel is far better than Beyond the Re-Animator but dosen't equal a good sequel to the excellent original. Dr.Herbert West and his friend Dan re-animate dead bodies and when Dan's girlfriend is dying she is re-animated just like Bride of Frankenstein. The gore effects are good including the crawling eyeball but the movie becomes tedious and more predictable as it goes along. The new director Brian Yuzna does a good job taking over Stuart Gordon but this movie fails to entertain and make watchable that this looks like a Sci/Fi channel movie that would debut on TV and the movie is just disappointing compared to the first with a new cast(Except Jeffrey Combs and Bruce Abbott),lower production values and lower budget,and tepid to atrocious acting. If you seen the first your not missing much but for some reason you can recommend this instead of Beyond the Re-Animator.  
 At first I thought that the dvd I purchased did not have any sound.  I had to put it on a certain setting to hear anything, which I thought was weird. The video has good exercises in it, but it is very boring. I can't find the motivation to watch it again. It needs to be updated. It is very "80's" 
 very similar to an officer and a gentlemen, but no passion, and this is a lousy movie.  the DVD will be in the $1 bin by the new year.  
 I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good 
 After all the good reviews, I decided to give this one a chance.  Phew.  What can I say?  Laymon's characterizations are shallow as wallpaper, and the pace of the book is plodding in the extreme.  The author piles on detail after mundane detail, often taking several sentences just to move one of his characters across a room--which would be fine, if something actually happened along the way.  I also found his character's adolescent obsession with catching glimpses of women's bras and breasts embarrassing (for him, not for me).  I agree with others here who have said that these kids seem more like 12 than 16.  I persevered to the end, though, just to see where it was all going.  Wish I could say it was worth the effort 
 Well, I have to admit that I am a self-admitted design junkie! I am familiar with most of the television designer/decorators out there and have a fair collection of books on the subject. The amount of real and useful information in this book could have easily be covered in a short magazine article. Nate is selling "Nate", not creative design, (like many others I'm sure, I was suckered in by the "image"...) Put side by side with Candice Olson's new book, which I also just bought, this one doesn't even register on the scale (and it's twice the price). Do yourself a favor and check out Candice's book first. It runs circles around this one for content, ideas, before and after photography and most of all really great design 
 What a disappointment! The music quality is very poor--most of the "intruments" sound just like every other cheap kids electronic toy.  The piano is probably the worst; the animal voices all sound the same. I thought I'd get better quality at the price, plus, the left speaker doesn't work.  My kids had a toy casio keyboard that cost $12.00 and was the size of an egg-carton, and its sound was vastly superior. I will likely have to go through the hassle of returning this. 
 This relauch disappointed me mostly because of the art.  I don't believe Kitson draws these characters as teenagers (which is pretty important).  The characters look like adults (and pretty generic ones at that) and don't convey the spark of youth or energy that I  would think would be so vital for a book about teenage superheroes in the future.  Waid's updates to the setup behind The Legion are for the most part improvements that expand and deepen the future environment and worlds represented; however, I feel the art hinders the book enough to make these enhancements incidental 
 The definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good. The user interface is quite honestly shameful. Software companies got away with this years ago, but there are now accepted standards for windows user interfaces (e.g keyboard short cuts are missing). Integration with Word 2003 is weak. Numerous bugs and exceptions and very slow 
 I'm a huge Yankee fan so I enjoyed the opportunity to remember the events of their first championship season in nearly two decades, but Sherman desperately needs an editor. The book completely lacks structure, with tangent building on tangent to form an incoherent mess. There are diamonds in the rough in the form of interesting revelations, but getting to them can be hard work indeed. 
 I love this film.  It's epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing.  I was thrilled to see it being released on DVD , UNFORTUNATELY it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used.  I have only viewed sections of the film so far but EVERY frame I have seen has surface dirt or scratches.  In one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture.  I was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves.  I'd have given 5 stars if it had, so the minus three is for the appaling print .  One of  the worst I've ever seen 
 What a waste of time, you knew all along what was going to happen and the characters are all just a little too perfect to be normal and believable.   Some things are totally out there... for exapmle, Allegra is woken up in the middle of the night to bail her client out of jail? Come on! Lawyers are not ethically permited to post bail for their clients. Do some research Danielle, like the rest of the authors do... don't rely on what you see on television. No lawyer would ever give out their home number, let alone answer calls in the middle of the night.   And I am sick and tired of this obsession this author has with thinness. A size 10 is fat? Women like to read about characters who they can relate to and are like themselves... not the ideal woman created by the male world.   Don't waste time on this book, unless you are still in high school.  
 This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it.  Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!!  It's just plain BORING!  About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.  After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable.  It's back to Roberts for me

 This book is a rehash of a number of other general management and time management principles found elsewhere, which may still be of use for a lay-person but is certainly not for project managers or anyone else who manages multiple projects for their profession. There are a number of other books on program management which are much better suited for that purpose 
 This is a nice story with lots of dramatic scenery but it is full of inconsistencies that really ruin the movie.  The main character's hair is short, then in scenes that happen a day or two later it is very long, then the next day it is short again.  When one person gets buried in the graveyard, it is located downhill by the water.  When another person gets buried in the same graveyard, it is up on top of a hill.  It is very hard to concentrate on the plot, characters, etc. when this is happening all the time.  But two stars for being a good story and having nice scenary 
 DVD's which play perfectly well on other cheap players, freeze/skip or don't play when I try to play them on the XBOX. Don't waste your money on this, buy a stand-alone DVD player instead so you won't have the frustration that I've had 
 This is garbage! Ritchie Blackmore took himself way too seriously. He left Deep Purple for this? Grown men singing about fairies, kings, dragons and the middleages? For, like, all the songs?  "Man on the Silver Mountain" is a great, classic song (it is also acts as a bait switch...great first song and then all down hill from there). The instrumental at the end is enjoyable since it showcases Blackmore's guitar playing (which is the reason why most people checked this out).  This sounds so silly and dated today. Ronnie James Dio's voice was a bad match for this muscular sound.  Sorry metal fans, this stinks!   
 This book explains about the sex selection history in the past and present and about three high tech methods, which includes the Erisson Method, PGD, and the Microsort method. So, if you want to go the high tech route on choosing the sex of your child this book may be for you, but you can also look up these methods over the internet for FREE.  If you want a good sex selection book I recemmend "How to Choose the sex of your baby" by Dr. Shettles. It talks about all the high tech and low tech methods. I bought both of these books and that one was the best 
 The analysis described in the book is a start for an individual investor to do their own research and it points to some useful resources. But the depth of the analysis and process is not enough. Following this process would not be sufficient to replace an analysis by a professional analyst, provided the analyst is objective. In other words, one can not "fire the stock analyst" simply by following what the book says.  Some criteria mentioned in the book are also abitrary, superficial. For example, it says slow growth would be sales growth of 30% or less. A sustainable of sales growth of 30% is extraordinary in real life. The book also gives different processes for growth and value investors, where growth and value should be integral parts of any analysis 
 The reason for the low rating is because this book is a repeat of Mr Garrett's book,"Let's Talk Treasure Hunting" which was first printed in 1992. Chapters and wording of "Treasure Hunting for Fun and Profit is practically identical.  If you buy either book, there is no need to buy the other. These books have some information on the technics of metal detecting, but is more focused in the end in describing the kind of metal detector to use which is the Garrett detector...which is a great metal detector 
 Inxs shouldn't have participated in this book after so many people ignored what was really wrong with Michael.  Does anyone remember in Michaels last hours all the call to and from Bob Geldof? What happened that night is left to posterity. But imagine if you will Michael is trying to run off with Bob's wife with her full acceptance, however enter the children here is the overiding factor and why Michael's new love couldn't , wouldn't come to OZ. The kids, Bob had a serious say in the disposition of the kids. Michael found out the hard way that the kids were not leaving the UK with mom when Bob(their dad) had so much infulence after doing things like championing "Live Aid". That was the relationship killer for Michael right there and he should have had the sense to see it coming. What mother wants to lose the children she loves most? None that I know of and not for a burnout like Michael became. Go to OZ and live with Michael and lose the children forever. Bob played a Royal flush that night and Michael in dispair took the long road home. This book doesn't paint this lilly white it just doesn't tell you how it really is. Although if you read factual information from other sources this contributed to another suicide and made losers of inoccent children as well. Way to go Bob I hope you can sleep at night after this. Moral of the story if you love something set it free, if it doesn't come back tell Bob and he'll talk it into killing itself. I agree with the other reviewer that mentioned Motley crew from personal experince I knew they were all 5150 material. But we live in a crazy world the rock bands and other looneys are the icing on the cak 
 I wanted to understand everything on Generics and finished the book with only a few new concepts.. 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 I have a long-standing interest in cultural issues in healthcare and so I eagerly bought this book. It's in the 3rd edition--I figured it must be good.  It is appalling! You can turn to almost any page and find a portayal of a person from a minority culture that is presented in such a way that it makes the person sound like an idiot. Not just immigrant and ethnic minority patients--immigrant medical professionals, too.   In addition, she does not modify her gross generalizations by saying, "HIGHLY OBSERVANT Muslims" or "LESS-ACCULTURATED Mexicans" or even "SOME Chinese." No, for Galanti, she generalizes about Muslims, Mexicans and Chinese, with no gradations according to people's country of origin and degrees of orthodoxy (e.g. Muslims), generations in this country, fluency in English, etc.  I am afraid this volume will perpetuate stereotypes. Yes, it may be "fun reading" for people who know nothing about the topic, but they will end up with a view of "how weird those people are!" rather than either any true cultural understanding or a better sense of how to adapt their own practice to meet their patients' needs.  i have never returned a book in my life--this is going to be the first.   For alternative choices on related topics consider: Culture & Clinical Care (Lipson & Dibble) Ethnicity & Family THerapy (McGoldrick) Child Abuse & Culture: Working with diverse families (Fontes) The spirit Catches You and YOu Fall Down (Fadiman).  Stay away from this one 
 A tank this small should only be used for a Betta fish. Any other fish will need a good filter, heat, and oxygenation. And still it is way to small to even be worth it. My advice to you is to save your money, and go buy a 10 gallon kit and have that as your starter aquarium. Then you can keep some realy fish. Also goldfish should be kept in at least a 30 gallon aquarium, so i even if you get a 10 gallon, please research the fish before you buy them 
 I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.  Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing.  The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along.  By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one 
 Ms. Begoun should be commended for her massive research but I found her information biased, and her opinions flip-flop from chapter to chapter.I did not understand her vicious attack on companies that produce natural and organic products, especially one particular organic company so I did a little more digging. She has her own haircare line which is full of all the things she says are bad for your hair. Her book seems to seeks to discredit any companies that make great products that do not use the chemicals she uses.  She also makes a very ridiculous statement about black hair in its natural state not being an acceptable fashion statement. Yet later in the chapter she asks the question why these women allow themselves to be slaves to fashion styles such as braiding, cornrowing, and weaving. Her lack of new, accurate, or real information for black haircare probably could have been the catalyst for several black and multi-ethnic haircare website showing up offering real tried and true products she did not review (probably because they don't have all the chemicals she loves, or are so unlike many of the black haircare products she reviewed.) Her book aggravated me because she seems to hide her opinions behind supposed scientific research 
 I learned a lot of information about Kepler, Kepler's family, the thirty-years war, and the counter-reformation. The writer's prose was very readable; however, the book lacked cohesion. The book had very little information concerning with Kepler developing his scientific theories and his search for harmony. The author jumped off on bunny trails for scores of pages without mentioning Kepler. He would write about the thirty years war and the political machinations that led up to it. He would then return to the witch trial of Kepler's mother. He would then breifly spend a little time on Kepler developing his theories and how it relates to his faith. The book seemed repetitious at times. Maybe bacause the witch trial went on for so long, but the book returns again and again to that same topic and how worried and frantic Kepler was.  I had a hard time finishing it. The book was a hard read. At the end, I had a hard time placing  all the pieces together. The topic was fascinating and the author did provide some interesting tidbits, but the narrative thread was hard to follow 
 There are times when this book goes off on a tangen. Sometimes I actually forgot that the book was about fressmasonry because it rambles on about things in way too much insignificant detail.  Also, some of the investigation into the historical aspect of the reasearch unjustly discredits the many things that have already been proven by scholars and archeologist. Overall, I think the authors came to their conclusions about history because they found what they wanted to find and made sense out of things that was most convenient for them. It is sort of like looking for a cloud in the shape of an animal...if you look hard enough you will find it. I was not as dissapointed when I learned that neither of these authors has a background in history, research, or the arts. One is in advertisement while the other is an engineer ?????? My recommendation is to look for publications written by those in their respective fields 
 THERE WAS A CRACK DOWN THE SIDE WHERE IT WAS PUT TOGETHER AND NICKS IN THE WOOD. WE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO SEND IT BACK AND THEY ONLY OFFERED US 20.OO FOR A DISCOUNT. VERY DISSASTISFIED! WILL NEVER ORDER FORM HERE AGAI 
 I haven't been able to read it yet because THE PRINT IS SO SMALL! That's the only thing I can base my review on. I'm sure it's a fine book if you can read it 
 I would like to buy one of these products from Wine Country Gift Baskets but I cannot find a description of what is actually in each one 
 This has to be one of the most simplistic books I have ever read.  It reminds me of one of those biographies written by a not-to-bright athelete "as told to" a mediocre small town newspaper writer.  I think that Ms Garrett wrote the book because she needed money. Derek Bloomfiel 
 There's no one complete song on this album. I was fooled and hope my advise may prevent others from falling in this trap. I love Pink Floyd and hoped to listen and see they perform but nothing like that happens in this DVD 
 I am surprised to see so many people think highly of this book. I have a startup for a new software product and am trying to bootstrap (to raise VC money you still need paying clients). I read this book some months back and was disappointed. Two false things stuck out even now:  1) dont prototype, pre-sell your idea. This may work for service type companies, but may not work for products. Why? as you build the prototype, you will innovate and the end product will be unrecognizable from the idea at the start. This was my case. I had to build my prototype. The customer doesnt know what he wants until it is laid out in front of him.  2) exploit your employees. He didnt say it explicitly or would have been sued for age discrimination, but he says, hire people without much experience, and full of energy ie. young. Then make them work long hours for cheap. I have seen a big name (top three) consulting company deliberately do this strategy and burn their people out. Sorry, that is not how I plan to build my business!  The best book for startups is Kawasaki's "Art of the Start". Skip this book 
 I bought this recording with high hopes.  What better complement to reading Shakespeare than hearing him, right?  Well, not with this recording.  The cast is made up of "distinguished actors," the insert proclaims, but it's obvious that these actors haven't done Shakespeare since they were in junior high school.  Nor have they improved since then: none of the actors has any feel for the Shakespearean line.  The speaking is stiff and mechanical, and half the time it sounds like a Monty Python farce!  When there are no visual effects to distract us, low-quality acting really sticks out.  For audio recordings, you need the best voices.  Too bad Arkangel didn't realize this.  My advice?  Grind up these CDs and use them to fertilize your nasturtiums 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal

 More ignorant ramblings from someone who hasn't done any research, which is typical of the rabid Christian 
 I am a fan of utopian literature. It is a great measure of the human soul that we have these books. The spur us on to better ideals.  Sadly, we have abandoned these, replacing them with the ugly dystopian literature, and are worse of.  "Herland" is unique in that it is feminist utopianism.  It is so off-beast that I was excited to read it.  All of the classical cannon of Utopian Lit is all male: Plato, Moore, Bellamy, and so forth.  I was curious about what insights Gilman would have.  Sadly, I felt left down.  First of all,  having so many expectation for a book, and then being let down forced me to look deeper at what was going on. I had to reexamine my assumptions and expectations.  I realized that so much Utopian Lit is the same: people getting together, decided to stop being fools (in the Biblical sense of the word), and  actually doing what then should be doing.  Part of templette involves uniform clothing, large mess halls, centralized planning, and the un-Biblical open marriages.  Gilman covers all of theses, except the open marriages, which I will later cover.  In fact, there was nothing really new in this book.  This is not to discredit it, but to to convey the epiphany I had while reading it.  The utopias all have common elements, with minor modifications.  The problem with Gilman's book is in the virgin births to perpetuate her Amazon society.  This dues ex machina fatally shifts the story form Utopian Lit to mere fantasy.  All Utopian Lit must, of necessity, be atheistic. Otherwise, it becomes religious social philosophy.  There are some other problems, some of which come from outdated science.  For example, genetically, all the women would be identical, and the environmental conditioning would not change them.  Gilman has them with different features (p. 76, 78), a genetic impossibility.  Another problem is the centralized planning without omniscience and omnipotence.  "The best laid plans of mice and men . . ." We cannot control nature, predict earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or predict hurricanes.  Herland has none of these. It is a peach of an Eden, but detached from the real world.  Centralized planning never works.  We have limited knowledge.  And even if we know something, we have limited capacity to change things. We have Murphy's Law, entropy, and  Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.   Couple all of these with the Butterfly Effect of our ignorance and impotence, and it is a wonder that anything gets done at all.  I so not want to get into Praeto's 80-20 Law, except to mention that all utopianists, except the American Founders, completely ignore this principle, Gilman not excluded.   Most confusing is the birth control alluded to in Chapter 6 (p. 60).  If pregnancies are virgin, are they spontaneous, and if so, how does one control them?  This all comes back to the fact that this book is essentially fantasy, and not utopian.  Sometimes Gilman gets downright ridiculous, as in mentioning that babies do not cry (p, 88). I understand the miracle eugenics and "negative eugenics" (p. 59), but this is ridiculous. Crying is not an annoyance, but serves several purposes, and is the root of communication.  The religion is a disappointment.  It is just Social Gospel, but no power. It has virgin births, but no Virgin Mary.   Another problem is the nature of evil.  Gilman notes that "They had  no theory of the opposition of good and evil" (p. 87). That smacks of Nietzscheism, and is fundamentally at variance not only with the Laws of Logic, but also common-day experience.  By virtue of creating a Herland, she is setting women in opposition to men.  That is , she believes that society of Amazons is good, and mixing it with men is evil.  Aristotle said,  "There are some, however, as we have said, who both state themselves that the same thing can be and not be, and say that it is possible to hold this view. Many even of the physicists adopt this theory. But we have just assumed that it is impossible at once to be and not to be, and by this means we have proved that this is the most certain of all principles . . ."  "If all contradictory predications of the same subject at the same time are true, clearly all things will be one. For if it is equally possible either to affirm or deny anything of anything, the same thing will be a trireme and a wall and a man; which is what necessarily follows for those who hold the theory of Protagoras. For if anyone thinks that a man is not a trireme, he is clearly not a trireme; and so he also is a trireme if the contradictory statement is true.  And the result is the dictum of Anaxagoras, "all things mixed together""(Metaphysics, Book IV.4)  Herland is not Eden-it is a Fool's Paradise.  It is not practical, relies on a dues ex machine to function, and naive.  The most corrosive ideas is that men are not only unnecessary, but the chief cause of the problems in the world.  This is unabashed sexism, and ignored the fact that men are out there, and have things to contribute.  This is as radical as any male chauvinistic nonsense. Changing the genders does not confuse anyone.  If we were to implement Herland, what would be Gilman's final solution to the Man question?  She does not say-perhaps for the better.  Gilman is a pseudo-utopian. This book is not utopian, but more of feminist fantasy, which is just as bad a the male fantasies seen on cable TV.  I recommend this book merely as a literary curiosity, and not as a blueprint. 
 It's bad...pretty bad. And dull. I was expecting something different from this....it's almost unbearable to watch 
 I bought this 18 months ago and while I had some problems with the set up, I got help from the store where I bought it.  It has really nice sound, but it has a serious problem: not once but TWICE, when my children inserted DVDs in the player they would NOT eject!  Since no one could service it locally (I went to 3 places, and each claimed they could fix it but then later admitted they couldn't since they would have had to open it up), I had to send it to Bose.  That cost a lot, plus Bose charges a minimum of about $240 (I forget the exact amount) to even look at it.  Now, the exact same thing has happened (this is the second episode)!  They say you can repair this easily but I went through the recommended procedures with a Bose technician over the phone and it didn't work.   There's NO WAY I'm sending this machine back to them; I'm getting something else!  Any recommendations?  Finally, lest you think the kids are somehow to blame, let me note that they work daily with other DVDs, CD-roms, CD players, and personal computers and have never had any problems with any of them.  I normally don't like having to pay extra for a warranty, but if you insist on getting this product, I'd recommend buying it from a place that sells it with a warranty 
 While the author does a decent job summarizing someone else's work, the look and content of this title is a clear attempt to cash in on the popularity of the books and films.  Within its pages, you'll find reproductions of "Teen Beat" style magazine covers featuring the movies' stars, and quickly see that the material covered is far from comprehensive.  A much better choice for a book of this nature is Fionna Boyle's "A Muggle's Guide to the Wizarding World," also available through amazon.com 
 I didn't know that they made music videos this long. If I had known that's all that this was, I would never have watched it. THIS IS A HORRIBLE FILM! SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AND AVOID THIS MONSTROSITY! 
 I watched the first 15 minutes of movie. Thanks quarantino, I bought this for 20 bucks, I won't recover my money if I want to sell it. I want my money back now. Nobody will buy this vomit. All quarantino's movies suck. Do me a favor Quentin: change your profession to a cleaner or something like that... You may do it better. PS: the only star is because Amazon doesn't give me other choice. I would give this movie "-5 
 I have been a loyal user of blender for a 6 years now and I decided to purchase this guide to ultilize the fullness of the software. Blender is a very powerful program that has boundless features and I expected the book to cover aspects I haven't explored. However, the book amount to a spurious assortment of Internet tutorials that wasn't specifically written for in depth coverage. The writter even says, "we have tired to collect as many tutorials and microguides as possible." The book is 247 pages. Take out the the blown up illustration, which are mostly concept art that doesn't pertain to the material, you get a skimpy dictionary with words used out of context. After reading this book, you won't know blender any better than before. This book was a disappointment. The fact is, the book lack developed examples and scope of coverage. It's good for a brochure on blender. Although it includes the Blender software version 2.0, it's absolete. You can download V 2.42 online for free. It has new features and a more intuitive interface. Try looking at Blender 2.3 guide instead. I am planning to buy it, but hopefully it will be worth the money 
 I would imagine the discs are good. i was very excited to listen to it on christmas morning. Disc Two seems good, I wouldn't know about disc one as I opened this on Christmas day to find two of disc 2. Nice 
 This is my 3rd Nora Roberts book.  I've read the first 2 in the 3 Sisters trilogy, and decided to read Chesapeake Blue while I (very eagerly) await Face the Fire in the mail.  Perhaps I was spoiled by the characters, the conflicts, and the love stories in 3 Sisters, but this book pales in comparison.  The Quinns are meant to be a family whose perfect and deep love for one another is tempered by a course and affectionate manly banter.  Sort of like 7th Heaven meets a beer commercial.  Anyways, Seth is supremely talented, handsome, kind, and sizzling in the sack; in other words, a stock Nora Roberts male character.  Alas, he is also entirely thick-headed, vain, and has the mental processes of a mule when faced with his "problem", which he only exacerbates over the course of the book.  So he has a floozy of a mother who blackmails him into huge sums of money on pain of, what, her leaking a story to the press which, once she removes all the parts that reflect poorly on her, would be about 2 sentences long?  And, he can't tell his troubles to his family that he loves "so" much?  I mean, I wouldn't tell Cam anything myself, because he seems to deal with every moment of emotion by pitching someone off the end of a pier in a fit of manly love.  But Anna and the rest seem like good candidates for a chat.  Finally, Drusilla.  First, the name makes her sound like a villian in a Disney movie.  Second, she is flat as a pancake, and I would pay for problems like hers.  At the very end, she exhibits a spark of life, and sort of morphs into another stock Nora Roberts stock character: the sassy, smart, no-nonsense, gal who steps up to defend her man.  Which, I like that character.  In my limited experience, Nora Roberts writes female friendships and falling in love brilliantly, but her male friendships need a few less put-downs and jaws clenched to supress brotherly emotion.  And, I agree with the other reviewers who wanted Seth to end up with Aubrey.  
 If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy 
 Just not a good book.  Not very well written.  No real insight, lessons learned, etc.  Just not worth reading 
 I liked the book well enough to read past the first 100 pages, and I did enjoy the Scholar's Tale, but beyond that this book really failed to satisfy.  I don't want to give away any details, but I will say that all of the excitement and mystery surrounding the Shrike is NOT satisfied at all by the end of this book.  Presumably it's wrapped in in the next book but I found myself not interested in slogging through more of Simmons's half-baked plot to reach satisfaction.  I felt cheated 
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 The book [...] me in and left me disappointed.  Atwood had some great ideas, but they never got developed.  There are dozens of dangling story lines and unanswered questions that it seems are never addressed because Atwood didn't know where they were leading.  Having an open ending is fine, but slapping together a bunch of unanswered questions and undeveloped plot lines just shows how poorly conceived this book was 
 The book sucked.  Pages were missing or out of order.  I returned one and the replacement was the same way.  I just gave up after that 
 This is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid.  It's easy enough to install but hello!  What's to stop anybody, especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together?  Not a thing!  The "kit" that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it's closed, it doesn't fit snuggly around the seat so it's completely loose.  Total and complete piece of junk!! 
 Since the total carbs are what is important for diabetics, this should not be recommended. It has 42 grams of carbs and only 4 grams of fiber per 1/2 cup of cooked pasta. This is almost the total amount of carbs allowed diabetics for a complete meal. Only 1/2 cup is the maximum of carbs for a meal. Who  can eat just one cup of pasta? It is very misleading to diabetics as "digestible carbs" has no meaning to them. Total carbs less fiber is what counts to a diabetic. Thus diabetics beware. If you want to eat it remember, 1/2 cup is a complete meal of carbs 
 but this abridgement is the poorest that I have ever heard or read. There were many elements left out of the story, including some that were mentioned on the cover! With all the missing elements of the story, I'm sure there were nuances that were totally missed, leaving just a fair story with no build up or satisfying resolution. What remained was a "B" grade short story, making me very cautious to ever buy another abridgement. If you like Robin Cook, and want to hear this audio book, I strongly suggest you listen to the unabridged version. It most definitely has to be much better! 
 James Patterson is one of my favorite authors, but I'm sorry to say, this book really isn't one of his best. It's awfully boring and the characters really aren't very interesting. I've had a hard time even finishing it. Usually, I can't stand to put one of his books down!  For action adventure, I'd suggest reading any of his books with (one of his best characters) Alex Cross in them, or When The Wind Blows and continuation of this story with The Lake House. Suzanne's Diary for Nicolas for a really great, touching story too. Everyone who I've lent it too loves it 
 In ordering the PACKAGE for Theory and Practice of Counseling and Psychotherapy by Gerald Corey, I entered the ISBN # for the PACKAGE. I had declined several options for the HARDCOVER ONLY because I wanted the PACKAGE including the Student Manual.  I received the shipment in a fairly timely manner. HOWEVER, I was only sent the HARDCOVER!  I paid $10 more than I could have gotten that single book for locally right across the street from my college!  I ended up having to order the manual separately from another seller.   I was unable to contact seller because name given did not match what was on the shipment.  My serenity is worth more than a $10 fight!  I would not use this seller again 
 Why am I supposed to be gripped by the drama of this personal tale?  I cannot get past the first pages, so full of history that I am completely bogged down in it. Is all this necessary to my understanding of the situation in that part of the world -- one which I watched unfold during the years it happened as I watched and listened to the media reports? Please, please, I want to like this book, but it just puts me to sleep.  Maybe I should skip the first part that lays the groundwork and get to the personal experience part.  Can I do that??? 
 I bought this book thinking that it would be something different and interesting.  I like fairy stories but the book was so not what I expected.  It was more the story of a bunch of dirty little children that go out and kidnap other children and take their places so they can live boring lives in which they are so bored with their own existence they have to go in search of the lives they had before they were originally stolen to become dirty little children.  Not really interesting, very little plot, extremely predictable, and a stupid ending.  My friend and I read this at the same time and we both agreed it was not worth the money 
 When I saw this on the shelf at Wal-Mart, I thought..."Here we go again...another greatest hits collection."  All of these songs have been released time and time again in various other collections.  A few years ago when Elv1s 30 #1 Hits came out, I bought it.  A few years later 2nd to None came out and I bought that.  HOWEVER, HitStory arrived, I was shocked to see it being nothing more than the previous 2 collections sold with a new CD.  Why would I spend money on CDs I already have?  This is not to say that the King's music is not important...IT IS THE BEST.  But why spend money on something you already own 
 Great disappointment. Plugged in this equipment and tried typing in all the applications I own (Excel, Word, FreeHand among others) and displayed typed numbers (when it did) with extra spaces and squared characters. Should specify in the product description that is NOT MAC compatible. I'm not aware if PC users faced this problem as well 
 But it was better when it was originally written as "The Last Convertible" by Anton Myrer 
 If you must watch this film, watch it for Winkler, who gives an interesting preview of his future role in "Arrested Development".  Watching this movie for "Prinz" and "Stiles" is counterproductive.  Not only have the actors "failed to make the best" of the script, the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich Hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences.  Thus, we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school, muse about becoming "singer-songwriters", and "stop paying attention" to their college plans.  Much like the "Friends" genre that this movie shamelessly imitates, this is a "time porn" piece, where the characters have little else to do besides "mature romantically" and "find themselves".  A movie for history's circular file 
 Believe it or not, I had actually expected to hate this because it just doesn't suit me for the good kind of music. It sounds just the way I thought it would sound: crappy. It isn't hard enough to be all that good if you ask me. It is just too calm. {And now you probably think I'm a hypocrite because I like Enya}. At least Enya doesn't sound like someone who sounds like they are in a garage band attempting to record bad music. Not my style. 
 I received the Bjc-85 portable printer. I have plugged it into many electrical outletts in my home and office. The item will not turn on . I was sold a broken printer. I am very unhappy with this product 
 I'm always looking for ways to make coding work better, at any level from nanosecond arithmetic operations to decade-long enterprise operations. I didn't find much of use here, but there were a few good points here (very few). Let me start with those.  The "Execute Around Method" pattern is good idea, applicable far beyond this Smalltalk context. The Beta language has "inner" inheritance, which makes the idea easy, but most other languages lack a good mechanism for undefined logic between matched operation pairs (open/close, setup/cleanup, etc.) "Enumeration" is another good one, enshrined as "Visitor" in the Gang of Four book.  Most of what's left is either trivial or Smalltalk-specific and face it, Smalltalk is mostly a cult language with nearly no commercial significance. The Smalltalk pretty-printing and variable-naming rules, fatuous at best, are just not applicable to most langages. Some of Beck's "practices" are language features (like 'super'). Other "practices", like the long chapter on Collections, seem to describe standard library classes and messages. Yet others (e.g. Type Suggesting Parameter Name) correct language defects - Smalltalk chose to give up the error detection capability offered by variable typing. Beck tries to sneak it back in with variable naming conventions sort of like Microsoft's old Hungarian naming. Some of his suggestions are just dangerous, like that one that says a constructor should "half-way construct an object in one place, then pass it off to another to finish construction. (p.23)" This distributes an object's setup responsibility across its client classes, leaves unusable and incomplete objects floating around, and causes subtle exposures in multithreaded systems - I'd rip out any code I saw built this way.   The good news is that no new trees died to make my copy of this book - I got it used, and it's returning to the used market. At least my conscience is clean on that account, no matter what I'm doing to the poor guy who buys this book next.  //wiredweir 
 Being a Saudi Arabian woman, I was totally amazed by the false information in this book. I don't think the author should write a book about a country when she lived there for few months. She missinterpreted so many things that happen regularly in our culture. She should know that women in Saudi Arabia choose to cover up. They are not forced to do so. The same thing goes to Catholic nuns, who choose to cover up for the sake of God. I think she should have talked to more educated Saudi women who could explain things better. She may have lived in a village where the majority were uneducated (that was in 1970's) and women were less fortunate. I'm currently working as an IT consultant in a huge company, my mother is a college professor and my father is really supportive and is proud of both of us. Nothing is stopping us from reaching our goals. I think people should look at a broader picture. I could have judged Americans by the acts of the KKK few decades ago. However, I lived in the US for two years with my husband, who is an engineer, and I had a chance to make good American friends. I cannot say all Americans are racists!! In concolusion, the book is a total waste of money. I do not recommend that anyone should buy it 
 I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories.  This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing.  There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult.  I felt like I was in the "fog of war", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end.  Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?  
 It starts out like Laura Bush's Rules for Driving, but skydives after the opening pages, in which the then 17-year-old Laura kills a young man with her car, who just coincidentally happens to be her boyfriend!    My interest in the book sharply dove after that, as it appears that coincidental killing is the most appealing thing about Laura Bush 
 The title may be "Chassis Engineering", but this is really just another suspension tuning book, with almost no real information about vehicle chassis (frame and frame reinforcing).  I purchased this book looking for something about reinforcing the frame of a unibody vehicle, and found that the first 85 pages  and last 36 pages are the same shock, spring, aerodynamic, and weight distribution stuff as every other suspension tuning written in the last 25 years, basically rephrasing everything from Fred Phun's "How to Make Your Car Handle" (1981) (And Mr. Phun presents the material a lot better).  There are only 12 pages about the "chassis" or non-moving parts of the vehicle, and those really present the subject with such lack of detail and depth that anyone beyond the age of about 10 is going to be disappointed and feel talked down to.  I suppose the good news is that it was only $12, which minimizes the waste of money 
 "I can't believe they named me after that book--it's so sexist!" After Amelie, where she was a delight, as well as open-minded, AT should have passed on this loser!   Political correctness is just intolerance by another name! But you can't tell a liberal that! It's bad here in USA but I suppose the French must be the worst? They have fined Bardot for merely expressing her opinions that muslims are barbaric! Talk about intolerant.   
 This film is just like the The Sixth Sense film.  Both films have the same borring plot.  THE BORRING PLOT. In the two movies they have 2 boys who can see and speak to ghosts and in the 2 movies there are 2 teenagers girls who are ghosts who want help and showing the boy and man the people who had kill them.  After the boy and the man shows and tells other people who has killed the 2 teenagers, the two teenager girls ghosts are happy and they are at pease at last.   The Sixth Sense and this film is deserve to be seen only one time and after that you dont want to see again.  If you are like me and love ghosts who are bad and evil and kills people, you will love 13 Ghosts.  That film is what I called a good ghost film 
 This book and the great mass of the photos relate not to the garage, ie, a covered space where cars are stored or where a hobbyist workshop is located, but converted space or living space above a garage.  If you're interested in creative garage layout, workshop arrangement, automobile-related storage, etc., this is not the book.  If your desire is to turn a hardworking garage into a granny flat, this is for you 
 When this product was ordered it was to be a 9 1/2 Wide when it was recieved it was a 9 1/2 Medium. We live in South America and they were brought by some friends and now we have shoes that don't fit in a different country 
 Whenever you think of Disney films, you typically think of cutesy, happy-go-lucky 80 minute comedy musicals with pop culture jokes to appeal to adults and a sappy ending to make the kids happy, but Disney's The Hunchback Of Notre Dame is quite different from that.  It's surprisingly a much more darker and more serious film than Disney's usual cartoons.  Although none of it is ever graphic, there is a surprising amount of on-screen deaths for a G rated Disney cartoon.  The movie also deals with several adult subjects like racism, persucution, and even religion.  The film is mostly serious but there are some comical moments performed by Quasimodo's gargoyle friends.  Unfortunately, as funny as the gargoyles are, none of them were really all that memorable and I actually find myself having trouble remembering any of their names and while they did have their laughable moments, there were also times were I felt like their presence felt intrusive, especially in the later more dramatic moments of the story.  I didn't like how they had the gargoyles help fend off the soldiers near the end of the film, either.  What made the gargoyles tolerable is that they were kept seperate from the rest of the "real world" of the story and were only used when Quasimodo was alone, as part of his imagination.  By having them fight the soldiers, it feels like Disney is trying to mesh the realisim of the story with the fantasy elements, which works fine with most of their other films, but feels really out of place in this more serious movie.  It's like Disney wants to push the G rating as much as possible, but they aren't brave enough to truly make this a dark film, so they had the gargoyles included to lighten things up for the kiddies.  Perhaps if this movie was rated PG instead, Disney would've been more free to explore the darker sides of this story and the gargoyles could've been used a lot less.    Aside from Qausimodo, most of the other characters feel very Disney stereotypical.  Esmeralda is your average spunky Disney heroine, Phoebus is the typical dashing Disney hero with a big head who falls in love with the heroine, and Frollo is Scar from The Lion King in human form.  Despite a rather small cast of characters compared to Disney's other films, very little development is given to any of them aside from Qausimodo.  I couldn't really connect with any of the other supporting characters because not enough time was spent developing them and it didn't help that most of their personalities are Disney stereotypes.  The Hunchback Of Notre Dame also lacks that magical sense of wonder that other Disney movies have.  The storyline is entertaining but you just don't really feel drawn into it.    The Hunchback Of Notre Dame does have some gorgeous animation, though.  I loved the detail designs of the churches and this film has some of Disney's most stunning animation, easily rivaling any of their classics in the visuals department.  The background music is beautiful as well, but other than "Out There" and "Hellfire", most of their songs are pretty forgettable, and even those two noteable tunes get rather old after a while.  Don't get me wrong; The Hunchback Of Notre Dame is far from being a bad film and I enjoyed it a lot.  I loved how Disney attempted to show a darker side for a change, Qausimodo is one of their more likeable heroes and one that anybody who's been a social outcast can easily relate to, and the animation is gorgeous, but the film just doesn't connect to the viewer and some of the comedy scenes felt very out of place.  Still, older viewers who think they're too grown up for Disney's more childish movies but still love animation will enjoy this film, and diehard Disney fans will want to add this movie into their collection, but casual moviegoers should pass this up and stick to something like Beauty And The Beast instead, and most of this film will probably be uninteresting to younger viewers due to its lack of magical fuzzy creatures and its more serious undertones. 
 Now that Hannity has gone on the record as a pedofilia apologist and defender of child molestation.   "Thank God for Hannity!" -Lee Krock, founder of NAMBL 
   Where's the editing in this book?  While a memoir, by definition, presents facts (or not!) filtered through the author's memory, bias and interpretation, an editor or reviewer should still reflect upon the writing skills and organization offered to the reader.  Unfortunately, Ms. Salinger offered the minutiae of her personal and family history in a way that was to the point in describing her tortured childhood, but often tediously anecdotal, and quite often ambiguous (did her mother beat her or was Peggy's memory lapse just that?  Was Peggy clairvoyant? Was she her brother's protector or did she hate him initially as suggested by her father's comment?).  Overall, the book suffers from a lack of structure and too many writing approaches - sometimes comic slang, sometimes well-written philosophical interpretation.  It would be difficult to sum up Ms. Salinger's overall personal writing style.  She almost sadly seems to attempt to copy her father's style at times.  Her best approach, to me, is in the final section where she seems to combine both directness with deep, creative insight into her past and the characters inhabiting it.     Those looking for details of J. D.'s life and motivation should not expect to rely upon this memoir for facts.  Either this accounting by Ms. Salinger was mis-advertised as such or, in my opinion, missed it's mark.  The book is about Margaret Salinger, not J.D., and, as such, presents her journey from a perceived troubled childhood, through the not-so-unique emotional upheaval of adolescence - popularity, note-passing, boyfriends, some miserable teachers and loneliness (a la Holden Caulfield?), serious emotional and physical disabilities, to a final level of personal peace and acceptance of the fact that she apparently had miserable parents.   References to J.D. Salinger's writing were most often inserted into multitudes of footnotes, interrupting what written flow there was, but were haphazardly left in the text in other instances for no distinguishable reason.  An ambitious initial and insightful attempt to relate Mr. Salinger's life's events to his motivation seemed to dwindle away as the memoir continued.  Disappointment over this tactic arises not so much from the loss of interpretation but to the overall lack of focus and structure. 
 They have managed to insert negative value into the classic film rendering the video worthless. Well done 
 Sorry, I have to disagree.  I was disappointed with this album.  I have been a fan since she started.  I saw her kick Rick James A-- on stage way, way back there.  This album, while it has it's moments (God Has Created is my favorite) seems to pander to the younger crowd much too much.  Technically, the music and execution was very well done.  But the lyrics convinced me NOT to listen to this again.  While I understand the desire to win a new audience and get sales, Teena is NOT a gangster, no matter how she tries to convince you of this.  Never has been, never will 
 Seinfeld's gaffe on this DVD is one we've all made, and not surprising considering his adulation of Bill Cosby.  The scene is backstage with Bill Cosby and Cosby expounds on how amazing it is to be him (note HIM) at this late stage of his career. He eventually says something like "there you are among the greats like Willie Mays, Hank Aaron ..." etc. and Jerry thinks the "you" in the sentence means Jerry! It makes him so happy! It made me squirm when I watched the regular version and I wondered why they left that in, but then I watched Jerry's commentary version and he again (as in the film) said how appreciative he was of Cosby's high praise... UGH!!!!! I can only think that having lots of money stupefies the people around you into having no thoughts other than your own. Or could it be meanness on the part of those who could have set him straight 
 I do not understand how this no talent loser ever made a career out of the slop mislabeled music. Honestly I have no beef with "The Boss" other than the fact that I cannot stand terrible music, and this is most certainly *the worst* music ever made PERIOD.... Everything about it sucks.  1) The Songwriting The songs have no melody whatsoever. There are no memorable hooks, nothing to grab onto melodically, which is pretty important considering he is considered a songwriter. Additionally for those of you that try to compare him to Dylan by using the defense that Bruce's music is more about the lyrics...Don't even try that with me. Bob Dylan is a lyrical genius. Bruce's lyrics are nothing but cliched psuedo-patriotic atrocities. Give me a break "wrap your arms around my engines" haha. And thats probably his best song by far Born to Run that is. It really pisses me off people could even Compare Dylan and Springsteen....thats like comparing The Beatles to The Backstreet Boys... 2) The Musicianship The E street band is the epitome of all that is wrong with sell-out commerical bands blaaaahh. Horrible sappy piano parts (walking in memphis) Disgusting Sax solos....Not cool.  3) The Production Values Please tell me who thought that deeply tuned heavily reverbed snare drum sounds good? Good grief that is irritating....Every single song all you hear is smack, smack, smack, smack....There is more to a drum kit than a snare that sounds like it was sampled from some of the worst 80 hair metal bands....  In Summary Without one doubt in my mind Bruce Springsteen is the single worst artist in modern music..His songs were written for unsophiticated people who have even less taste in music than the average Contemporary Country listener. His music was made for those people who have not only terrible taste in music but have the mentality of jingoistic ROTC brainwashed 14 year olds. 
 the very thesis of this book is disturbing, and added with the fact that some people are ignorant enough to believe it is just shocking.  my grandparents are survivors of Auschwitz and have the tatoos to prove it, they lived through the nightmare along with many many others- including elie wiesel, who wrote/spoke extensively about his experiences at the hands of the nazis.  that anyone would actually believe this anti-genocidal propoganda is beyond me, should we next begin to disbelieve that the rwandan genocide happened? what about pol pots slaughter of millions?  this book is not worth any history teachers-such as myself- time, no matter how much you want to look at all sides of the picture to paint an authentic historical scene for your students.  
 I've read this book twice through.  It is  a dreadful piece of hack work.  The stories Franklin presents as exemplary (his!) are awful.  And the last chapter, "The Nature of Art and Artists" is frankly bizarre.  Avoid this one like the plague.  Pick up Zinsser, Tarsis, Joseph Williams, or any of a number of others 
 My SECOND review, as my first did not get printed (AS USUAL).  Anyway, I'll try to make this short and sweet.  I usually try and give credits to directors, producers, writers, and actors in most of my movie reviews; however, I'm going to make an exception here.  I've read other reviews that have called this gigantic turd "hilarious", "Night of the Living Dead + money + color", "wonderful for gorehounds", etc., etc., etc.  All I can say is it must not take much to please you people.  This is, WITHOUT A DOUBT, the WORST excuse for a movie I've ever seen.  (My most humble apologies to Tobe Hooper and "Mortuary").  The whiners of horror movies are always moaning and groaning, "why don't critics take horror movies more seriously?".  Well, Einstein, here's a glowing example.  This is nothing but grade D trash:  horrible effects, horrible acting, horrible writing, horrible directing.  You name it; it's NOT in there.  This movie's most FEEBLE attempts at humor come off as just that:  feeble.  I bought this, together with "Dead and Breakfast", and I can't begin to tell you which one is worse.  So, here's a little advice from me:  go check out a book at the library, buy a book, go to a REAL movie, have your hair done, have a manicure--do ANYTHING but waste your time on this gag-fest (for all the WRONG reasons) of a movie.  Another one that I would give ZERO stars to, if I could. 
 A compendium of feminist misandry.  Anti-men myth piled on bigoted propaganda.  There is so little truth or fact and so much misandry in this book that there is no place to start describing it.  If you're into self congratulating feminazi hate this book is for you 
 I purchased this mount to hang a 15" LCD TV, weighing less than 9 pounds (the specifications rate it up to 33 lbs).  I carefully measured and used a level to mount the swing arm on the wall, but when I hung the TV, the position of the arms and the small amount of "give" between the arm segments caused the TV to hang at a slight, but noticable, angle.  You can tighten the arm segment joints, which helps the problem somewhat, but you won't be able to swing the arm around once tightened.  The swivel adjustments only allow you to change the side-to-side angle and the vertical tilt, there is no way to fix the rotation of the set. 
 I would not recommend this product.  When I plugged it in, it would not stop chirping.  The directions said it might chirp "a few times" while powering up, but the thing chirped all day.  Also, the 9 volt battery that came with the product did not fit into the battery compartment.  The company that I bought it from told me to just throw it away, although I did receive a full refund. 
 I also wonder why the author has named the book "Web Development with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005" although it just covers the Visual Web Developer, and just a very shor part is about VS 2005. I wanted to know how to put the application on the production server, especially how to transfer the database through VS to the server, but it's not possible to find even a small hint there. I am disappointed and sorry about wasting my time and mony for this book and find the author irresponsible for the wrong entitling his book and spoofing the people.  Regards 
 Boring and out of touch describes this book by Santorum.  I am a Republican, and I can honestly say that I am glad he is out of office 
 Thirteen Ghosts is about a machine. This machine was designed by a Man who was at the time possessed my Satan. Yes, Satan. If the plot doesn't seem stupid enough, it needs Ghosts to power it. Ghostbusters anyone? At the start we watch a ghost hunting scene with a ghost that looks it belongs in a Michael J Fox movie.  As time progresses you find out that the 'demonic machine' needs to be powered by ghosts. If done right, it opens the 'Eye to Hell'.  Save yourself a few bucks and don't rent this.  It's awfu 
 it was the wrong book for a class i needed. Didn't even open it 
 Europe is bad, America is good, Number One , best of the world, uniquely great...Well, that is all there is to it here. This book is a constant insult to the intelligence of the reader, whether he be conservative or liberal, given the absurd violence and anger of the tone. Interestingly enough however, as others have pointed out, Rabkin's true haunting fear is not about the European Union, but rather American progressives willing to claim American ideals for the cause of peace and justice 
 Hwere we have a guilty concience trying to make himself feel better by justifying in helping a murder go free. The arguemnnts are weak and stupid and do nothing to refute the overwhelming blood evidence. What is more is that after the criminal trial so much additional evidence has been exposed that only proves even more how guilty this man is.  A few reviewers seem rather confused.  One reviewer suggested that mark fuhrman discovered both gloves. Not true! The glove at the bundy crime scene was in full view of numerous police officals before fhurman even showed up. Those gloves were a rare isotoner product of which only 240 extra lg were sold at one store in the united states. Bloomingdales in ny and credit card receipts prove that OJ owned 2 pair. I wonder how many other los angelas residents owned any of those 240 pairs of gloves sold 4 years ago in new york? Not many? Where would mark fhurman even get a pair of he wanted them and how in the hell did he know OJ's glove size?  Another reviewer suggested the crime was commited at 11:15 which is interesting because simpson's own defense team suggested the murders took place around 10:40. The discrepancy of time comes from when witnesses heard nicole's dark frantically barking. Witnesses saw nicoles dog barking nonstop with blood on her chest area at around 10:30-10:40. Where did the blood come from if ther murders have not been commited yet?   That same lame brained reviewer also said that OJ had nary a scratch on him. Really? What about the severe cut on his left middle finger that bled all over his property? In simpson's interview with police the next day he actually volunteers that he cut himself getting something out of his car. Cut himself at around the exact time the murders were commited? What a one in a million coincidence.  What about all of OJs blood at the crime scene? What about ron and nicole's blood in OJ's bronco? What about blood from all three on the rockingham property? Who was that running behind OJ's house bumping into the airconditioner at around 10:45 if it wasn't OJ frantically returning from the murders? Who was that 6 foot 200 lb black man the limo driver identified as walking into OJ's house at around 10:50?    Only idiots and the ignorant blind can honestly claim that OJ is innocent. If dershowitz needs to clean his concience he should talk to a rabbi.      .......socks  
 I didn't realise how awful these movies were - when I think we used to really look forward to seeing these stinkers at the show - guess our senses have matured 
 Hello People wake up How Many times can the same 3 children escape 1 bad guy?!? this Book was horrid! Boring, Boring, Boring, After the 5th book i was snoring and this tops it all its not even the last one!!!!! After 12 books its still not over, my grandchildren will be reading the100th book if he continues like this! (and between me and you, what kind of a person cant recognize a baby in a conciarge outfit)I dont plan to even bother to read the 13th book, i can see lemony saying the series will continue after the book "The end" if there was a 0 star i would give it!! 
 I had always liked this movie.  Any time it was on, I would watch it because I enjoyed the music and because, despite the bad acting, it still had a really good story.  Until...  Until I turned back to traditional Judaism in my 30's.  This movie sends a CLEAR message to a Jew - "Lighten up and enjoy the secular world.  It ain't so bad."  I grew to hate the fact that Olivier's character (as Diamond's father) strove against Diamond's desires to forego his Jewish identity in search of a temporal pop dream.  And Diamond wins!    When a movie champions secular idealogies removing a Jew from his roots and assimilating him into secular society, it can't help but make a traditional Jew very very sad... 
 I normally like chick lit, but this book was disappointing.  The situations rang false (even though they were based on the author's actual experiences), and the characters just didn't seem real.  The constant mention of Majuro got annoying.  I stayed with it only to see what happened, and the ending was satisfying.  But this was not one of those books where I was sad to leave the characters when I closed the cover 
 Most military histories of the American Revolution focus on the "great" battles, and give scant attention to recounting other, lesser engagements. However, those lesser engagements are often the best way of depicting the harsh and divisive nature of the war. In the Carolinas, for example, the war took on many aspects of a civil war within a war, as Loyalist militias, stiffened by British soldiers, took on Rebel militias in a brutal, back-country partisan conflict.   This book attempts to describe that slice of the war by highlighting one engagement within it. That small battle, prosaically named "Huck's Defeat" (after Captain Christian Huck, the Loyalist officer who lost his life in the fight), was the first Rebel victory in the aftermath of the fall of the city of Charleston, and it is the opinion of the author that the importance small militia engagements like this one are overlooked. Huck's Defeat, and several subsequent victories by partisans and militia units, convinced most locals to side with the Rebel forces and oppose the English. This, in turn, kept South Carolina in the war, and ultimately led to the Rebel victories of King's Mountain and the Cowpens. The rest, as they say, is history: the British were forced to leave the state, marching down a path that led to Lord Cornwallis's surrender at Yorktown.   While making a good point - that these lesser back-country battles were important and are often neglected - Edgar overstates his case. "Huck's Defeat" was a very small battle indeed: 115 Loyalist and British soldiers vs. ca. 250 Rebels, and lasting no more than an hour. The loyalists were massacred, but unless the Revolutionary cause in South Carolina truly hinged on this one engagement (i.e. defeat would have meant the end of resistance in the colony), then it was simply one particularly bloody skirmish among many 
 Please think this DVD is recorded in 1986. More worse, this is recorded as a documentary. Sound quality is worst. After I bought this and DVD of "Company" (same, worst sound quality DOCUMENTARY), I suspect the word "concert" or "soundtrack" in DVD title 
 Than this poorly written, haphazard history.  The photos aren't even coffee book table quality and are often so cropped as to delete important features that the author may have actually described.  This is not for a serious historical reader or for a photo composition review.  It fails on all counts 
 I bought this book after using the Girlfriend's Guide to Baby Gear.  I was impressed with the book.  As a first time mom, the guide was great in a sea of baby items that I didn't have much of a clue about.  Saved me lots of time and money.  I bought this book used with the expectation that it would be in the same vein as the baby gear guide.  I want my $6 and my time back.  What a monumental waste of trees and time.  This book was so bad that I threw it away-didn't even make the Goodwill pile.  She denegrates men to the point you wonder if she's either a hard-core, man-hating lesbian or has *that* terrible of a marriage.  With comments like "of course you'll be the only one watching the baby!  Your hubby will be so clueless that you'll want to snatch the baby from him before he can harm it!"  It is heavily laced with mom martyrdome.  No thanks.     Do not waste your money on this book 
 I have read several of Nicholas Sparks' books, but this one was different for me.  It was a very very slow start.  I was more than 150 pages into it before I got interested in the plot.  I had even considered quitting reading it at times.  It ended up being an okay story, but nothing that I couldn't have lived without reading.  What I did enjoy is the way Mr. Sparks writes about male characters in the romantic way women wish men really were.  I would suggest another read from Mr. Sparks like "The Notebook" or "The Wedding" if you want a good romantic read.  
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 Very slow book, very predictable, oddly written (sometimes I had to reread a sentence a few times just because it sounded so odd). 
 Ms Rose is without a doubt a talented writer, but her work here is tediously self-indulgent and trite and sheds very little light on Proust, or indeed on his effect on her. Give it a miss and read the master! I don't think I'll be visiting Ms Rose's other work anytime soon.. 
 The information  on this DVD is good  but the actual production of the DVD is rubbish.  The sound quality is very average and his voice seems to be  rushed and muffled in parts.  Also is is very hard to pick out what he is playing without slowing the DVD down.He seems to rush over important bits.  I have the book as well and the two compliment each other .  
 this is another story that I don't know if I like it or not because Amazon.com never sent it too me.  this has happened about 4/5 times.  While usually I have no problem getting movies, sometimes I do.  sending them e-mails doesn't seem to work.  If they didn't have the best prices for movies, I'd leave 
 This was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen. The author really needs to go back to school and learn how to spell and punctuate. He even calls World War 3 WWWIII all throughout the book! Then to top it all off, at the end of the book he has a debate with himself on what you would do if you had the knowledge of an impending event and doesn't even finish the debate. It's like he just gave up or got tired and ended the book. Don't waste you time or money with this one 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook 
 This book was quite disapointing to me. The author did the usual competent job one finds in all the Osprey military books of giving us all the basic technical information on the type. Weight, horsepower, dimensions, top speed. All the manufacturing information including various dead-end predecessors and subtypes. Even a nice chart comparing the penetration of the gun with other rivals (17 pounder, German 75mm's etc.)    Thing is, all that basic data can be easily found in the internet from any number of sources. Even the ballistics info exists in every halfway decent wargame or WW II tactical computer Sim out there, and have been around since before the days of Squad Leader.  Personally, I was looking for something a bit more in depth, and of this there was only the barest taste.  Anyone who has ever really plunged into the gritty technical details of the U.S. ground forces experience in World War II is well aware of this conundrum: looking at the data dispassionately, certainly on paper, virtually all of the U.S. tactical equipment, especially armored vehicles, seem to be MARKEDLY inferior to their German counterparts.   This is especially true later in the war as the US introduced new types at a snails pace while the Germans fielded one terrifying new ubertank after another. A Sherman wasn't just worse than a Panther, or a Jadgpanther, or a Tiger, even an 8.8 centimeter AA gun, it was COMPLETELY outmatched. Unless terrain was really to their advantage (allowing close-in fighting and lots of opportunities for point blank flanking shots) the Sherman, (and the various even more hopeless British types like the Crusader or the Cromwell say), were simply incapable of coping with German Heavy tanks or AT guns.  Thats why events like operation Goodwood happened over and over again, where 30 and 40 Shermans got knocked out in a matter of minutes for no gain.  And you simply can't attribute every single Allied victory to superior numbers or Air Support or even Artillery.  There has to be something more to it.  One of the apparent secrets to allied successes appear to have been these relatively unknown U.S. Tank Destroyers, which seem in spite of a very flawed basic design policy and tactical doctrine (leading among other things to the lack of a bow or coaxial machine gun and extremely vulnerable open topped turrets... for essentially arbitrary reasons) seemed on several occasions to reverse the usual trend and knock out very large numbers of German tanks, including Heavy tanks, for relatively few losses.  The M-18 is one of the greatest among these mysteries. VERY lightly armored, with essentially the same gun as the other older M-10 TD and the later model Shermans, cursed with the infamous open topped turret, it's single remarkable attribute seemed to be it's extremely high speed and excellent automotive performance. And yet they were apparently loved by many of their crews (unlike Shermans!) and if U.S. statistics can be believed they seem to have done extremely well against German Armor, actually having one of the lowest loss rates of all US Armored vehicles. (Though I think these stats have yet to be cross-checked with German records even now...)   As a history nut and avid wargamer, what I was hoping to find in this book was some clue as to why it worked out this way, and precicely how this was done... exactly what tactics did they use, more specific than vaguely describing them as "hit and run...?" what kind of terrain did they prefer to fight in, we know their road speed approached 50 mph but how good was their cross country performance? Did it have any special gun sights?  How fast was the turret traverse, what was the rate of fire of the gun, and how accurate was the gun? How did these factors compare to other vehicles of the day?  How many shots did they normally fire before retiring, did they coordinate attacks from many directions simultaneously or rely on surprise to get their flank shots?  I found no ansewers to any of these kind of questions here, just a few more tantalizing statistics about more apparent Hellcat victories agains the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge and some other engagements. Instead, the Author seems to contradict his own data by insisting that the M-18 was a bad design and any successes were attributable to the great training and skill of their troops. Which is a nice patriotic thing to say and my hats off to all those guys, but it doesn't explain why Shermans seemed to suffer 5 losses for every one kill while according to his own book M-18's did perhaps 1 loss for 3 kills. Were M-18 crews better trained? If so, why?  The M-18 was a very contraversial design and the Generals in the increasingly discredited TD corps were basically drummed out of service for having so many bad ideas. But maybe they were on to something after all? It's a major mystery of WW II which has not been cleared up here, thats for certain. Personally if this book is ever re-issued or replaced, I could do without some of the stuff about M-18 use in the Pacific, or the never used one-offs, and a bit more about how it contributed to winning the war against the Germans in Europe.  D 
 I was really looking forward to this book, since I heard glowing reviews about it. However, I found it to be perhaps the most excruciating reading experience of my life thus far (with the exception of mathematics texts), and I wish I could've given it 0 stars. I don't mind it when authors digress a bit from the story to reflect on a theme or two, but Wilde did it so often it seemed like I was reading a 100+ page philosophy essay on art. I think Wilde is a fantastic writer with an almost perfect sense of wit, and I think he had a good story, but something went wrong when he was writing the manuscript and he ended up making this novel a university lecture for his beliefs 
 This DVD is edited from the original version.  This movie is HOT, the cut DVD is NOT 
 This is a great story, I highly recommend it. However, this recording is a digital voice reading it, so it completely takes away from the story. I love audiobooks, but this one was unlistenable. It was like having bonzibuddy read hamlet 
 Years of trusting Chicago Cutlery went down the drain with this purchase. How the company could risk its reputation for quality by putting out such a poor product is beyond me.   The wood knife holder is fine.  The handles are smooth and well finished. The knife blades are a complete and total disaster.  The so-called "STAINLESS" steel is really a poor quality carbon steel.  I have the distinct feeling that my set was unfinished, as the serrated edges were so rough that slicing meats or even a tomato ended up with a tearing of the food.  I finally used a sharpener to take the unfinished edges down a little.  That worked, but seems dumb that they came out of the factory unfinished. The blades are very heavy whch may seem like a feature, but because the serrations are only on one side, when you try to cut, the angle of the blade edge causes the blade to turn , and prevents even cuts. The worst part, is the rust.  I note that after I bought the item, the term "hand wash" was added to the descriptive copy.  Even hand washing and drying did not prevent rust, and then of course, if the rust is allowed to remain for any time... pitting takes place. My wife bought the set at Christmas from Kmart... supposedly a $59.95 value for $29.95.  Hey... I was happy... a set of Chicago, at a great price.  Not to be... I have thrown away the original box, but don't recall anything on the box or the descriptive card that was included that said the set was imported from China.  Usually, when this is the case, the words "made in China" are imbedded in the blade.  Not so.  The blade has only the embossed "Chicago" brand. I used to work near the Chicago headquarters, and knew some of the workers, who had pride in their product. That was then, this is now...   They say you get what you pay for.  In this case, I must tell you that I bought a similar set for our cabin, with a few less steak knives, but the same basic carving knives... no wood knife holder but a nice wood cutting board.  The set doesn't rust, cuts better, and the best part is that it had a day in, day out price of a flat $8.00.  The stamped brand was "Gourmet Traditions", and the "made in China" stamp WAS on the blade.  We gave our "Classic" set away to Goodwill, with a warning that it wasn't worth more than $5-8.00  "Chicago Cutlery" made an enemy of me...  You can only trade on a magnificent reputation 'til your old customers catch on. 
 I managed to read The Breaker in one sitting, so it can't have been all that bad. But it was a pretty unremarkable story. There wasn't really much of a mystery to uncover. I had a major problem with the character of Maggie. What was she even doing in this story? Easily the most annoying character I have ever encountered in a book. Making it worse was the fact she practically had nothing to do with the plot.  I have also read The Dark Room by Minette Walters, and found that one to be fairly average as well. She needs to work on her character development. Her writing style has more of a presence than her characters do. I doubt I will be picking up anymore by this author. 
 In a quest to find the perfect chocolate chip cookie, I followed this recipe with enthusiasm and excitement.  When I served them, the expression on everybody's face was more than I needed to know, they were absolutely the most disgusting chocolate chip cookies I had ever tasted!  Not only did the batches of cookies go in the garbage, so did the book.  
 One has to wonder if she really wasn't mad . . in her unfathomable feeling for her less than stellar husband.  He was able to find water cooled by ice some 500 years ago, and as soon as he started drinking glass after glass of it, one knew that there was something in that water that would do him in.  And seeing the Spanish nobles so anxious to take the crown from their legitimate Queen made no sense . . . there were too many unanswered questions, and too obvious shifts in plot to make this anything more than a pleasant view of early sixteenth century fashions and mores.  It was not a very good story, not very good history either, and I would not recommend it 
 I watched this film as part of my history studies in Post-War Europe and before everyone docks me because I gave it two stars, hear me out.  I'm no Godard fan so I may not be able to appreciate this film as a fan of The New Wave might.  I'm just your regular Joe Movie-Watcher.  Masculin Feminin is about Paul, a 21-year-old French citizen that just retired from his 16 months in the Army.  Paul is a believer in Marxism and throughout the film promotes the Worker's Party while denouncing US involvement in Vietnam, the Du Gaulle government and most forms of Westernism such as condoms, psychadelic rock (many songs in Masculin Feminin have a style similar to The Kinks, Jefferson Airplane etc) and even Coca-Cola... yet Paul is often seen playing pinball and that mini-bowling game you see at an arcade.  Paul seems to be the pro-French identity kind of guy as he often eats cheese and drinks wine.  The preserver of the romanticized French culture.    However, Paul's friends and interviewees (Paul works for the IFOP, the major French polling agency at the time) seem to not care about the change towards a quasi-American consumer state.  Paul's girlfriend Madelein is a rising pop-singer, her room mates are materialistic consumers, one who owns a car, and the people Paul interviews seem to only care about themselves.  This is very accurate in terms of how the 'baby-boom' generation of French youth began to rebel against the traditionalist governments in Europe.  Like the teens in the 1950s in the US, the teens began to form their own demographic.  However, this is where my fascination ends.  Godard apparently never heard of music editing and film editing.  In many parts in the movie, Godard fixed the camera on one person's face in a portrait shot and kept it there for minutes at a time even though the scene was a 15-minute back and forth conversation.  The volume in the music went from very high to very low instantly in many parts during dialogue, making it very annoying if almost distracting to the audience.    In a few parts when Paul was whistling, the recording of the whistling obviously overloaded the sound buffer as I heard static in the speakers.  I thought this was a volume problem on my end so I turned it down, nope... it was the sound editing.  This is just poor recording and editing.  Furthermore, the sound editors had this fascination with using the same gun-noise sound (which sounded more like a cartoon car noise) over and over and over again and in very unlikely times.    Other times, ambiant noises would drown out the dialogue such as vehicles from outside a cafe or even drinking noises.  Sometimes the sound didn't kick in for up to five seconds into the scene.    Because this is a French New Wave film, I won't attack how there is virtually no plot and has random scenes that are just plain silly.  However, I strongly recomend not getting this film if you're just in the general audience and not a New Wave fan.  Otherwise, you might like this New Wave classic but I'm no expert on the subject.  I was just extremely disapointed with the lazy filming, recording and editing.  
 When I watched this movie, I have to say, I thought it was pretty pointless.  Napolean Dynamite is, too, but it's funny.  This isn't quite up to Dynamite standards, I'm afraid.  It's not as squeaky clean as good ol' Napolean, either.  Don't buy it.  If you must see it, rent it 
 Certainly not AC/DC - this is a quick cash-in record. On this soundtrack to Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive, we get three crappy new songs (Title track, instrumentals D.T. and Chase the Ace), as well as a selection of songs that can be found elsewhere: the even-worse Sink the Pink and Shake Your Foundations (Both off of Fly on the Wall) as well as a few older, much-better AC/DC tunes (Ride On, You Shook Me All Night Long, Hells Bells, For Those About to Rock) that are best heard on their original albums (yes, this is worse than For Those About to Rock). And I know that this is supposed to be a pseudo-compilation. In that case, more from the Bon Scott era would be necessary. Avoid. 
 while i liked some interesting facts,i was shocked at her advocating killing sparrows and happy at starlings killed, killing wild animals just cause we dont like them is not right and shouldnt be glorified-or ecommended!not thier fault thier born here,  shocked at this approach 
 This book is certainly not for amatures.  This book was so full of technical mumbo jumbo and wiring diagrams that I thought I needed a degree in electrical enginering to understand.  This book is NOT for beginers.  The true content of the book is there but it's garbled and hard to, for an amature to understand and I personally have installed a stereo in my own car and was very confused.  If you can interpret electrical diagrams and can deal with the lack of color, pictures, common language, clearly defined definition,  you may enjoy this book but if you dont then definetly look elsewher 
 I was very excited about this book before I started to read it.  Polk appeared to have flawless credentials...surely someone with so much relevent experience would produce an outstanding book on Iraq.  Unfortunately it became clear very early on in this book that my expectations were not to be met.  Let's start witht the obvious.  The subtitle of this book begins as "the whole sweep of Iraqi history..."  The book is 213 pages and even that can be deceiving...physically, the book is very small and the typesetting appears larger than average.  To be sure, no single book could adequately present the whole sweep of Iraqi history, but of all the Iraqi history books I have read or referenced, this book does the poorest job of all in terms of presenting an overview of the country.  I would recommend Anderson and Stansfield's book as an example of one of the best books in this area.  The way Polk has the book organized, it would be reasonable to have high hopes.  There are six chapters: Ancient Iraq, Islamic Iraq, British Iraq, Revolutionary Iraq, American Iraq, and Whose Iraq?  He appears to have the important bases covered, but within these chapters lies a remarkably weak and half-hearted presentation of Iraq's history, at least at the governmental level.  Another somewhat related criticism would be that there are next to no cited sources in the entire book.  From an academic standpoint, this is baffling.  His experience in the field notwithstanding, it is unacceptable to produce what is to be a serious history book and then provide no sources or bibliography.  The key here is to recognize that at its heart, this book is not an attepmt to provide a history of Iraq, but merely an outlet for criticizing the way the U.S. (particularly Bush) has handled Iraq.  Onto that criticism:  Polk is one of those authors that rightly and (mostly) accurately points out all of the bad things the U.S. has done when it comes to Iraq.  From a moral or humanitarian perspective, of course it's wrong to give support to someone like Hussein.  I think most people would agree with that.  What baffles me is that someone could so passionately point out all these bad things and then be so opposed to a war that ultimately removed a regime who surived up to that point because of what the U.S. had done.  Even though it was not the reason given, the U.S. had accumulated quite a large moral debt to Iraq.  In short, we owed it to Iraqis to get rid of Saddam.  Further explanations of this type of thinking can be found in Feldman's "What we owe Iraq," and Cushman's "A Matter of Principle."  My last main complaint about this book is that for all the criticizing and lamenting about U.S. intentions and mistakes (and believe me, these are all warranted), Polk offers no real ideas for what to do to help Iraqis build a better future, and more importantly, he never even touches on the topic of what kind of life these people would have endured if Hussein was still in power today.  I think it's important and necessary to call the U.S. on its mistakes, but at the end of the day, the U.S. actually helped get rid of a dictator this time.  And even though we owe this to a lot of other countries, I can only be glad that humanitarian and security interests were aligned in this case, and that for all the other problems, there is at least a chance for democracy and a better life in Iraq.  That chance certainly did not exist under Hussein.  The biggest let down here is that it is important for people to understand Iraq, but this book I believe, is doing more harm than good.  If you've done a fair amount of reading on Iraq, this will be clear so that's not the danger here.  What would be an absolute tragedy here would be for someone with no prior experience to pick up this book and then think they have a real understanding of Iraq after reading it.  These are the types of books that make my job as a professor harder than it should be because I have to spend so much time in order to defuse all numbers of students who read material like this and base their opinions and judgements from it.  While not nearly as damaging to the process of education and understanding as Michael Moore or Sean Hannity, it is much more disappointing because Polk has the education and experience needed to produce stellar work.  Framed in those terms, this book is largely a failure 
 When I first got this camera, I was satisfied.  It is complicated to use (definitely not intuitive) because it does so much with so few buttons that you need to scroll through endless screens at time sto do what you want.  However, it took pretty good pictures.  However, soon after the warranty expired, it began to overexpose pictures and we couldn't stop it from doing that.  We tried to contact Fuji but have gotten no response.  My wife found that this is a common problem (overeposure and lack of response from Fuji), which is probably why they have a lot of refurbished ones to sell.  Hopefully, they have fixed the problem but I wouldn't bet my money on it.  This camera has given us more frustration than it is worth 
 I was disappointed, after reading several reviews that implied this is a scary movie that has been overlooked by the general public.  I'm a fan of made for tv 70's scary movies, and love movies that have things that go bump in the night, or hauntings, or scary old houses.  This movie was basically more psychological, and not scary at all.  The so-called surprise ending was not developed enough to make sense.  The directing was  poor, and all in all, I'm so frustrated that I spent money on this film.  It's priced at only 4.99 now, so that may be worth it, if the shipping is free.  It's cheaper than renting it, but you'll probobly never want to watch it again, so why own it 
 I undertook to read this book because an introduction to Mary Barton, the first novel of Mrs. Glaskell, mentioned this book as the first novel of Charles Kingsley and suggested it was worth reading.  I cannot see how anyone could enjoy reading this awful book.  The story it tells is really inane, I thought, tho I know one should make allowances for the period in which it was written.  But we all know Dickens wrote in the same time period and his works still enthrall readers.  I cannot imagine anyone being enthralled by this work.  It does not help that Kingsley for entirely gratuituous reasons periodically snarls at what he calls "papists" with obvious bigotry. Towards the end there is a long chapter devoted to telling of a dream Alton Locke had, which I only was able to keep reading because I was determined to finish the book, since I seldom quit reading a book once I have decided, wisely or unwisely, to read it.  Unless you are going to write a thesis or something on Kingsley you will be glad you did not decide to read this book 
 After hearing so much about the book, I must admit to a disappointment in its contents.  As a Belgian that has immigrated to the USA, I am well familiar with the many contrasts between Europe and the US and found Mr. Reid's observations to be lacking both in perspective and completeness.  For example, Mr Reid appears enamored with the European welfare state, vaunts its many virtues and describes it as a central pillar of the new "European identity" that is superior to the barbarous American model, but admits in small print in its Appendix that the European welfare state faces a crisis that far surpasses the US social security system in magnitude and will not survive in its present form.  I felt that a fair discussion on the topic should have included a discussion on the countless challenges to the welfare state.  I thought that many of his other observations lacked the same kind of roundness.  I felt that the book lack depths and was primarily suitable to a reader in search of a caricature on the relationship between Europe and America. 
 ...but the movie was just plain stupid. Don't waste your time 
 Another ripoff, make sure you order expedited shipping or the next edition may be out by the time you order this one. but don't be fooled there is a lot of great material in this new edition.  A lot has changed in business in 2 years.  Students: enjoy the book.  Authors and publishers and dumb professors who keep using the new edition: enjoy screwing broke college students over.  : 
 Book is useful for a few of the templates you can copy.  Otherwise, it's full of a LOT of reading, just to try to get organized...  Not at all what I expected

 I'm surprised that no-one has commented on the overly complicated knitting/purling method used in this book.    The book shows only one way to make a knit/purl stitch, and it's slow and torturous.  You insert the right needle into the stitch as you normally would when knitting or purling, but then you hold the point where the needles intersect, pick up the working yarn with your free hand and wind it around the needle.  Then you pick up both needles again and complete the stitch as usual.  This method would frustrate any child, enough to get them to stop knitting altogether 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 Save your money or give it to charity. This is one of the worst films for a long time. The characters are one-dimensional, you don't care who they are and when they die, you're indifferent. The direction and the screenplay are lame and the acting comes right out of a telephone directory. I was so bored with this film that I can't even bring myself to write anything else about it 
 I bought this item with great expectations but was disappointed enough to return it today.  One big caveat on performance however, I am running an older 800 single processor Mac G4, which, although I use it in a professional graphics capacity every day (Photoshop), is a bit pokey by todays standards. After downloading Tiger 10.4.6 which is required for the tooldail app. I got the thing going. This is what I found  1)  Evan after setting all the Tooldial prefs to the fastest speed I got slow and jerky navigation w/ the nav ring... Overshooting the area I wanted to see because of a delayed response.  Also, to pan upwards on the page requires reaching over the top of this 2 inch tall device to press (with a firm pressure), on the far side of the ring, which requires a repositioning of the entire hand.  Poor ergonomiics in my opinion, seems like they went for a sexy look/concept instead.  2) An Ipod type dialing motion is fine on an Ipod,  but on this device took many rapid circles on top of the tooldial to effect much change in Brush size etc. and seemed much less sensitive and intuitive than a rub strip on a music synthisizer or a waacom pressure pad.  3)  The trigger points funtion, but require surprisingly  heavy pressure to operate,  at least 6 to 7 times the pressure of a mouse click. This kind of treatment 8 Hours a day would send my aging wrists to the glue factory within a week....  There may be a device out there that will someday "revolutionize my workflow", but this isnt it, Back it goes... 
  The characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting. An effort to watch. Make-up, dyed hair, costumes poorly done. One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene.   The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: "His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving". This line is an exception to a lifeless script.  There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: "No man suffers pains of love on the stage." For dealing with the infatuated man: "You have wounded yourself, but not with love."   This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way.   Well-made period romance films are: "Pride & Prejudice 2005, 1996, & 1940", "Wives & Daughters", "North & South". Fairly made is "Under the Greenwood Tree". I rated "Persuasion" at 2-stars for the wooden acting; however "Persuasion" is 5-stars compared to this "Mansfield Park". "Persuasion" has attractive scenery, costumes, beautiful singing, and an uplifting plot; though of interest only to women, preferably who have already read the book.  
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 Allan Bloom, the late translator of Plato's Republic and professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago, has assembled a partially cranky, but never the less insightful critical examination of the American University system in the post-60's era. His assessment predictably reeks of the stuffy conservatism of his mentor Leo Strauss, but that should not deter one from confronting his arguments. The American university, in his perception, is inundated with transitory cultural and political problems; the academy (in Plato's conception), must continually strive towards the good, it must teach what is eternal and beautiful and drop the multi-culturalism and relativism of the postmodern era. Bloom is distraught about the preponderance of German philosophy in the academy, a Nietzschean rejection of morality and a Heideggerian rejection of the impact of the individual. Bloom's knowledge of history and philosophy is fair, and his arguments are not totally grounded in neo-conservatism (he rejects the legitimacy of the MBA), yet at the same time his book often comes across as an old man's rant. He does not value the creativity and individuality of the student intellect, and he may ultimately just be afraid of the black panthers. On the contrary, I suspect that his concerns may be more relevant today as the popularity of the liberal arts degree has lessened, and superficial non-fields such as feminism and multi-culturalism appear to have grounded their place in the academy for good. 
 The advices in this book are very blend. This book is far inferior when compared to books like "Advice for a young investigator" or "A PhD is not enough. 
 The current, non-DirecTV system, updated by satellite, is actually 7.1 (as of 9 August 2005). I haven't found that any of the hacking books are especialy useful for Series 2 boxes, especially as the software upgrades 
 The only thing good about this item is that it is cheap. It was able to somewhat straighten my incredibly curly, thick hair but that was only after going over the same sections of hair numerous times. In the end my hair would still come out somewhat curled, frizzy and puffy. This straightener is somewhat heavy to hold and the plates do not get hot enough 
 I just couldn't get into this book.  The writing just wasn't my style, and I didn't find the jokes funny...  Oh well 
 It made my breasts look funny, it made my nipples more irritable & it left painful marks on my breasts. Hardly ever used it. : 
 Book is decently written and information logically presented. However, it does not really provide adequate details for application of techniques.  It indicates that basic obedience is the fundamental method of correcting dogs who show aggression, but does not give adequate in-depth specifics to support the title's promise 
 Mixed race relationships are a big issue today.  The recent imbroglio over Sen. Strom Thurmond's half Black daughter reveals the interest in the subject.  Professor Randall Kennedy's book, however,is simply a string of stories that already have been told.  Although well written, the book lacks a common thread and it reads like a lengthy monologue about interracial relationships.  I find Rachel Moran's book Interracial Intimacy, with which I do not agree with on many points, much more thoughtful, enlightening, and challenging intellectually.  Unlike Kennedy, Moran looks well beyond Black/white relationships.  In this way, Kennedy appears to have been caught in a time warp 
 I guess I am the only reviewer who found this book tedious and banal.  It's more a series of thumbnail biographies of pga tour players, linked together through weekly accounts of pga tour stops, than anything else.  Feinstein's writing seems to move along at a brisk enough pace, but after several chapters, I found one event starting to blend into the next, one Q school qualifier after another, one harrowing tournament finish after another, and so on, and so on.  Feinstein's writing verges on being formulaic- it's all written in a sort of breathless, anxiety filled pace, as the nail biting details of who's missing the cut, who's choking under pressure, whose marriage is on the rocks, who's in danger of returning to Q school all gets mixed together in a swill of golf gossip and insider minutia.  What I found missing in this harried chronicle is any sign of the transcendental joy that marks golf at it's best.  It's almost as if Feinstein writes to show us how miserable and unbearably tense the world of professional golf is.  While some of the details he provides are interesting, overall I found the book repetitive and lacking in the sort of poetry that the best sports writing sometimes achieves 
 I looked at all the recent 5 star ratings to see what other books these people have reviewed. Guess what! The only books they have reviewed are this one or other DeMark books.. 
 This book is wordy, sappy, and lacks any sense of pace or suspense.  This was one of the few books that I have ever had to will myself to finish, hoping that it would get better.  It never did.  I have an old copy of this that was my father's when he was a child.  After seeing "Braveheart", I thought I would try this version of William Wallace's life.  I regret that I did.  The authors manage to take an exciting, heroic life like Wallace's and bury it under plodding, 19th-century prose that sucks all the excitement out of the story.  Not that I have anything against 19th-century writing -- I think Melville and Dostoyevsky are brilliant.  And I have no problems with long novels -- I truely enjoyed "Midnight's Children" by Salman Rushdie and "Focault's Pendulum" by Umberto Eco.  This book, however, could be half the length.  The authors do not cram the book with historical fact, or any worthwhile information.  Instead, they waste words on uninspired descriptions of scenes that do little to further the plot.  What is worse, I felt nothing for the characters, not even Wallace.  It is pretty bad when a heroic figure like that can be rendered so two-dimentionally.  It was a few years ago when I read this book and now find that the story and the characters are largely forgettable.  By contrast, I read The Lord of the Rings 20 years ago and I remember it all in vivid detail.  Don't waste your time with this book.  The illustrations by Wyeth are fantastic.  Otherwise, forget it 
 I was totally ready for this book when I read it back in 1989.  I very much believed in consulting my inner wisdom in most matters and was ready to believe that would work with food as well.  Who wouldn't want to hear that you can eat all your favorite foods-even an entire carrot cake-if you crave it?  Sounded like a dream come true.  But the authors did not consider the bio-chemical grip of sugar addiction.  Sugar is not a nutritive substance, so cravings for it are NEVER a signal of a bodily need.  In my case, and the case of many sugar addicts, we want sugar for the same reason that a smoker wants a cigarette:  X number of hours have passed since the last fix and it is time for another one!  There need be no emotional trigger.  I need my first sugar fix the minute I get up, in the form of a big glob of honey in my tea, when I am barely conscious.    I spent a long time trying to find emotional reasons for my sugar cravings, only to conclude that sugar, for me, is like a drug and I crave it for the simple reason that my body is used to it.  A better, healthier approach is found in Kathleen DesMaisons "Potatoes Not Prozac."  Neither can I concur with the authors'  unconcern over extra pounds.  Obesity exacts a terrible social, emotional and medical toll, and simply "deciding" to be okay with extra pounds doesn't make the risk of diabetes, heart disease and cancer go away.   These women have taken an excessively feminist approach that emphasizes accepting our bodies as they are, fashion magazines be damned-never mind that obesity is a DISEASE.  It is ugly because disease is ugly, just like varicose veins, a dowager's hump, and eczema are ugly.    I think that "The Zone," "South Beach," and "Potatoes Not Prozac," are on the right track-lots of low glycemic foods to keep insulin and blood sugar both low, is the key to ending cravings and naturally losing weight.  Food is not just about emotion-there is a big bio-chemical component to consider.   
 It is sad that this is what passes for political commentary now.  Coulter's work demonstrates exactly the potential danger for degrading society and disdain for thinking that people like Ms. Coulter piously/hypocritically rail against.  She will happily take the same formula to the bank time and again.  Why must political discussion turn to childish name calling in order to convince self-selected audiences of something they already want to believe.   Pitiful rants here.  If you are in it for fun or don't care that you are getting a skewed, sensationalist opinion, maybe you should read a few paragraphs of this in the book store.  But for something better, why not go for an intelligent book that takes an even handed, analytical approach, rather than buy into the opinions of a new breed of political analyst (on both right and left) that race to produce the most extreme charactures of any political philosophy they do not happen to agree with.   
 Susan Pulaski is a royal mess.  Recently widowed and alcoholic, the Las Vegas Police Department relieved her and the city of her duties as a police psychologist.  After all, the dear lady had enough klinkers in her thinker that had to be hammered out first.  A psychotic serial killer is on the loose and it takes a person with savantism, an extremely rare form of autism to help Ms. Pulaski "get into the mind of the killer" and anticipate the killer's next move.  I for one am quite sick of stories that portray autistics as being savants.  Since savantism affects less than 10% of the autistic population, it is sadly ironic that it has become such a stereotype.  As for the autistic character, being the child of Ms. Pulaski's former boss didn't hurt either.  All in all, a ridiculous, implausible tale replete with cliches and stereotypes.  Please retire this entire cast and bring Ben back!  
 It's sort of sad that a book being advertised as being  "Completely Revised" is completely the same. Even the date on the CD is 2003! I have the version for Illustrator CS and nothing has been changed between the two volumns, NOTHING! So save yourself some money and buy the version for Illustrator CS if it available. I'm so mad that I purchased this book I could scream. But instead I'm just going to rate the book with a big, fat one star. Maybe the author will get a clue for her next version 
 An author is supposed to communicate with the reading audience.  This book greatly misses the mark, unless of course you are a top intellectual professor.  And even then you might have difficulty.  The author's sentence structure is needlessly complex, and his vocabulary is filled with obscure words, rarely used in normal communication.  The words are not there for any purpose other than to impress the reader with the author's intellect.  I had to reread passages of the book numerous times in an attempt to comprehend what he was saying.  I have two college graduate degrees, so I  am no dummy.  This book made my head hurt and I eventually stopped reading it 
 I found this book to be hard to read.  Take the chapter headings: who is the toddler, the challenges of being a toddler, the question of temperament...  Can you tell exactly are these about?  I can't.  Compare this with Your Two Year Old by Gesell Institute - chapters are: general characteristics of the age, the child with other children, techniques, accomplishments and abilities... The chapter headings indicate to me a much clearer organization.  If I want to know what is an age appropriate skill, I go to the accomplishments section, if I want to know how to manage a behavioral concern, I go to techniques.  The Lieberman book also uses bold face to describe some allegedly actual scenes, and it describes several in a row in unnecessary detail without directly commenting on any of them.  When it does offer advice, it is often in the form of oblique truisms, instead of simple suggestions.  It just seems like a waste of words. You can infer from the truisms what she thinks is a good way to handle certain situations, but she doesn't make it easy to find.  The Gesell book is more likely to give very concise explanations of possible behaviors, reasons for the behaviors, and good ways to manage them.    I found the Gesell book much more interesting reading because it is clearly written, and also much more useful as a reference because it is well organized. 
 Don't even mind getting this... You'll regret as much as I am. I'd give it zero stars if I could 
 Way too expensive for a low quality product.  The clarity of the picture is poor.  There is not enough content to justify the price.  I don't recommend it at all.  I feel I've been cheated 
 As a long time mathematics tutor and teacher I know this book very well. I don't think the material is presented or explained in a way that is especially helpful for young people. As a tutor I have to constantly reintroduce the topic and/or try to stay ahead of the student's class. Beyond that, the students are asked to do only the simplest of proofs. Additionally, a new topic will be introduced and then no problems appear in the exercise portion of the section to help the student test and practice his or her understanding of the newly introduced topic (and of course, those problems invariably will show up on the chapter exam and the final).   Moreover, I think the book just fails the kids. It seems to omit certain standard concepts by being "accessible" and undemanding of even the most minor critical thinking skills. I believe that both of these shortcomings will leave the student unprepared for the challenging problems on standardized tests and on college entrance exams. Not to mention any sort of subsequent advanced work in high school and college.  Another thing about the Larson book is that the answers to many of the problems are so arithmetically peculiar that the student has no feeling that maybe they actually got the right answer. Good problems reassure the student that they are on the right track. Also, once a new concept or definition is introduced it is never repeated.  Overall, I think that the more capable students will be shortchanged and misled into thinking that they know more than they actually do and the less capable student might pass geometry but will perform poorly on college entrance exams and be unable to successfully progress in mathematics if they need to do so.  
 This book is an excellent example of Politically Correct elitist nonsense. From the PC arrogance such as not just displaying the Enola Gay because the "public did not have an adequate understanding with which to view it" to the ludicrous "connection" of American "homophobia" due the word "Gay" in Enola Gay (!!) to the tie-in with "Rambo" movies and our Vietnam experinces, this book trots out every morally bankrupt Leftist cliche that ever existed, and then some. However, it is an EXCELLENT book as typical of the arrogant PC/leftist mind set and ability to ignore reality 
 Im going to rate this product a 2 because I like it but I would change a few things if I could.  It does show you a lot of chords and how to play properly and all that good stuff.  The couple of things I would change is the fact that when they are teaching you a chord, you can play along with the program but its only about 15 seconds, then  you have to stop and click play again.  I wish there was an option where  you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again.  The other thing is something a little more important.  The product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play, its called OLGA.  Well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore.  So you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the Beetles or Metalica or The Grateful Dead or anyone else, and thats what they advertise "Play hit songs". So overall, knowing all this I would have shopped around more.  Especially for the price, its defenitly not worth 40-50 dollars when all you get is little 15 second examples on jingle bells and little traditional folk songs.  
 The same routine as his HBO special Pimp Chronicles.  Pimp Chronicles has better sound, light, and production.  The jokes in this video was the first time.  The HBO special is the EXACT same jokes but polish and delivered better 
 Of the thousands of books I've read in my life, and the hundreds I've actually purchased from Amazon.com, this is the first time I've felt strongly enough about a book to write any sort of review.  I kept waiting for the author to get to the point.  He rambled and meandered and didn't tell me anything new whatsoever.  He used the words "alchemy" and "alchemists" in almost every single paragraph of the book.  Skip this book - you'll get MUCH more out of the "Cosmic Trigger" series, "Quantum Psychology", or "Prometheus Rising" by R.A. Wilson.  
 You have to understand: I am not an Adam Sandler fan. I didn't like him on Saturday Night Live. I don't like his stand-up comedy. I didn't like Happy Gilmore. I didn't like Waterboy. I didn't like Mr. Deeds. (Though... I did like the Wedding Singer, but I take that as the exception that proves the rule...) It was to be expected, going in, that I wouldn't like Billy Madison. And, I didn't.  But maybe you *are* an Adam Sandler fan, like the friend of mine who convinced me to take this chance on Sandler. If so, you'll probabaly really like this movie (it's his favorite of the Sandler films). I'd say that, if you're a Sandler fan, you can add two stars to my review for a total of four.  Sandler is really himself in this film, doing his schtick. For instance, early on he sings a pointless, off-key ode to sunscreen. Sandler fans find that kind of thing funny; I don't. I think that's the barometer for this movie--ask yourself: guy singing about sunscreen, just 'cause. Funny? If so, get this movie.  To get into specifics, Billy Madison is about the title character (Sandler), heir to his father's multi-million dollar corporation, who is in danger of losing out on his inheritance because he's uneducated and unmannered and, in general, a big layabout who spends his days sunbathing and drinking (and singing about sunscreen). Billy makes a deal with his dad that the business will go to him if he manages to pass each grade, 1-12, with 2 weeks for each grade. I hope I'm not spoiling too much to say that: Billy wins in the end, gets the girl (a very hot elementary school teacher) and sticks it to the bad guy (an unscrupulous businessman, scheming to "steal" the business away from Billy).  I found the plot unrealistic. What the hell does it mean to "pass" 12th grade in 2 weeks... and more than that, Madison starts out unable to spell the word "rock" (his version: "rok"); do we really believe he could turn that around so quickly? I found Sandler's character inconsistent. One second he's a spastic moron, the next he's a relatively decent, sensitive guy, and there's no real reason to believe they're the same person. I found the humor lame--jokes revolve around ugly homosexuals finding Billy attractive and little kids pissing on themselves.  None of this will matter to the Sandler fan, but those on the fence might take note.  Some positives include two of the supporting cast--Norm McDonald (who needs to work more) and Chris Farley's brief appearance (who is missed). Also, the teacher/love-interest *is* really hot.  Sandler Fans: 4 Stars.  Everyone Else: 2 Stars 
 To begin, I am not a big fan of Cary Grant, EXCEPT in his Hitchcock movies, where he was excellent. And I enjoy him much with Katharine Hepburn in Bringing Up Baby. He was very good in The Eagle and the Hawk with Fredric March. He was tolerable in The Philadelphia Story and Talk of the Town. A friend of mine loaned me this DVD; she just bought it. I had wanted to see what Cary would do in this film, and I wanted to see him in the dress. From the start, the movie was SLOW and BORING, all the jokes were so lame and not at all funny. I also don't go for films where the man and woman yell at each other and dislike each other, and then at some point realize it is really love they feel for each other. Come on! I just can't understand that sort of romance situation. I felt Cary showed that "mean streak" he can show in some of his films, in the romance situation of this story. I rate this one star because it was one of those films you get bored with right from the beginning and it is sort of torture waiting for it to finally end. All the while I kept saying, "Let's move along, let's end this thing, when does he put on the dress?..." but they dragged it out on and on and on and on with boring,corny jokes. And the part we wanted to see, Cary in the dress, was at the VERY end and not very much at that. Overall, this film was a real disappointment and letdown. The only consolation was that I saw it for free; I didn't have to buy it or rent it. Still, I wasted good time that I could have used in a more profitable and enjoyable way. I would even have enjoyed washing a kitchen full of dirty dishes more than watching this movie!  To sum it up, a VERY VERY BORING and DUMB movie, not to waste your time on. 
 Man, oh man, I think this is one of the worst books I've ever read.  If I could give The Thanatos Syndrome negative stars, I would!  Seriously, half way through, I came to Amazon to see how bad other people thought it was.  Boy was I shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive!  I found the book bizarre, unfocused and poorly written.  The volcabulary repeatedly seems misused.  The plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that US funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation.  The physics, engineering, psychology, medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic.  Characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome, only to have them dissipate.  And so on.  The characters don't even seem like real people.  For example, the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles - and only her ankles - flashing below a curtain, and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are.  How could someone know a person that well, but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood?  Or:  one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive - as though he really thinks this will attract them.  C'mon, if the guys a nut (and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking 'duck' to them is nuts!), write him as a nut the whole way through, don't make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book's climax!  The book's title isn't even explained, for crying out loud.  Thanatos means death in Greek, I believe, but I could never understand what the author/editors/audience thought was dying.  I won't read this one again, nor will I look for anything else by Percy Walker.  
 I have used NEC and Samsung laser printers in the past, but the writeups on this Brother printer attracted me.  My experience after just a month of use is awful:  the print quality is mediocre (seeming very gray in comparison with past printers), and the print drum appears to have failed, leaving streaks of print gaps on the page.  
 Maybe these recipes work in Denver?  I now notice the positive review is from Seattle!!!      I have had no success with the baking recipes at 6,500 ft and higher, and havent tried them at lower altitudes.  The other dishes I've tried did not produce inspired cuisine.       My copy is now available at the used bookstore.  
 There are some good principles in the book, but its way to easy to get lost in all of the repetition and blandness. The section on fibonocci retracements was useful and seems to work well for me in practice; however, I didn't get much else from the book 
 Hank III has done nothing but prove what a whiner he is by trashing other artists.  I have not heard one song on here that suggests any artistic ability.  This guy needs to clean up his mouth and worry about himself instead of trashing others 
 The book was filled with many pages of interesting info that I found informative and enjoyable to read as a literature teacher. It was composed with inciteful quotes that can influence the reader.  Finally, I would  advise anyone interested in reading about a great man like this one should  go out and buy this boo 
 It started out great.  Then the step mechanism broke after two months.  Not worth the money 
 Imagine this...a movie starring (or at least co-starring) Keanu Reeves that is more interesting than the book it is based on. That's about all that needs to be said about this book.    The book started out ok but after the shift from Transylvania to England it starts a steady desent. The ending in the book is kind of an after-thought and anti-climactic.  The portrayal of the 'good' characters is dripping with Victorian non-sense. Overall I'm surprised this book is actually listed as a classic.  For a classic suspense/horror story, see 'Jeckel and Hyde', 'Frankenstein', any Poe story or 'Hound of the Baskervilles'.  Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' is not worth the time or money. 
 It's seriously scary that some people will read this one book, and think they have Lincoln down, without ever bothering to read the full breadth of primary texts written by Lincoln himself, or put them in context with the age in which he existed.  Lincoln is not a mythic god, and many white people such as myself are not nearly so naive as some of the reviewers of this book would have you believe.    What is bothersome is the very premise of the book, that Lincoln was "forced into glory," as though he had no free will in the matter.  Lincoln constantly received death threats throughout his presidency, not from abolitionists, but from pro slavery elements.   In fact, it could be powerfully argued that this gave Lincoln an equally great deal of incentive to be "forced into shame" (i.e. into doing nothing about slavery and thus preserving his life, as I have no doubt lesser men would have done).  He knew all too well the dangers involved in doing what he did, but he did it anyway.  And by the way, he was murdered because of it.    Martin Luther King, Jr. is one of the great heros of my life, and in my opinion, the world.  One day, many years from now, I have no doubt he will be reevaluated and his moral being will be judged as having a deep and unforgivable fault, that being the many infidelities of his married life.   Although any true account of King's life would indeed be incomplete without it (just as any account of Lincoln's life would be incomplete without it's less savory aspects), it should not be allowed to overshadow the tremendous good that he brought about.  The same is the case with Lincoln.  Parts of Mr. Bennett's book are sound, but unfortunately even those parts come across as suspect when his one-sided picking and choosing of facts in other parts of the book is taken into account.  It's just sloppy and irresponsible scholarship.  People's lives and motivations aren't so cut and dry as you would like to believe, Mr. Bennett.  I hope readers of this book will not be so naive 
 First off the company I work for ordered three of these.  One out of the three did not work.  There is no sound comming from the right side and it isn't the speaker as we have tried different speakers.  Amazon will not take it back and will not exchange it for another one.  This is just the start.  The two that do work work very poorly.  The connecotor for the iPod is very flimsey and feels like it will break off.  They give you inserts to use depending on what model iPod you have.  These inserts prevent the iPod from sliding all the way down so when you use them the iPod will not work.  Also, the CD player has a lid that opens with a motor.  Yes, a motor.  So, if you push it down when it is open it will close but this throws off the gears as it is very sensitive and now the damn things don't close all the way.  You need to use the open/close button to prevent this but natural reaction is to push the lid down when it is open.  All of the buttons are very clumbsy and confusing.  The sound is not that great at all!  There are a TON of wires with this thing.  Power, speaker, antenna and iPod firewire type connector all run between the speakers, subwoofer and main unit. This is not a good product and has been a nightmare for my department. 
 After one month I have never received the item. Never even received a shipping confirmation. So am extremely dissappointed in the seller you adevertise. The other DVD came just fine I ordered from another seller. So sorry can't honestly rate the item when it was never sent. I've been very patient waiting for it to come and extremely busy so haven't had a chance to write before  Mark Cai 
 The book mentions all the things you can do, but most of the time not how to do it 
 I picked up this book since it was in the 25 best american novels ever written according to the New-York Times.  Initially, I was interested since the story unfolds in Africa and I knew little about that continent, however, Norman Rush's prose feels really heavy, and, in the end, it wears you out.  I don't recommend this book, instead, pick up A fine balance by Rohinton Mistry. Much better story unfolding in another country 
 I agree complete with Erik Cobbett. This is Covenant's most unnecessary and boring album ever. There are a couple of nice parts on it, but generally it's a big disappointment. 
 Unless you are burning to know more about Mr Rabinow.  The book reads more like a justification for Rabinow's ethnographic failure than like reflections upon his experiences.  Much better examinations of the  fieldwork experience are available.  Nevertheless, Rabinow does have an  interesting style and sense of drama which makes for a not unpleasant  reading experience.  Were the title not so misleading I would like the book  better but it should really be known as "Reflections on my Failure as  an Ethnographer in Morocco.&quot

 how in the World that Dave Chappelle blew up in the first place is a real mystery?? so now that he choked a 50 Million Dollar pay day away he got smart&knows He doesn't deserve half the attention he has gotten in the first place. this is a Insult to Wattstaxx. that documentary from 1973 was important this is just a mess.  the music Acts on here are lame as well. you want the Big Acts  of today not no Milk carton, Has-beens or non-hit having acts.  the only thing funny about this film is that it got made&was released. glad his corny show is no more. good riddence. this movie is equally bad as well. 
   First, I know this review looks too long, but it might help you out. So please, read on.  I read a few of the "chapters" (exercise sections) of this book and found it to be a little too conversational. Sure, we all value a charming and witty instruction book to a dry academic one, but I still think she brings nothing new to this genre of book.    It seems like she could easily have gotten all of these ideas from other writing books, seminars and articles, and frankly, most of them are better written than this one. You've probably encountered most of the ideas put forth in this book, beginning with an intro akin to:    "Oh, we all say we're going to write, but we never get around to it. Well never, fear, because [insert generic writing guide book title] is here to kick your rear in gear!"    Something like that.     There are really so many different types of books, kits, articles, memoirs, classes and manifestos on the subject of writing, exercises, inspiration and so forth. (Just do a search on Amazon for Writing Instruction or Writing for Publication.)  I really can't recommend this book, though.      Unfortunately, the author also thinks it's cute or somehow necessary to write quite a few words in ALLCAPS to add emphatic notice to the concept. Personally, I think that WRITING like THIS every few PAGES looks unprofessional and can be quite IRRITATING. This stylistic flaw alone makes me wonder whether she's a very credible source. Is font manipulation creative? Sure, to an extent, but "all-caps" serves no purpose, and it's easy to do and banal.     I think that this work misses a point about writing: it requires self-discipline as well as inspiration and talent. It's easy and sometimes fun to get caught up in books like these, but really, if you just read a varity of nonfiction, novels and periodicals for a few hours each week you can begin to understand observational skills, and you won't need these silly little exercises.  You'll be inspired by what you read, and how the articles or whatever you read remind you of your own experiences.    So, the point is, if you feel that you need to spend money on a book like this, perhaps you don't have the ability to discipline yourself into a steady routine of journaling and writing. Buying a book like this one will allow you to read some tips and eventually forget about it. After brief excitement and productivity, you'll be back to square one; with no self-discipline, you'll never apply this book to your life week-by-week as you should. It will collect dust next to your yoga books.  I offer this criticism not to sound nasty, but to make you think about what you are buying.   It's simple to buy a Men's Fitness magazine, for instance, but it won't help you unless you actually work out routinely. Same thing.   I guess the bottom line is that this book is okay for a casual read, but look it over in a bookstore first to see if you really want to pay the price of owning it.   I give it about 2.4 stars. 
 For me, this book was too general to be of any help. The best I've read so far is FROM REEL TO DEAL 
 I read this book, aafter I had seen the movie several times and I must say, Elizabeth Levy left out alot of the Romance and other things. But she did put a different view on things. I would give it 2 1/2 stars, but I  can't 
 I seem to have only gotten the cliff notes on my dvd and not the story.  Innocent Eugenie is take to an island by a rich couple who do business with her father.  He knows they are interested in exploiting her for sexual purposes but they promise nothing too strong.  Well, they constantly drug Eugenie through her drinks and the wife starts the "journey into perversion" by having them bath and wash together.  There are a few steps but very few indeed and soon Eugenie is happily involved in Satanic rituals and removing body parts from participants.  What kind of story is this?  Eugenie doesn't take much to be corrupted.  We don't see much conflict or the psychology of any transformation.   It all just happens.  I don't see any convincing story of a seduction into this huge personality change at all.  I really don't know what people see in this film and how it gets such great reviews.  I guess when the "erotic" scenes are red and blurred, this causes people to feel it is sophisticated camera work and film style and are impressed by it.  Instead of being a journey into perversion, innocent Eugenie jumps right into Satanic rituals with no explanation.  I don't see anything compelling about this at all 
 Purchased this book because the Table of Contents under Browse Sample Pages showed the full content of the book.  However, the Harriman House Classics hardcover edition only has three of the chapters. 
 I have loved many of Jodi Picoult's other books, but this one seemed too far-fetched. I did not feel the evil depicted in the comic book drawings was necesary to the storyline and in-fact detracted from it.  Many of my friends who are Jodi fans were also disappointed in this newest release 
 I love Deep Banana Blackout. Their album "Feel The Peel" is easily one of my all-time favorites. I purchased realse the grease expecting the same kind of energetic funk with complex horn lines and funky vocals.  While the album has its good moments, the vocals are ocasionally off pitch and the songs lack the complexities and soul of previous albums. and the final big bottom cover is just stupid.  maybe they broke up for the better. Sorry guys, but you shoulda stuck to the peel 
 Have to agree with the reviewer from Melbourne on this one. Herzog says in the introduction that he eschews any overarching methodology, laudable in theory I suppose but not very good in practice. The result is a rather  meandering narrative that lacks the benefit of a clear central argument to  structure it. Probably the main strength of the book is that it draws on a  staggeringly broad set of texts. [To be fair, I have not read the entire  book, so you can take my criticisms with a grain of salt I suppose, though  I do think I have grasped the essentials of his text. 
 Save your money - look for wisdom elsewhere.  This book was a thorough disappointment.  But wait there's more...no there isn't 
 I would love to review this Lions Gate DVD, but I can't catch one word in ten.  It is NOT, as advertised, closed-captioned, and the characters' speech is too casual and British for me to get.  Drat! -- I was so chuffed to see there was a cc version 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 I thought that this album wasnt one of Keith's best albums...I like some of the older albums better but maybe we will see more of the "better" albums in the future 
 The pedometer worked great for the first two weeks. Than my 1 1/2 year old snatched it off my jeans, it fell on the tile floor and broke the casing of it. It still worked, but I had to be careful when I opened it because the back was broken and no longer attached. Last w/e it stopped working completely. Everthing is set to 0 and won't move. My husbands odometer seems to be working fine. However, I'm dissapointed for the short life-span....  M. L. McDermot 
 I was a little disappointed to see the clothes from the dress up trunk.  When my daughter took them out on Christmas day and started trying them on, we all broke out in laughter.  The shirts that they included in the trunk came up to her upper chest area.  I'm not sure who they made these shirts to fit, but they don't fit my very skinny 4 yr old or my 3 yr old son who is shorter in stature then my 4 yr old.  Some of the clothes are cute but I would save your money and buy something else 
 I could not put this one down- I finished it in one evening, I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next, with the family and the court case. However, I was deeply disappointed by the ending. It was lame, it was soap opera-esque, it was so unworthy of this great story. Tacked-on and totally unneeded- it should have ended ten pages sooner, that would have be a fine conclusion 
 puddle of mud the nirvana of 2000 god these guys try to be tough hiding behind distorted and swearing and wearing their caps backwards OWWWW big men i can't cope with it killing me i think i'm gonna wet my pants at how lame this band sounds after their hit single "she hates me" has drifted away..and it's replaced with more media twoodle which will get the clones with their hoodies and chains in their pockets and baggy trousers going crazy and wetting their pants NOT COOL NOT ROCK AND ROLL AT ALL  are puddle of mudd really trying to re-vive grunge that they have to rip off all the riffs of the great bands i.e pixies, screaming trees etc  another band that nicks stuff just like oasis  hell i had to wind up the oasis fans aswell  i hate puddle of puke  avoided buy anything by the pixies, screaming trees the cult before this  only if your a ten year old hoodie year clone then you will think it's the greatest album ever made  well i'm a 19 year old and i think it sucks!!!!!!!!! 
 This book was a required text, otherwise I never would have read it.  The book is full of inconstancies, bad literary technique, and it takes to many pages to cover not enough material.  The authors personal prejudices are obvious.  There are better books on teamwork available 
 I bought this slim 53 page volume hoping to get a little background on Voltaire's life, work, and philosophy. But for a book so obviously intended as an introduction to Voltaire, Gray's book instead is a scathing criticism, using basic introductory level information on Voltaire and the Enlightenment era as examples to make his argument. His conclusion- that "Voltaire's 'philosophy' has little to teach us," and that his work was heavily flawed and derivative in its time, and too "difficult" and "irrelevant for the modern reader." If this is true, then why was the book commisionned, and why am I reading it? The book is neither a suitable introduction to Voltaire, or a scholarly work of any noticeable merit, since the author never goes even remotely in depth enough to explain his positions. I can't believe this was written by a college professor. What was he on? For a better introduction to Voltaire, read his novella Candide, an excellent and hilarious little novel that raises questions that perhaps Gray would prefer to avoid 
 Just finished Emily Griffin's Something Borrowed then picked this one up right after...What a difference! Love at First Site is extremely boring right off the bat and the writing style is so painfully unnatural I couldn't make it past the first 40 pages. Griffin's debut, by comparison, is one of the best chick lit novels out there--very engaging with strong characters and lots of romantic suspense. Even if you like British chick lit authors as I do, don't bother with this one by Jane Moore 
 SMALL MEMORY WHICH MEANS THAT U CAN ONLY PUT 1 SAVE ON IT SO U HAVE TO RUN BACK TO YOUR COMP EVERYTIME U WANNA SAVE!!! AND SOFTWARE IS VEERY CONFUSING!!! HORRIBLE BUY!!! I RETURNED THE PIECE OF JUNK!! 
 I was surprised to realize that this book wasn't a comedy. I was laughing happily at the ridiculous prose (crafted to imitate Poe's writing style) and the clever, over-the-top parodies of both Crockett's and Poe's characters. But as I read on, I realized that the novel possibly wasn't intended to be funny. Did I misunderstand? I came to Amazon.Com to find out. Well. Here I found it. It's supposed to be a deadly serious book. None of the reviewers, neither professional nor readers like myself, describe the book as a parody. (Or even acknowledge the parody.) As I read on, I found myself less and less willing to put up with the author's style. Unable to trust it as humor, it's simply a tedious book. I didn't finish it 
 It's not funny, unless you're a moron. It's not suspenseful. The "mystery" is predictable to anyone who has seen more than one television suspense show. The characters are hollow. The interaction is tedious. And despite some hopeful signs of drug use, there are no hallucinations or grand insights. In fact, this book is entropy, resurfaced, and should be recycled immediately so we can print something more stimulating on the pulp, like perhaps instruction manuals for screwdrivers 
 tells you nothing you don't already know and really didn't offer much advise 
 Incoherent.  This book wanders seemingly at random.  Travelog?  Literary criticism?  Science?  History of?  Behavior studies?  I might well want to read any one of these, at various times.  What I am not interested in, is a book that wanders from one to the other.  Poorly reasoned.  The author steps from the observed facts of commonalities at the genome level, to the fairly safe conclusion that all earthly life has common ancestry, but then leaps to the absolutely unjustified conclusion that "life [on earth] happened once and only once".  Nonsense: the evidence does not rise to that level.  For one thing, life could just as easily have started 1000 times and been extinguished by inferno in the early bombardment period.  And, it should be well known to the author that there was no single tree of descent for unicellular life - they routinely exchange genetic material and have even combined to form more complex cells.  Pardon me, but there is plenty of room in that history for multiple geneses to have been obscured by early exchanges and combinations.  So, the author can't write straight and can't think straight - regretfully, I find that I for one have no use for this work.  
  The characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting. An effort to watch. Make-up, dyed hair, costumes poorly done. One man's eyebrows, the suitor's, are altered like a woman's! No scenery or homes of interest, except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor. Not a pleasant pace, without humor, without intrigue. A lesbian undertone in one scene.   The only positive thing I can think of is this good line of Jane Austen, quoted. Fanny sums up in one sentence, why she will not marry him. Women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty, will wish to sum up their certainty with Ms. Austen's line: "His sole interest is in being loved, not in loving". This line is an exception to a lifeless script.  There, now you do not need to endure the painful movie. Here are two lines re-written by me: For the woman dealing with a trifling man: "No man suffers pains of love on the stage." For dealing with the infatuated man: "You have wounded yourself, but not with love."   This movie should be re-made by someone sharing the ideals of Jane Austen. There is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film, humorous, with singing, with interest. A movie can take the best of the book, in the spirit of the book, which this movie did not carry, and make a movie better than the book. This movie is bad any which way.   Well-made period romance films are: "Pride & Prejudice 2005, 1996, & 1940", "Wives & Daughters", "North & South". Fairly made is "Under the Greenwood Tree". I rated "Persuasion" at 2-stars for the wooden acting; however "Persuasion" is 5-stars compared to this "Mansfield Park". "Persuasion" has attractive scenery, costumes, beautiful singing, and an uplifting plot; though of interest only to women, preferably who have already read the book.  
 I must admit I was skeptical about this book upon seeing Buzz Aldrin on the cover instead of the books subject Neil Armstrong.  I tried to give the author the benefit but upon reading the book it was just filled with too many factual errors to be considered an accurate account of Armstrong.  Admittedly I am an aircraft and space enthusiast and someone who didn't know about the subject would not catch the most of the errors in this book, however, the erroneous information discounts the validity of the book in my opinion.   It's a shame because what an intriguing character Neil Armstrong is 
 Such beautiful pictures, and they are great inspiration. Makes you want to spend the day in the kitchen.  There it ends. I tried the white chocolate-candy cane recipe twice.  It just doesn't work.  We (I have a professional kitchen) added flour to make a manageable batter, but after baking could not get them off the baking sheet.  More adjustments, and finally succeeded in making a cookie that no one liked.  We also tried the two layer desert with brownie bottom.  Expensive mess.  The  beautiful photographs are worthy of framing or put the whole book on your coffee table. 
 This is a typical book based on the European sense of superiority over other cultures. It claims that very heart of Indian religion and philosophy, which is based on the Upanishads, is merely a way to impress  Westerners. However, given the acknowledged fact that these scriptures  predate most of Western civilization by thousands of years, how could they  have been motivated by the need to impress Europeans at that time. In  relatively recent times, Shankara re-popularized the Upanishad philosophy,  giving it the name Vedanta. But that too was in the 7th century, a thousand  years before the arrival of the British in India. It was in reaction to the  Buddhists, particularly the Madhyamikya, that Vednata was polularized  starting in the 7th century. One should read the many Westerners who have  been and continue to be inspired by the Upanishads for many of the ideas  that constitute today's prevalent worldview in the West called  post-modernism. I suggest that its better for a reader to read books by  authors such as Harold Coward, Fritojf Schoun, W. C. Smith, Hustom Smith,  and Bede Griffiths, in order to get a baeetr view 
 I buy a lot of books from amazon, and I rarely make any comments. The material and style of this book are outdated, and it is vague on content. The authors should make a revised version, or the book should no longer be printed.  Bottom line, do not buy it! I am returning my copy. 
 I hate to be a party pooper, but as much as one hopes to love this book, it was just too poorly written and edited.  It has many terrific ideas for someone who has baked pies before, but for a newcomer like myself, the defects are pretty glaring.  I bought the book because I love "The Cake Bible".  But this time, the editor went to press before finishing her work, and I bet she's responsible for wasting many thousands of hours of her readers' time, considering how popular this book is.  In order to make crust using this book, you have to flip back and forth between many sections: the dough recipe, the rolling instructions, the laying out of the dough, and the baking are all in different places, in the wrong order, and not clearly labeled. I can see why this happened, because the rolling and baking are similar for different dough recipes, and she didn't want to repeat the same instructions over and over.  But at least the sections should have been in order!  Additional stories and comments are intermixed with the instructions, which makes it hard to follow the instructions once you find them.  Different dimensions are given in different places for the size of the rolled dough you need.  Sections headings are not consistently formatted--sometimes a new subsection is in the same style as the heading that started the section.  I'm a professional scientist and university professor, and I love to cook.  I don't think I have any special impairment following instructions.  The other reviewers who liked this book surely had the same experience, unless they knew ahead of time what they were doing, so I say to them: stop recommending this book so highly, except to experienced pie and tart bakers!  For making pastry the first time, I would use "The Way to Cook" by Julia Child instead, which manages to give all of the necessary instructions very clearly, in the correct order, in about two pages.  Then buy Beranbaum's book and read it at leisure if you want inspiration and expert knowledge, and you don't mind an error here or there.  I hope there will be an easier-to-use second edition of this book.  The tart I made was truly delicious, but the process made me angry.  I'm guessing that the author or editor or publisher decided their deadline was more important than a final week of editing.  What a shame 
 Title says it all.  I enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series.  Forth book sort of dragged.  By the middle of this book I had to make a decision...keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel.  Let's face it, life's too short.  If you want a thousand pages of satisfaction pick up the unabridged version of "The Stand".  I'm afraid this doesn't do it.    Think about it another way do you want to read over 5000 pages of a series that has mixed reviews from like minded fantasy readers?  Cheer 
 I ordered my subscription 3 months ago and still have not received it.  
 Have you ever seriously regretted spending money on a book that you thought was terrible? If so, congratulations! You know how I feel. This book was lame, lame, lame. It was sooooo boring! I was actually about halfway through this book when I got bored with it and stopped reading it. It was probably three months later when I picked it back up again to finish it. Then I kinda wished I hadn't. This was like reading an attempt by your 14-year-old friend to write a novel. Man, I could have written this book! I felt like I had heard this same story like fifteen times before. I gave this book 2 stars because some of it was kinda cute, but it was so unoriginal. I have a feeling that the same problem is going to overtake teen fiction for girls in the future 
 As an English Lit. major in college a MLA Handbook is indispensible, but I was disappointed with this one.  I found it difficult to locate the information I needed, often having to comb several pages to find what I was looking for.  It is just not convenient to use.  I much prefer Diana Hacker's "A Writer's Reference."  The layout of her book is much simpler to navigate, and the spiral binding is always a plus, because it lays open on your desk nicely.   
 Discursive and digressive, David Thomson's `The Whole Equation' is less a history of Hollywood than a meditation on the business of making pictures.  The book's title comes from a line in F. Scott Fitzgerald's `The Last Tycoon' and refers, I believe, to the multi-faceted quality of picture making.  Motion pictures are products, widgets produced by a place called Hollywood; they are also art, as well as a mirror to our culture, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.    I wanted to like this book.  Thomson seems to be a well-respected film critic and I'm not averse to jumping on a passing bandwagon, but I also wanted to learn a little of the history of Hollywood.  You know, facts piled upon facts?  Thomson is more inclined to impression and analyses, some of it a bit off the board.  The chapter "Divorce, America Style" examines the connection between the rise of the divorce rate in America with what was happening in motion pictures.  It isn't the first, or the last, time Thomson strays to pursue such things.     If you have the patience for it there are some amusing moments, but if you're like me, looking for a just-the-facts history of Hollywood `The Whole Equation' isn't it.  
 Perhaps Puffy only got as far as he could riding on Biggie's legacy, but lets face it, he really has very little talent, charisma, charm and just seems so dull, he is basically a male Paris Hilton, going around acting like the world's biggest d1ck ny saying "look people, I got money, arent I cool" besides Biggie(RIP), Bad Boy really is not great, most of the artists are poor quality, The production is awful and no one has not even shown potetial. This album is basically not even worth printing or existing. It is just sad that many great underground rappers are not getting any attention while garbage like Diddy plague are airwaves and puts his dumb face everywhere on TV. I don't know why people like Tupac, Biggie, Dimebag, Chuck Shuldiner and countless other greats are buried but this guy still breaths. So I would say in conclusion that we should do what people like chingy and D4L deserve, a 1 star rating.     
 Oh man did I get burned buying this DVD! it sucks so much! How can they even release this movie??!! Did they know it is Street Fighter not Street Talker???  This movie is all BS!! 
 Whether or not you like this collection of essays will depend on your definition of travel writing. D.Cooper's "Canadian Gothic", J.McPhee's "A Fleet of One" and B.Donahue's "Under the Sheltering Sky" are all excellent. However many of the pieces chosen are little more than self-indulgent fluff. Was 2004 such a mediocre year for travel writing? M.Byers "Monuments to Our Better Nature" and R.Chevat's incoherent "Screenwriters Vacation" and M.Gorra's "Innocents Abroad?" are hardly memorable.  As another review has pointed out the selections seem to come from a rather limited field: The New Yorker, National Geographic, Travel&Leisure. There are thousands of publication venues, yet Pico Iyer decided to treat us  to an anthology that is  top heavy with selections from the  main stream "Big Media" press. The publisher of this series, Houghton-Mifflin hasn't strayed far from the ground that it feels most comfortable with-established main stream authors. Even the piece by Tim Cahill does not represent his best writing. Most of the selections in this book seem like warmed-up left-overs.  As another reviewer has  mentioned,  only 4 of the 24 selected authors are women writers. This just boggles the mind... were there no women writers of merit in 2004?  My main concern is that few of these selections are really "travel stories". Some are set in foreign locales, but deal with subjects like teaching English in Tanzania, riding the bus in NYC,  famine in Ethiopia ,and  political repression in Burma. There is also an irritating post-9/11 angst in several of the essays. While this maybe a  reflection of the mood of  American writers in 2004  coming to grips with their new found feeling of insecurity in their comfortable middle-class lives, it does not reflect the daily  pre-occupations of the other 5 billion souls on the planet. There is a self-centered navel gazing in this collection of essays that reflects some of the worst, not the  best of recent travel writing.  Nowhere in this collection will you find the brilliant writing of  W. Thesinger, Freya Stark, Norman Lewis, Eric Hansen,  or Jan Morris. You will find a lot of boring and recondite references to Henry James  however.  This collection of essays is to travel writing what Starbucks is to a bistro . If you can't tell the difference from the real thing, you might enjoy it. Maybe.   I would give this book a big miss, and send a message to Houghton-Mifflin . Donald Rumsfeld famously referred to the "old Europe". This collection of essays isn't even "old-style travel writing". It is a mis-directed bore, brought to you from the same corporate folks that convinced you that chicken McNuggets is  really food. This isn't travel literature. It isn't even literature. Most of the collection is dross. 
   THE TRANSFORMERS gets my vote as the worst movie of the 1980's.  It pains me to say this for I am a fan of the series.  It was a travesty to see Optimus Prime (the greatest of the Transformers) fall in battle and pass on the Matrix of Leadership to a successor (Rodimus Prime) who proved incapable of leadership.  Galvatron was a pathetic reincarnation of Megatron--he lacked the malevolent cunning of Megatron and behaved like a raving lunatic.  Why would a Decepticon warrior follow him into battle?  As for the new generations of Autobots and Decepticons introduced in the movie, they were forgettable.   It amuses me that "fans" are raving about the movie now yet they did not pay to see the movie when it was released twenty years ago.  THE TRANSFORMERS failed at the box office and I am glad it did.  As a fan, I was insulted.  Perhaps these other "fans" have allowed nostalgia to blind them to the ugly truth of this outrage.   
 Read other books and find that this is for people in the maybe 70's! It is not interesting for my 2004 life. Don't be fooled by the horror stories and read other books that depict the good points and bad points but not just the bad 
 I read this and am reminded of 1984. The tortured arrival at a non offensive language, suggestions for such to writers, is repulsive.  This is intellectual vandalism. Works of literature are not vehicles for consciousness raising unless that is the subject.  Something about this makes me wonder if the writer has gotten on a narrow path, obsessive in nature, and cannot simply do her job 
 Reads more like a blog-rant than a book.  The author bends facts to meet her view of reality.  Her agenda is clear from the start.  If she understood the references she quotes it would be a better book.  
 This book has very little to teach you and it's virtually unreadable. Make sure you read one or two pages before you buy in case you are like me and you can't stand his style 
 . .If you could sue writers for false advertising regarding what they write on bookjackets, you'd have a great case against these two! This book rehashes old legends and stories but provides nothing new. In fact, it does not even provide a good synopsis of what allegedly occurred during the "experiment", providing only bits and pieces along the way. It actually sounds like an addendum to some previous work that assumes you have heard all the cool details, and provides you with a few coincidences that the authors assume support their case. A don't know much about William L. Moore, but I used to read all Charles Berlitz's books when I was a kid, as I thought the Bermuda Triangle made for some great stories. But as I got older, I realized that that's all they were. Charles Berlitz never made any groundbreaking discoveries while "researching" his Bermuda Triangle books, just rehashed old sailor's tales. I recall him during a guest spot on the "Larry King Live" program, and when I Coast Guard officer called in and provided known, verifiable details on some of his "without a trace" cases, Berlitz looked like a monkey. As a former Coast Guard Rescue Pilot myself, stationed for 3 years in Borinquen, Puerto Rico (one of the apexes of the "Triangle"), I can also assure you that it is quite easy for an aircraft or moderately sized vessel to "disappear without a trace", and that there is nothing mysterious about it. . .it's a big ocean! I witnessed the indistinct horizons and other phenomena, all of which had perfectly good explanations. Save yourself some money and avoid all books that have Charles Berlitz's name associated with them unless you're reading them for "entertainment purposes only" 
 ...the student confessed that he had made it up after being confronted by the professor who had repeated the story to a Standard-Times reporter.  The professor, Brian Glyn Williams, said he went to his former student's house and asked about inconsistencies in his story. The 22-year-old student admitted it was a hoax, Williams said.

 As the reviewer from Jackhorn, KY stated, this book lacks original research.  If you read the section on the "house church movement" and then go to the website for The Homechurch Homepage, you will see that Mr. Wolfe hacked away at many of the articles on the site to obtain his "research."  For the many quotes he used from the website, not once were any of the authors contacted by Mr. Wolfe in order to do any original research.  If he had done so, he would have come away with a different take than he wrote in his book 
 With 2 cds of endless repeated chords, they don't have much to say 
 This book was good for me spiritually: it bored the hell out of me 
 Chambers seems to cover the required material for Mac OS 10.3 OK, but he could have said it in less than half of the 692 pages if he kept his all-to-frequent attempts to be entertaining out of the book.   Example: ". . . drag the default bar at the bottom of the window to the toolbar at the top. This is the toolbar equivalent of tapping your ruby slippers together three times and repeating, 'There's no place like home.'" (p.-175). He carries on like this to the point of distraction.   I would recommend two other books: Easy Mac OS X, v10.3 Panther ©2004 (288 pages) by Kate Binder - much more clear than Chambers, and has lots of screen shots to show how to set up and use OS X. The second book, Mac OS X Panther Unleashed ©2004 (1673 pages) by John & William C. Ray - delves into technical details, but also covers all the information non-technical users need 
 Disclaimer:  I only read selections from this book!  I was interested in looking through this book because 1.) people have told me it is good and 2.) I thought Blue like Jazz was terrible and cannot understand why people like his writting so much.   With that in mind I purused a copy of my friends and not surprisingly found it just as underwhelming.    The writing is getting better.  The "insights" into life, while highly personal and occationally compelling, are shallow and obvious.  It is like being at a Sunday sermon where the pastor preaches a moving speach, but upon reflection you realize it was just another homily.  Spend the time you would be reading this book doing something much more constructive - like reading and reflecting on the bible itself 
 I wish that I had more carefully considered all these other opinions that suggest this book is not that good...because now I agree. On my best day I am barely an intermediate web designer and this book had not ONE secret to offer me. The Studio Secrets book it is for beginners only - the HTML is the same as any other beginner book, and the scripting samples you can pull off of virtually any web page 
 The book is fine, except I had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer.  She's such a boring character.  She's young, but not motivated to work.  In fact, she quited one of her jobs when Macon covered her rent.  The dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men, and get support.  The point is that she doesn't enjoy the job, thus, a detailed description of her dog training job (which she doesn't seem to enjoy) was just a boring digression 
 Shrewish. Prude. Judgemental. Blathery. Catty. Disjointed.   What a shame. There's a lot to be said about female sexuality and feminism in general, but Levy doesn't bother with the core of any it. Instead, she spends her time interviewing the flightiest Spring Breakers she can find, criticizing successful women for acting manish, and obsessing about fringe cultural fads.  I was disappointed to see so many prejudices in Levy. She is one of the worst FCPs I've read. And a stick in the mud, to boot 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 This movie was just about the worst movie I ever saw... so utterly and painfully pointless, and not the slightest bit funny. Tom Green makes a complete fool of himeself. I actually turned off the movie half-way through because it was so stupid... Don't waste your time or money on this one! 
 This novel comes off like a high schooler wanting to write about the movie and music industries.  In between the entertainment biz cliches, the author can only think to put various assination hits.  some of the characters are interesting but not believable, and they  certainly can't make up for the braindead plot.  Read some of his other novels and skip this one 
 Made and first released (as Tell Your Children) in 1936, when Prohibition still protected innocent youth from the purgatory of alcohol abuse, Reefer Madness began life as a morality tale to protect innocent youth from marijuana. Tell Your Children was a low-budget production, made by G&H Productions for a small church group.  The director had gained almost all of his experience in silent film. So, the facial expressions and gestures of the actors are exaggerated as they were in silent films. This "problem" became an asset later.  The movie begins with a Star Wars like scroll that touts marijuana as The Real Public Enemy Number One! The film hammers on marijuana so hard that at one point a doctor is relieved to find that his patient has only had heroin and not marijuana. Clearly, story, written by Laurence Meade, and the screenplay, written by Arthur Hoerl, could have used some validation by a real doctor with real drug treatment experience.  It was Dwaine Esper, a pioneer intellectual property pirate who bought the rights to the film, spliced in some salacious sex scenes and marketed the resulting Reefer Madness as an exploitation film. As a sensation exploitation of the marijuana menace, the film made some money for Esper. Then it fell into nameless disuse and eventually passed into the public domain.  In the early 1970s, Keith Stroup, a founder of The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), paid less than $300 for the film, cleaned it up, and began showing it at rallies. The pomposity and overacting were a big hit with the (frequently stoned) marijuana advocates.  Since then it has achieved cult status. It is up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  All this would make Reefer Madness a genuinely funny viewing experience were it not for crack, and heroin. I felt bad watching this film, not because it was not uproarious camp, but because I live in the center of a fine, historical city where mothers try to sell you their crack babies, and heroin addicts mumble incoherently trying to panhandle in front of the halfway houses where they have been dumped.  If Amazon, or those who reap the profit on the sales of this DVD, would donate to quality rehab programs, I would feel less like taking a shower after watching this 
 In her section about Lakewood, the author tries to create a connection between Lakewood, the spur posse, and the military-industrial complex that does not exist.  She regards Lakewood as a breeder town, built to supply human labor for the aerospace industry.  Here are the facts:  1.  Lakewood was created in 1948 by real estate investors to provide housing for returning WW2 veterans.  2.  The LB Naval Shipyard, Douglas Aircraft, Lockheed, Northrop, and North American Aviation were all in operation long before Lakewood was built.  3.  The spur posse was given way too much publicity by the tabloid TV vultures to a National audience.  I emphasize the word National.  The market for those kind of unhealty tv shows goes beyond southern Calif.  Lakewood home values are very good, and the neighborhood infrasturcture is a lot more organized than most southern Calif housing projects built in the same era.  If she wants to bash a southern Calif. neighborhood, Long Beach would be an easier target.  There, you have many nice one-home lots that were destroyed by investors who built 8-unit apartments on a one-home lot.  Anyone who has not actually lived in Lakewood might believe her essay...but it is not reality.  In the end, she thinks So. Calif is headed over the cliff.  I would say the idyllic "Calif. Golden Fantasy" is no more...but whatever changes that occur here will have to be dealt with in a positive manner, instead of just being given an obituary 
 Useful for traveling and basic translation purposes, but very limited in word meanings. This is particularly true for the English to French section, where a word will often have only one corresponding meaning 
 If you want to read the purple prose of a man who is deeply ashamed of being latino and gay--in fact, so ashamed of the latter that he paints a picture of gays and lesbians as a talentless lot of artificial people doomed by moral pestilence-- then this is the book for you. If you're white and heterosexual and you're looking for a brown-skinned person to make you feel like you're culturally superior, why this book will be downright therapeutic 
 Man oh man...I love documentaries and character studies.  Crumb, Capturing the Friedmans, The Thin Blue Line etc...  But THIS...my god, the mind boggles at the level of pretentiousness of the folks who claim to "love" or "get" this horrible mess.  Over an hour and a half of two crazy women who are essentially shut-ins rambling on about nothing at all in what looks like an abandoned shack surrounded by vermin and garbage a foot deep.  The two women in question are "Big Edie" and "Little Edie", the aunt and cousin of Jackie O respectively.   Let me sum up the whole 100 minutes for you;  Little Edie: I hate it here. I had to leave New York to come here and take care of my mother. Big Edie: I was fine. I used to have a lovely singing voice. Little Edie: But I missed out on my big chance to make it. Big Edie: Oh well. You missed out. Little Edie: I miss New York. I hate it here. Big Edie: Did you feed the cats? Little Edie; YES!!! I fed them!!! Big Edie: I used to have a lovely singing voice.   Now imagine this being repeated over and over again for 100 minutes.   Do yourself a favor; Before you let anyone talk you into seeing this piece of dreck just go sit on skid row for 2 hours and listen to the rambling of the hobos and mental patients.  You'll save the money and get some fresh air at the same time.   Horrible. Just plain horrible 
 I couldn't finish this book. It seemed like fiction to me. After losing my husband and son I was really looking for an intellegent book on the subject of reincarnation. This book was a real disappointment. Many of the author's hypnotic subjects have a suspiciously similar conversational style. Similar, in fact, to the author's own conversational style. While trying to read this book I actually became angry with the author for expecting the public to believe such nonsense. Fairies and Elves, come on! I suppose it was just an easy way to take advantage of people for her own financial gain 
 First of all, Jump is too good of a track. I still haven't heard the rest of this CD because I just put jump on repeat and rap at the top of my lungs on my 45 minute commute. It ends up being about 10 times each way to work and if I'm at a long light, I look a little nuts for rapping to the song twice, but like I've always told people, if yelling a rap song by 12 year olds at the top of your lungs is wrong, I don't want to be in prison. The other problem I have with this thing is that if you try to be like Kriss Cross, you can't hold a job. If you are a true Kriss Krosser, you braid your hair and wear your clothes backwards. I got a job with a bank when I graduated from the U of Phoenix and I showed up on my first day with my suit on backwards. I started getting a bunch of customer complaints and they would call my Manager, Mr. Gingercrap, up to tell me they had a problem with my attire. Little did they know that I wired the intercom system to play Jump by the rap kings. I just pushed play and got on the drive thru teller mic and busted a groove in my reverse suit. I got fired. Well, after getting fired six other times from places like Burger King, Jiffy Lube, Ted pants shack, Jorks and Microsubs I decided to be a roller rink cop. I make kids leave the floor if they skate too fast. If they resist my orders, I have a tazer that I use without hesitation. I usually whisper for them to leave the rink so they say they can't hear me. Stop! Tazer time!! They don't care how I dress and pay me like 5 buks an hour. Yup, I'm at another level 
 I have seen some bad ones in my day but this is the worst. I couldn't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life on it. They literally stole scenes from Runaway Train in this. Not the ideas, they stole the filmed scenes. The train kept going from one engine to the four in RT. The continuity was a joke. Had a semi truck go from tandem axle to single back to tandem. Seems like some of the actors must have had a house payment coming up 
 Bad reviews typically receive bad reviews. So be it. After several chapters of trying to decide whether the problem was me or the author, I simply gave up. This is no easy read. I don't think we gain much from an endless list of data. 
 While I found this book to be interesting, it was hard to follow and it most definitely needs an index 
 I was required to read this book for a class in college. I would never have picked it otherwise. I learned that these people are just as messed up as the rest of us, fighting and clawing their way through life. It was an honest depiction of lesbian life and I do commend it for this 
 I am completely frustrated and upset with the delivery, or lack thereof, of the magazine subscription I received as a gift of Romantic Homes.  This is my absolute favorite magazine and my husband purchased a year's subcription for me from Amazon.com for Christmas 2005!  I still haven't received ONE magazine (it's now July 2006).  Amazon assured me three times, over the past year, it was coming, it's now July and I still haven't received the magazine.  I am so disappointed at the lack of customer service.  I urge you to NEVER buy a magazine subscription from Amazon.com.  This has been a horrible experience and I cannot believe that it has somehow become okay to run a business in this matter.  I am tired of empty promises from Amazon.com while I am anxiously awaiting my magazine.  Not only have I not received my magazine, the "people" at Amazon have NEVER offered a refund, a renewed subscription, ANYTHING!  I realize it's a measly twenty-something dollars, but this business practice is horrible!  I am also tired of speaking to people that do not speak English and are trying to help me.  Please do better Amazon, this is terrible!  Shame on you!  
 King, Keohane and Verba (KKV) present an argument for unifying qualitative and quantitative methodologies in political science under one overall rubric.  However, the book falls short in several respects.  First, KKV have a tendency to repeat themselves.  They say the same thing over and over in different ways.  In other words, they replicate what they just said.  Duplication is a big problem as well. (Get the hint yet?)  More editing would have helped.  Second, not everything they say can be accepted at face value.  They take seemingly innocent ideas and state definitive conclusions, without letting the reader know that what they're saying overturns years of epistemological research into the nature of scientific research.  People who disagree with their perspective are brushed to the side.  Third, their attempt to unify qualitative and quantitative methods suffers from a bias to the quantitative side of things.  They first explain ideas in quantitative or statistical terms, use a formal analysis, and then state something like, "the same method can be used in qualitative analysis" without always saying how, precisely, that should be accomplished.  Sometimes, I grant, they provide qualitative examples, but those serve primarily as foils against which they base their hypothesis.  Qualitative researchers quoted by them tend to get torn to shreds by the end.  This book is usually required reading in research design/ research methods courses because it's been the source of most disagreements in political science methodology over the 10 years since its publication.  But if you don't have to read it for a class, don't bother 
 I recently purchased this item, and I was extremely disappointed.  It was a horrible experience trying to install this item.  The instructions for the drive did not match the type of drive, and on the western digital website, it didn't even list this drive to get instructions for.  So, I followed the instructions that came with it to a T, to install the drive as a boot drive, copying all my information from my current drive, which was about to fail.  It seemed to copy the files just fine and work ok as a slave drive, but then my original hard drive failed, and I moved this supposidly boot drive to be the single drive on my machine it would not work.  Upon calling customer service to find out what was wrong, I was asked, did you make the boot drive through windows or dos?  I told her I just popped in the disk they gave me and ran it, and followed the instructions, click on "I want to make a boot drive" and not on "I want to make a drive for additional service."  She said that it sounds like I did it through windows mode, and it won't make a boot drive in windows mode, only if I was in dos mode.  I asked her why this was not explained in the instructions, and now I had no original boot drive to try to do it again.  She told me to run windows recovery.  I asked if she could help me do that, because I couldn't figure it out, and she said no, windows isn't our product so we won't help you with that.  I said, but if this is what I need to install this drive, it says you are supposed to offer me free installation help for 30 days, why won't you help me.  Then I was spoken to as if I was a problem customer - you know, "MAAM, I TOLD YOU I CAN'T HELP YOU" in a nasty tone.  I ended up going out, buying another hard drive to use as my primary and then installing windows from scratch, and having to reinstall all the drivers and programs I had on this new drive and I kept the western digital drive for a backup.  All in all,  I thought this was a waste of money, a waste of hours upon hours of time, and a terrible experience.  I would never recommend purchasing this product 
 I returned this book, a first for me with Amazon.  I would have given the book 0 stars but that is not an option in the ratings program.  The data base for this 'research' is christian males.  This is not a book that most of us can relate to.  The book doesn't unmask anything except christian males are depressed.  The book information needs to say up front that it is all about people who center their lives around the church. If you've got a fish on the back of your car-buy this book, if you don't, don't it won't help you 
 In many ways this book is just as interesting as previous books in the series. Adams humor is in tact and will have you snickering fairly often.  The main problem is that of the overall plot. It is unsatisfying and pessamistic. Not just the ending. Tricia Mcmillian or Trillan turns from being a likable and symathetic character to somone who uses people and makes them clean up her mess. It is a heartbeakingly unfit end to a series I have such fondness for. This is compounded by the fact that the late Douglas Adams wished to write a sixth book after this one but never got around to it.   At this point it is better to consider the fourth book the final guide since it has such a satisfyingly beautiful end. For those who love the works of Adams should read it anyway, since it is well... a douglas adams book. Just dont be to dissapointed when you are dissapointed 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  First of all, too much time was spent writing about people/things that you would never hear about again after the first few chapters (i.e. Terrence, Sabrina, Rebecca, etc.).  Granted the author was setting the scene, but this book was not worth it.  I couldn't relate to the characters in any way except for Pearl and Patrick.  They seemed like the only normal and down to earth characters written.  This book is an example of how the highest people up (even African Americans) have more problems/self esteem issues than people who don't live lavish lives.  Barbara Bentley, an extremely passive woman when it came to her husband Bradford "The Rich Dog" Bentley, as I call him.  There is no way I would have allowed him to continue to do the things that he did.  Please don't say that she stayed for the money because as much dirt that she had on Bradford, she would have ended up with the house, a car, a resort/vacation home, and spousal or alimony support all at the voluntary expense of Bradford just to avoid humility.  Jolene was a straight up you know what!  This is a woman who would go to great lengths to live the life she never had, so she thought.  Let me run across a man like Patrick, and he wouldn't have even thought about looking at Pearl.  Although I did like that they hooked up, so I think.    This book was so open ended that you don't know what happened to whom.  It better be a sequel to this book, but unfortunately I not that interested in reading it.  The only reason I read this was for a book club meeting.  Being as though I live in P.G. County, it made me questions the author's motive.  To me the book was written from a condescending point of view of people who live in P.G. County a.k.a. "inside the beltway" as she would put it.  It's funny because even people who live in P.G. County don't refer to it in those terms, but then again maybe they do just not from the outside of the gated communities.  ** A note to all readers...This is a message from the avid readers association, DO NOT waste your time, unless you have time to kill and a book with no ending!** 
 The information printed by Amazon.com in their description of this book bears little relationship to the new Pelican paperback. The paperback is a facsimile of the 1911 edition. I myself wrote the description used here by  Amazon to describe the Pelican book. What I wrote refers to the Quellen  Company's enlarged and annotated edition, which has foreword and  introduction, and six appendices telling about the publication of the  original book, the two plays produced from the book, and the silent movie  made from it. Also, many illustrations not in the original book, or the  Pelican paperback. A lot of original research went into gathering and  putting together this material. I believe the description may convey an  erroneous impression to prospective purchasers of the Pelican book. I did  not authorize the use of this material to describe any other book than my  own, because, oviously, it does not describe any other book! Signed:  Quentin Burke, editor of the enlarged, interpretive edition of  "Barbara" and of the commemorative edition of  "Barbara." Both are hard cover and both are obtainable from  Amazon.com 
 Has nobody seen through Scorseses weak plots yet?  He makes one exellent gangster film (Goodfellas which after all was based on a book) then repeats the same formula for almost every other film.  So we have the Italian mafia in Goodfellas, the Jewish mafia in Once upon a time, back to the Italians but change location for Casino and now we have the Irish and 'native' mafia.  So what next for Scorsese when he runs out of ethnic groups for his mafia films?    This film lacks everything.  Loosely based on historical facts its slow, dull and only made vaguely interesting by the odd input of horrific violence (just as all of his gangster films are, the start of Goodfellas, the baseball bat scene in Casino etc)  Sorry but this film lacks everything. 
 I've read other books by Terry McMillian and really enjoyed them. "How Stella Got Her Groove Back" was a disappointment. From page one I didn't like Stella. She seemed to be in love with herself. Also the constant run on sentences were annoying. The story was a predictable fairy tale. Not recommended 
 This pedometer is so much cheaper (~$7) than the typical decent ones (that go for about $18 - $20).. now I know it is for a reason.. the buttons are flimsy, the package looks very cheap, the one I bought and presented to a senior citizen - did not work, also found that the Sr Citizen found it very hard to use the buttons on this little device.. terrible ergonomics/form factor.  Would recommend spending a bit more and getting the Omron/Oregon Sc  $18 pedometers - much better form factor, high reliability and quality 
 I wanted to rent In Like Flint because it is mentioned in the Austin Powers movie. Reviews on amazon said that Our Man Flint was better, so I checked that one out first. I actually liked Our Man Flint. It was NOT what I expected though. People make it out to be a mockery or parody of james bond films, but I didn't think it was. When I think of parody, I think of Airplane or Naked Gun movies. This was NOTHING like those. Sure, there were a couple of funny things, like the name of the secret government agency was W.O.W.I.E. and he had his super tool that had 80 secret functions (of which you never saw him use more than maybe 6). Our Man Flint had an interesting story, and you honestly wanted to know what happened next. Even though it's a fairly old movie, it didn't seem as dated as it could have been. I liked Our Man Flint and I would watch it again.  BUS, In Like Flint? What a bad movie. It had hardly anything of the interesting story that Our Man Flint had. In fact, I didn't even watch the ending, because I DIDN'T CARE WHAT HAPPENED! I should have known, In Like Flint got some pretty bad reviews here, but after watching Our Man Flint and enjoying it, I figured, how bad could it be? Well, it was pretty darn bad! Boring AND un-interesting. I would NOT reccomend In Like Flint, but I would reccomend Our Man Flint. After watching Our Man Flint, you'll laugh even harder when watching Austin Powers...especially when his super secret phone rings 
 I've seen better books that offer help in this area, but for the price I paid, it was still worth it.  My kids can use it to gain some insight.  It is very easy reading, too 
 I have two 8" picture frames that are other brands, and they are GREAT and I use them for Open Houses all the time! I got this one as a gift from a friend, and it is terrible!! The instructions are difficult to understand. The wide screen makes everyone in the picture look FAT and distorted! This is a weird size and I am not happy at all!! I don't recommend it 
 I ordered the audio cassette before I went into real estate sales, and I was somewhat disappointed. The advice was mostly common sense (for example, if it's snowing outside, take off your shoes before entering the house) but  not practical sales techniques. If you're looking to enter the sales  industry, I recommend books and tapes by Tom Hopkins and Brian Tracy 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 It seems extraordinary that a man who claims to write about the sixteenth century has omitted some of the key aspects of the period, such as the Crusades and The Norman Conquest.  This oversight is deeply criminal and  the book flounders for it 
 This has nothing to do with the book or movie...i just found it rather odd that the main character has my exact name. Im the real Jared Price...well not exactly the same because im straight with a loving girlfriend...but i found it odd that i googled my name and i find a book and a movie about a character with my full name 
 Those who are looking for an introduction to Saudi history will be disappointed with this book.  It is a polemic that, from beginning to end, seeks to persuade rather than to explain.    For example, the first anecdote (involving a civilian flight made by a Saudi royal while civilian traffic was shut down after 9-11) is presented with an almost lurid suggestiveness that is never quite backed up by facts.  In fact, there are explanations for this flight that do not signify the insidious influence of the Saudis that is the thesis of this book, one of which is that the prince involved, being on a flight piloted by a pilot with CIA clearence, had been present in the country on 9-11 and delegated to assist the American government in its post haste investigations of 9-11.  Try as you might, you can't find this contention assessed and rejected.  In fact, the CIA connection was only incidentally mentioned, and this unbalanced presentation is both typical of the book and not in the least conducive to developing an analytical understanding of Saudi-American relations.    More annoying than hyperbolic and unbalanced weighings of the facts is that accurate factual presentations are often so skillfully juxtaposed with other facts as to lead the incautious reader to draw conclusions that the author never quite draws, but may seem to have drawn.  If I say cats are feline and cunning, follow with another true remark to the effect that dogs like bones, and return to the discussion of cunning, it may appear to the incautious reader that I have established that dogs are cunning.  Mr. Posner's persuasive writing certainly certainly is.  This type of lawyerly deception is given even to plainly false contentions.   This book is one in a long line of charges and countercharges of either Israeli or Arab influence in the American government.  You will have no trouble establishing which side Mr. Posner prefers.  It is also one of the line of recent right wing polemics written for popular consumption and persuasion, offering only shallow and often illusory analysis that is unhelpful to understanding our complex relationship with the Saudis, substituting only shallow cliches for real understanding.  Its informational value is extremely limited, and in fact negative if someone lacks a prior background in pertinent facts.    For this reason, though it is an entertainingly written book, there are better ways for everyone, whether well versed or not, to spend an evening 
 What a bad book! terrible writing. Plotless story. Cardboard box characters. No descriptions. Ms. Malladi, please cease and desist from writing...especially your own 5 star reviews. Your work doesn't deserve publication even if you pay people to read it! 
 The first hint that this book is not an academic work of history is that the advance copies given to US reviewers were distributed to intellectual celebrities (writers such as Saul Bellow and Elie Wiesel, both of whom are quoted on the original hardback) rather than to major historians specializing in the region.  When the book was released in Britain, however, the late Albert Hourani of Oxford University, probably the foremost expert on modern Arab history, published a review.  I quote from his conclusion: "Ms. Peters has found, or been provided with, a large number of documents, but most are well-known, and many of them she misunderstands or quotes out of context.  She denounces British policy because she believes it broke the promise of the Balfour Declaration and the Mandate that Palestine 'east and west of the Jordan river' should become a 'Jewish homeland.'  But the Declaration carefully avoided saying that Palestine should become a 'Jewish homeland;' and the British decision to set up an Arab princedom in Transjordan, and exclude it from the area in which a Jewish national home should be created, was in accordance with the terms of the Mandate. "Her argument that enormous numbers of Arabs came illegally into Palestine also has no basis.  One of her few pieces of evidence is a statement made by an obscure Syrian official in 1934 that more than 30,000 Syrians had entered Palestine and settled there during a few months.  The Permanent Mandates Commission asked a British representative for his opinion of this, and he said it was 'grossly exaggerated.'  Ms. Peters quotes the statement by the Syrian official but not the British reply; on the next page the statement becomes 'verified by an official international document;' a little later it has become 'hard evidence,' in the light of which British statements to the contrary can be dismissed as fallacious. "The whole book is written like this: facts are selected or misunderstood, tortuous and flimsy arguments are expressed in violent and repetitive language.  This is a ludicrous and worthless book and the only mildly interesting question is why it comes with praise from two well-known American writers."       Several other reviewers have argued that Norman Finklestein's 'debunking' of this work has itself been 'debunked.'  I am not familiar with any serious efforts at such 'debunking,' but as they may exist I will not get into his criticisms of the work at hand.  I will, however, quote from the late Edward Said's essay "Conspiracy of Praise."  In response to the claim that Peters was sympathetic to the Palestinian cause when she began her project but then discovered 'the truth:' "[Peters] wrote an article, 'An Exchange of Populations,' in the August 1976 issue of "Commentary," where her notions about inveterate Arab anti-Semitism are trundled forth, along with the exchange-of-Arabs-for Jews idea, all in a prose quite free of sympathy for the poor Arab refugees."   Said on a couple specific points in this work:  "What neither [Norman Finklestein and Bill Farrell] noted, however, is that the last census for Palestine was done under British mandate in 1931.  No population estimates of twentieth-century Palestine can avoid its findings which show a vast native Arab majority.  Peters totally ignores that census...instead she relies on Ottoman statistics for the 1890s...[and] use[s] medieval historian Makrizi as an eye-witness source about nineteenth-century Palestine."   "...Peters misleadingly badnies about population figures for 'Jewish settled areas' but does not reveal that those areas amounted only to 4 or 5 percent of the whole country, or - a slightly more subtle tactic - that figures for Christian Arabs are simply left out."    The late Mssrs. Said and Hourani were two of 20th century academia's finest experts on Middle Eastern and Arab affairs.  To ignore their critiques in favor of "someone with no academic credentials, and only the sketchiest foreign policy and press background" [taken from Said's essay] would be utterly irresponsible.  
 I usually enjoy Ms. Maron's Deborah Knott books very much. The characters are well drawn and give deep insight into Southern life. This one, however, is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional. The first murder doesn't seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just "there". The second one involving Dwight's son (who is a very poorly developed child character) and his ex wife is not very interesting.   I devoutly hope this was the nadir of the series and it will improve after this. Probably not, though-I foresee several storylines involving husband/stepmother/stepchild conflicts. Glad I checked it out from the library and didn't purchase it outright..do the same and don't waste your money 
 This novel is totally "stream of consciousness."  It jumps around through past and present.  It's impossible to follow any kind of coherent plot.  I had enjoyed the movie "LA Confidential" and thought I wanted to read Ellroy.  I was mistaken! 
 I usually read Stephen King for his interesting ideas and imagery and expect his books to read fast and well. I've read three previous King books that have had the occasional long passages with overstated depictions of horror, doom, and grotesquery in order to immerse his readers into the tone of his story.  This one takes the cake because what is meant to read as terror and horror is really ridiculous and unimaginative. And this is exactly what "Insomnia" is. This isn't a spoiler, just the author's note: at the end of the book we read Sep. 10, 1990- Nov 10, 1993- three years in which King took to write this book.  Three years which were evidently wasted.  The other King books I've read were engrossing for their characterizations and character identification.  "Insomnia's" Ralph Roberts is certainly a character the reader could identify with.  He is strong, kind, has traditional gentlemanly views on aiding women in distress and regards them as beautiful and respectable. His counterpart Lois Chasse doesn't come across as identifiable. Instead she serves as a  secondary character who has no real flair or identity other than being in love with Ralph. King doesn't usually do that with his secondary characters.  Other characters with much smaller roles in this book come across as real and identifiable, like Ed and Helen Deepenau, the three bald doctors, and Ralph's numerous confidantes.  Then there's the whole abortion mess. This central political issue crumbles midway thru and seems to serve no purpose at all in the story. Though King does provide an interesting and seemingly objective commentary on the issue via Detective Leydecker (albeit with a tranparently pro-choice slant), it serves no relevance to the theme of the story but just hangs there on display used for no more than a story device.    I gave the book two stars because I am an inspiring writer and reading this provided me with some of the devices that are important to utilize as part of a writer's arsenal. The devices were obvious and all thru the reading I asked myself, 'How is King going to get through this?' His weapon of choice was most often Ralph Robert's narration (via third person) that analyzed the events of the story and interpreted its meaning and significance. It seemed whenever King was in trouble in the story, he would use Ralph as his solution and let him think it out and guide it for him. This is a useful tool for a beginning writer, but King used it as a crutch to tell a story that had no pulse from the beginning.  One last thing, the villians just don't work. They are not frightening, they are not demonic, they are not vicious or malign. Three little bald doctors with scalpels and scissors? Their defining characteristics are being small and bald- does that really frighten anyone? The real villian among them dances around and jump ropes to reveal his evil madness. Then there's the Crimson King, the evil supernatural mastermind we read about from page 100 who finally enters the story on page 550 as a Catfish in one of the most terrible, anti-climactic scenes ever rendered.  I rest my case.               
 First I quit buying books with Ludlum's name on them, then I quite reading them . . . that was years ago and this mess brings it all back.  I received the Bancroft Strategy as a birthday present from my daughter who takes gift-giving very personally, so I had to keep it.  The only reason I give it 2 Stars is because I'm still reading it, waiting for two DeMille books I ordered to arrive.  The stuff in this book is just plain D U M B.  Definitely don't waste your money, and don't waste your time, unless you have a good reason to do so, like someone else's feelings 
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 . .If you could sue writers for false advertising regarding what they write on bookjackets, you'd have a great case against these two! This book rehashes old legends and stories but provides nothing new. In fact, it does not even provide a good synopsis of what allegedly occurred during the "experiment", providing only bits and pieces along the way. It actually sounds like an addendum to some previous work that assumes you have heard all the cool details, and provides you with a few coincidences that the authors assume support their case. A don't know much about William L. Moore, but I used to read all Charles Berlitz's books when I was a kid, as I thought the Bermuda Triangle made for some great stories. But as I got older, I realized that that's all they were. Charles Berlitz never made any groundbreaking discoveries while "researching" his Bermuda Triangle books, just rehashed old sailor's tales. I recall him during a guest spot on the "Larry King Live" program, and when I Coast Guard officer called in and provided known, verifiable details on some of his "without a trace" cases, Berlitz looked like a monkey. As a former Coast Guard Rescue Pilot myself, stationed for 3 years in Borinquen, Puerto Rico (one of the apexes of the "Triangle"), I can also assure you that it is quite easy for an aircraft or moderately sized vessel to "disappear without a trace", and that there is nothing mysterious about it. . .it's a big ocean! I witnessed the indistinct horizons and other phenomena, all of which had perfectly good explanations. Save yourself some money and avoid all books that have Charles Berlitz's name associated with them unless you're reading them for "entertainment purposes only" 
 Initially intrigued with this book, I quickly lost interest.  It starts out well but then degenerates into a bunch of random points which the author tries to use to argue his hypothesis that the universe was designed to give rise to intelligent life as a final outcome.  The blurbs along the margin were major distractions & made it hard to stay focused on the actual material in the book.  The book just kind of wanders around the various fields of science trying to find evidence to support the author's premise and then ends with the pronouncement that we're the peak of creation (very Genesis-like).  I'd have to pronounce this book mildly interesting if you can wade through the claptrap and the biased agenda 
 Atricles are teribly organaized and nothing is followed through. For instace this book starts with explaination on how to render water. First article indicates that good way to do it would be by summing sin waves and then goes on with derivation. Yet a lot of questions are not answered such is sum of sines is used to represent one wave? multiple waves? all the waves? Graphs that suposed to explain equations are done in 2D, while equations themselfs are in 3D (and difference in drammatic). Then article indicates that sin sums do not represent water waves very well and moves to another equation (which leaves a question of why did they waste time with derivations?) It is also not clear on how this data, from ether equation is going to be used (such as to displace a vertex? or use it for bump mapping, or maybe something else) Other articles seems to bounce a lot too without explaining anything in depth. NVidia examples a tad better (but they cover less interesting points IMHO), thus one star vs zero. There are often no exmples for the topics covered which only makes it harder to understand (for instance i really wanted to see some for article about improving perspective shadow maps). I guess this is expected as good coders are often not so great at writing, but I guess at this price I expected more. Ohh and yes book is very nicely printed, fully in color 
 I agree with some of the other reviewers that the selection of sketches here is not as good as it could have been.  Gilda Radner was a very talented comedy actress but this DVD does not showcase enough of her best work.  Sure, the dance number with Steve Martin is a classic, as are a couple of the commercials such as "Hey, You," but too many of these sketches show her playing a little girl, Lisa Loopner or the usually gross Roseanne Roseannadanna.  It focuses too much on her as an individual, not the integral part of the SNL ensemble that she was.  One of the major mistakes the producers of this and the other SNL videos I have seen is that when they take the sketches out of context they are much less funny in isolation than in the flow of a regular show.  I was disappointed with this, I didn't chuckle as much as I thought I would and had to skip through many of the sketches because they either rapidly got boring, or gross.  I won't be getting any more of these SNL compilation DVDs because they simply don't know how to produce them so that they are funny.  I noticed a similar problem with an SNL 25th anniversary compilation.  I think perhaps these are written and produced by the same people who write and produce the current SNL show -- which is very rarely even amusing and usually just a waste of time 
 Graphic novels are in, and graphic novels about the Holocaust, keying off of Art Spiegelman's MAUS, command our attention both for their subject matter and for the way they present it. Unfortunately, Miriam Katin's WE ARE ON OUR OWN, does not do a good job on either count.   As it happens, shortly before writing this review I spent a couple of hours in a bookshop in New York City that specializes in graphic novels and comic books. I soon realized that most of the graphics in the novels are poor at best. Interestingly, the best ones are done by Europeans who, it seems, are still trained as artists, something that I'm not sure we can say about their American counterparts. Katin's graphics are better than some, but still not especially compelling. They soon lose what visual interest they have.   Nor does the story redeem the uninteresting graphics. As it also happens, this novel is not about the Holocaust, but about the experiences of Katin and her mother, Hungarian Jews who, in 1944, purchased false identity papers and went on the run, staying in Hungary and finding shelter with two or three Hungarian peasant families. In the meantime, Katin's father was fighting with the Hungarian Army. I don't want to minimize the experiences of any refugee when I say that Katin and her mother were singularly fortunate - though occasionally suspected to be Jews, they were never turned in by their hosts; they survived the war and, at war's end, were reunited with Katin's father. They went on to stay in Hungary until 1956, when they left in the aftermath of the Hungarian Uprising.   The title reflects Katin's loss of faith in God, a loss that grew out of Katin's experiences, but the story she presents is simply not compelling. Elie Wiesel survived the concentration camps, the only one in his family to do so, yet he has made his peace with God, and he is hardly the only Holocaust survivor to do that. For far less powerful reasons, Katin wants to share with us her loss of faith, though she could as easily have found the hand of God in her and her parents' survival.   Were it not for the current demand for graphic novels and for Katin's attempt to connect her story with the Holocaust - a connection that barely exists - I'm not sure this book would ever have been published. If you must read a graphic novel that is compelling and is truly about the Holocaust, read MAUS. 
 I tried reading this book but found it so turgid and poorly written that I put it down in frustration.  It reads like a translation from another language by an academic bureacrat. The theme is interesting, the execution poor.  Cannot recommend 
 Just a couple of pages in this book are actually about the process of quilting itself. There is a long part about the history of quilts (quite good if you are interested in that), a gallery of quilts (beautifully  quilted) and general instructions on materials and planning a quilt. The  author also tries to explain how to make a quilting design fit the size of  your own quilt but that is done very poorly. I have seen much better  instructions in other books. The quilting part is okay but it is just a few  pages. This is definitely not a book every quilter needs even if you prefer  hand quilting to machine quilting 
 What this book preaches is starvation, pure and simple. This is a very old book, wherein the author makes many unsubstantiated glowing statements, and unfortunately many people, including myself, were drawn into the craze of attempting to find the "superior health" that Ehret promised, only to be left with broken health because of having done so. My first introduction to the book came about 1963, although I did not really try to live Ehret's recommendations fully until about 1966. Being young and gullible I took everything Professor Ehret said as absolutely true. This was a big mistake. I believe this book came very close to killing me, as I am already prone to low-blood sugar, without starving myself.  This book and other fanatical ideas about eating were responsible for giving health consiousness a bad name when I was young, and I am concerned that even today there are those attempting to live the tenets of this book, who do their bodies a great harm, as well as ruin any chances of a normal social life.  A much better approach is a simple diet made up of fresh grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables, with a little seeds and nuts; and no refined food and no oil. You do not have to starve yourself to be healthy, and long-term starvation is not healthy by any standard. Dr. Caldwell B. Esselstyn and Dr. T. Colin Campbell are names you should research if you want the best information available about healthy eating, which is at the same time livable, leading not only to normal weight, but also normal cholesterol and clean blood vessels, as well as a much lower chance of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, arthritis and all other diseases of affluence.  Put another way, Ehret's book may do some good if the reader is not fanatical about it, and does not adhere to its tenets of near starvation for too long. There is nothing wrong with fasting, but fasting is for cleansing, not for everyday life 
 Mr. Yancey has no respect for the teaching of the Bible.  God is always there when it hurts.  In fact, God allows hurt.  Look at Book of Job.  God allowed Satan to kill Job's children (!!!) and tempt his wife away from Job and give Job a horrible disease.  God was always there.  In fact, God was a part of the plan to CAUSE Job to suffer.  Why?  On a whim.  Satan said that Job would lose faith if disaster struck him, so God said, "Okay, give it your best shot!"  Sometimes, God sends disasters into your home for a whim, for a wager with Satan.  This is the lesson from the Book of Job.  Sometimes, God Himself brings pain and death because Christians refuse to uphold the interests of the Kingdom of Christ.  Look at the book of Jeremiah.  It was God who chose to kill Israelites, destroy the Jerusalem Temple.  In fact, Jeremiah specifically states that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was not a believer, was anointed by God to bring destruction.  It's like God anointing Bin Laden to destroy America.  That would be the similar analogy in terms of anointing a hostile unbeliever to destroy a believing nation.  The Bible is clear that God chose King Nebuchadnezzar to destroy the Jerusalem Temple and kill Israelites.  And anyone who opposed King Nebuchadnezzar opposed God Himself.  How does this apply to Bin Laden.  This is how seriously God takes desecration of His House, the Christian Church.  God will raise up an unbelieving enemey to destroy America if America desecrates God's houses.  And opposing this anointed enemy would be opposing God Himself.  Mr. Yancey should think seriously about what God teaches about suffering.  God gives suffering when believers desecrate His house.  God sends death and destruction when Christians refuse to uphold the interst of Christ.  This is an important lesson for America to learn 
  From an archaeologist's point of view, that the "artifact" used for show and tell is a wood hoop with strings (and would not be preserved in most archaeological contexts) is the minor problem. The major problem is that Great Aunt Jane, the archaeologist, has an "artifact" in her trunk instead of in a curation facility.  Ethical archaeologists do not keep the artifacts they find.  The book could have Arnold find a replica made of one of Auntie's discoveries. In its favor, the book does emphasize "it's not what you find [i.e. the artifact] but what you find out" that's important 
 The story of Wim Wenders' "Wings of Desire" is told through images and thoughts.  Abandon all expectations of seeing anything resembling a conventional film before watching it.      Two angels glide through the streets of Berlin surveying its inhabitants.  Cassiel (Otto Sander) embraces his role as witness but Damiel (Bruno Ganz) wants to break free of his ethereal existence.  He is willing to cast aside his immortality in order to experience the simple joys of everyday life.  The primary catalyst for his desire to change is his attraction to trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin).   "Wings of Desire" does not quite work.  It stumbles not because it is too pretentious or too ponderous.  Rather, it stumbles because it is just too abstract.   Relying on imagery and monologues to tell a story makes for an interesting lesson in unconventional filmmaking, but it also leads to frustration and annoyance to anyone conditioned to more traditional narratives.  "Wings of Desire" deserves a lot of credit for its innovative approach toward its material and its beautiful dream-like visuals.  Yet, it is a film that unfortunately will not appeal much to the mainstream viewer.  
 Mostly I got this book because I never owned it and do own Little Women and Jo's Boys.I want my daughter to have the trilogy.I thought it was terrible.A mere series of goody-goody character sketches with very little holding it all together. If anything, it just underscored how Jo should have accepted Teddy! They were a great pair.I did not care about these boys much and even had trouble distinguishing them from one another.Jo's Boys was much better--at least a novel, so read Little Men only to fill in the blanks 
 I bought this book, then I recieved an invitation to review this book, but I can not do it because the book never arrived to my home (of course they took the money out of my credit card). I guess I wil have to buy it somewhere els 
 The title of this book is very misleading! The Worldwide Church of God did not need to be liberated from anything.  Those who were its members at the time of the death of Herbert Armstrong were content with its basic doctrines.  It was a growing and thriving church, with its mission of preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ to the whole world as a witness.  It was not a cult; it did not twist anyone's arm to join it. In fact, it was content to remain relatively small in overall numbers. Members were free to come and go as they pleased, and if they did not agree with its doctrines that differed from "mainstream Christianity," (such as keeping the 7th day Sabbath, and observing "Jewish" Holy days such as Passover, the Day of Atomement, etc. instead of Easter, Christmas, etc.) then the WCG would recommend that they not attend its services!    But with the death of Armstrong in 1986, the leadership of the WCG fell into the hands of Joseph Tkach, his son, and others like Mike Feazell.  At first they deceived the membership by pretending to remain loyal to the original doctrines of the Church. Then, near the end of his life, Joseph Tkach began to make wholesale changes.  These changes escalated under the pastorship of his son, Joe Tkach, Jr., who succeeded him. The Destruction, not the Liberation of the WCG was now in full gear. The membership of the WCG saw the sad mismanagement of Tkach and Feazell, and began to leave in droves. The WCG owned two beautiful and first rate college campuses, one in east Texas, and the other in Pasadena, CA. These campuses, along with many other assets the WCG owned, have now been sold off and the proceeds pocketed by the elite group (ie Tkach and Feazell, et al) who now control the remanant of the WCG.  Herbert Armstrong was a man of vision who was instrumental in building a worldwide Work. The current church leadership is merely a bunch of little, greedy men who have built nothing! They did not liberate the WCG, but hijacked it and plundered its wealth for their own personal gain. I wonder Who will liberate it from them!! 
 As a (once) big Jurassic 5 fan, I couldn't believe how terrible this album was.  The lyircs got old fast, the beats were boring and like another reviewer mentioned, I got sick of the whole "girl/getting over shyness" type of songs.  This album reminded me of a no-name group that wants to get big fast so their label puts a whole bunch of big name stars on the album to gain more fans and radio play...NOT what I would expect from a solid group like J5 at all!      Power in Numbers was just okay to me, and they totally lost me with this latest release; I will not be buying another J5 album from here on out.  It's no wonder Cut Chemist left the group.. 
 While this book contains a ton of data, don't get it if you want calorie counts on anything homemade.  If you look up french toast, for example, it only gives information on name brand items.  Much of the information in the book is available on the packaging of the products.  I suppose that if you wanted to check it before shopping, or use it before eating out, it would be helpful.  But if you want to find out the caloric content of any homemade items, you are out of luck with this book 
 Lord, where to begin with this unholy mess.   Polaris' on-again-off-again insanity - it was never clear if Austen actually even understood that he'd written good old level headed, genius IQ Lorna Dane as a raving nutcase - he's so clueless as to how to write a convincing character he seems to have thought she was just behaving normally when he decided to have her longtime boyfriend inexplicably dump her for a fairly demented nurse (Annie, who seemingly tried to prove every point she was trying to make by offering to sleep with someone) no one ever gave the least little damn about.   The sudden reappearance of Xorn - but it's not Xorn...Xorn never actually existed, no that was um...someone pretending to be Magneto pretending to be someone called Xorn....so this is that Xorn's twin brother...also named Xorn...although the first Xorn never actually existed...did he?....but this is his brother anyway....he also has the healing powers that the first non-existant Xorn turned out to not actually have...and where that first Xorn - who never actually existed, I kind of maybe think - had a star for a head, this Xorn has a black hole. Geez, after reading this I can definitely relate.  The XMen go to China! They are attacked! Why? No one knows! They have to get Xorn's helmet on him or his black hole head will swallow the world! The Chinese know where it is! They tell the XMen to go get it! Why don't they get it themselves? More fighting! Iceman and Juggernaut take a break from fighting the Chinese to fight each other! Why? No one knows! Gambit is blinded! Why? No one knows!  The Brotherhood attacks Philadelphia! Why? No one knows! The XMen are there waiting for them! Why? No one knows! Nurse "I'll sleep with you if you argue with me" Annie decides to leave! Why? No one knows! The Brotherhood attacks the mansion! Why? No one knows! Xorn can now control his black hole head, although the entire point of the last story was that he couldn't! Why? No one knows! Annie and her son Carter, who people cared about even less than her, have a cryptic conversation about his imaginary friend as they leave the mansion! Why? No one knows!  Chuck Austen got paid to write this! Why? No one knows!  If there is any justice in the world, Chuck Austen is now mopping the floor at 7-11 
 Several books have pushed the use of differential forms (DF).  Gravitation is one of them, as is the classical mechanics text by Arnold.  To be sure, DF are useful, connecting Stoke's theorem with Green's theorem in higher dimensions.  YET, Jackson's 3rd ed. electrodynamics text mentions no forms.  Nor do most (the vast majority) of physics text book use forms.  We use Gibbs' vector calculus, and tensors without ever really using forms.  The use of forms, thus, makes Gravitation an oddball text, and a very, very wordy one at that.    If one is desiring to do General Relavitity (GR) for a living, then by all means one should struggle through Gravitation.  However, if one is trying to learn GR at an introductory level, then use Nightingale!  This thin book gets to the point fast.  It develops the Riemannian geometry needed to solve the main GR problems with no bs.  More advanced texts are then needed to treat gravitational waves beyond the linearized theory, and to treat rotating point sources.  But a mastery of Nightingale is the first, essential step before progressing to Gravitation and other more advanced texts on GR.  Alex Alaniz Ph.D.  1.

 Although a pretty kettle, and with a wide enough base to support a full flame on commercial range such as Viking or Wolf, the inside became pitted and rusted within months. When I inquired from LeCreuset, they explained that it was not an isolated incident, but rather that they had been having problems with the vendor that produced this particular item. Unless you are looking for a disposable teapot you will have to replace within 6 months, stay away from this on 
 This could be a valuable text with lots of practice questions. But any good qualities are totally overshadowed by its numerous errors. If you are forced to use this book for a class, be sure to find the errata listings on its associated web page early in the semester 
 I'm sorry but despite some brilliant acting performances from Hopkins and Thompson this has got to be one of the most BORING movies I've ever tried to sit through. Don't be fooled by artsy film snobs, this one is a snoozer. And oh by the way, the tenacious "loyalty, devotion and integrity" of Hopkins character that so many critics think is the cornerstone of the film, is in my opinion, distracting and ridiculous 
 Erickson, a notorious communist and bogus half baked historian is not to be trusted with his works, all based on bogus, doctored and unrelaible Soviet semi fictions intended to advance the cause of Bolshevik invincability. 
 In "Iron John," Robert Bly announces that American men are all unhappy because the pressures of civilization have caused them to lose touch with their innate maleness.  He illustrates his point with one of the Brothers Grimm's more obscure (and frankly less interesting) stories, interpreting it as an allegory that just happens to prove his point.  He also draws heavily on Freudian and Jungian theories.  He proves his point in the same way Freud and Jung proved theirs' i.e. by saying "This is what I see, I am the expert, so that makes it true, Occham's Razor be darned."  Bly offers no objective evidence to support his positions, nor does he allow room for the possibility of other interpretations or, heaven forbid, that his observations might be wrong.  For example, Bly asserts that men become unhappy around the age of 35 (conveniently neglecting to site research supporting this assertion, despite his objective tone).  Bly explains that this is because at that age men begin to realize that their childhood dreams will not come true.  He does not consider that by age 35, most men have realized that they don't really want to be firemen.  Could this alleged unhappiness possibly be due to media influences that require unhappy customers to sell products to (such as self-help books)?  Naw, it's gotta be that "dreams" thing.  Bly also describes a case where students during the Viet Nam war broke into their college presidents' office to look for proof that the college was collaborating with the CIA.  Bly states that this happened because of the mistrust in male authority figures, because their fathers left home to work, preventing their sons from seeing how men work.  Bly does not consider the possibility that the students may have been righteously angry about the war and confused by their anger.  No, there had to be a "real" reason for the break-in, and aren't we lucky to have Robert Bly to tell us what it is?  Along the way, Bly overloads his writing with literary references, all carefully interpreted to suit his purposes.  It's all very pretentious, er uh, interesting, but so what?  I could interpret the same passages to mean something else.  If I lived at the time the passages were written, my interpretation would most likely be very different, despite Bly's insistence that his ideas are timeless and universal.  Bly' obsession with literary images does more than bog his writing down, however.  It underscores what is wrong with his whole premise.  He tries to build up the notion of the tragedy of lost male identity as objective fact, but uses only subjective views (many not his own and possibly taken wildly out of context) to support the idea.  Sorry Bob, you can't have it both ways.  One gets the impression that "Iron John" was cynically written to fill a niche.  Like all self-help books, "Iron John" targets a specific audience, tells them they are not happy, and insists that only by following his directions can they truly be happy.  Bly's target audience is White men who went to college and felt left out of the various political movements.  If you do not need a political movement to define who you are, then "Iron John" is not for you 
 This book is not for someone who already understands how a computer works.  It is confusing, and in no way can hold your attention for more than a paragraph.  The descriptions of the PIC architecture are vague and poorly drawn.  It was much easier to understand how the Microchip line works just by reading their  manuals.  If Mr. Predko really holds this level of relationship with this line of products then he is to be commended, because it is outside the realm of practical use.  All this aside, it really is useful for some small code snippets and practical interfacing.  Just for that it is worth the money.  Don't count on the book to actually deliver insight on the machines operation 
 during startup, it asks if you have audio. as i don't like talking apps, i click "no" - no audio. it starts blabbing. kill the audio on the computer.  the lack of flexibility is irritating but it doesn't take much to convert a pdf into some other format.  contrary to some reviews, it worked okay on osx.  i won't be buying any other orman products, thanks .. 
 I was assigned this book for a teaching certification course and I have never seen a worse textbook in my life.  It's full of long lists of terms that are never explained.  The visuals are confusing.  It's incredibly wordy.  I think the same information could easily be condensed down to a short pamplett if they just took out all of the redundancy 
 Hamilton should work all this out on the shrink's couch, and in the meantime we should spend our book money on somebody else.  No excuse for anything she's written in this series since Obsidian Butterfly 
 "Internal Combustion" by Edwin Black is an entertaining but uneven history about the control of energy with a purported emphasis on the ascendancy of the gasoline-powered automobile. To his credit, Mr. Black has managed a substantive research project that has uncovered a great deal of arcane historic information about the automotive industry. Unfortunately, this preachy book suffers from an acute lack of focus, where it is suspected that the large amounts of extraneous background material was added in an attempt to obscure the book's shortcomings. Indeed, the author ultimately fails to prove his central thesis, thereby casting doubt about the validity of both his research and his conclusions.  Mr. Black opens the book with a scene depicting the burning of Thomas Edison's research laboratories in December, 1914. Mr. Black's conspiracy theory proposes that sinister forces aligned with the gasoline-burning automotive industry may have intentionally destroyed the world's one and only hope to mass-produce an electric car. Unfortunately, Mr. Black provides no evidence to prove this allegation.    Mr. Black attempts to buttress his case by explaining that electric vehicles were once utilized as taxis in New York and other major cities in the late nineteenth century and, therefore, could have and should have been mass marketed to an appreciative public. We are supposed to accept Mr. Black's thesis that success would have been an inevitable and logical outcome despite the severe weight, cost and range limitations of the electric car when compared with the gasoline automobile. In fact, while Thomas Edison and Henry Ford were still tinkering with an electric alternative a full thirteen years after gasoline-powered vehicles had already been in mass production, it is evident to the reader that internal combustion vehicles prevailed because they were affordable, the first to market and could traverse longer distances than electric cars. That all of this was not a good development for people's health and the environment is not in dispute; rather, it is Mr. Black's contention that the white-hatted purveyors of electric vehicles could have prevailed save for the obstructionism of the black-hatted petroleum industry that remains in question.    In the end, what is conspicuously lacking throughout the book is a credible attempt at analyzing and critiquing the history of governmental and popular struggle with the fossil-fuel industry. But instead of scholarship, we have a vainglorious author who is determined to salvage the barren results of two years' worth of study by substituting analysis with a highly questionable work of narrative. The end result is little more than a masquerade of nonfiction; at best, it is a book that might have limited appeal to readers who crave pseudo-historicism at the expense of intellectual rigor, consistency, insight or coherence. 
 I received this reacher as a gift when I broke my ankle and could not reach things very well.  I find it very awkward to use and it feels clumsy. The very tip of the pick up part does not meet when you close the jaws, making it impossible to pick up very small items. It does not have a locking feature which is helpful sometimes. I purchased a "Pik Stik" which I find to be far superior. It has a gun type grip and it has the locking feature. It is strong with an aluminum shaft and the jaws grip well including the tips which close and allow small items to be picked up. It also comes in several lengths to suit your particular needs. The jaws can be rotated and locked increasing it's usefulness. The Pic Stik is also less expensive. I do NOT recommend the Medline reacher. Go for the Pic Stik and you'll be much happier with your choice 
 A friend of mine told me that this was a great cd. Now i do like they might be giants but this is crude compaired to Flood or Lincon. Which were much better     Only about 3 song are any good. Skip this one and get Floo 
 Seeing other reviews of this book left me feeling slightly confussed. Personally, I found it horrible. It was full of stories that had been writen so long after the event, that it had lost all emotion tied to it. However, Sixteen has appeared on many " Greastest Teen Books..Ever!" lists, although might I add so did the WHOLE Princess diarys series, which lost them a bit of credability.  A compelation of , in my opinion, a little too-short, short stories, Sixteen just doesn't have any meat to it. I was required to read it over the summer, otherwise I would probably have quit less than halfway through. Don't waste ya money.If you must...check it out 
 Jackson's ego is so overinflated that true knowledge of beer is obscured by his presence.  This book is boring, silly, and a waste of money.  It is also, like its author, shockingly overrated 
 [the above is an actual quote from the book]  I don't usually read romances, but got this one at the library.  I thought: Thriller.  Hijacked plane, navy seal...all the right stuff.  And the beginning was promising.  Stan fixes everything, and has a human side to him that was compelling.  Then the plot hit the fan!  As a thriller it stunk.  The highjacking was interwoven into the plot weakly, as an after thought.  The romantic "tension" between the protagonists was forced and irritating.  The dialogue is mundane.  The message that horniness leads to true romantic (Sam and Alyssa) love is rubbish.  The only worthwhile character was the highjacked girl, and I think it was brave of the author to not have her come out unscathed.  The historic (WWII) componant was interesting.  But overall, I kept asking who the audience is for this book.  Not lovers of thrillers like me--and I wonder, do romance readers even care about a highjacked plane, or was that just getting in the way of wondering whether Teri will ever tell Sam that she loves him! 
 This is the worst company I have ever dealt with. They offer 30 day trial on this product, I wasn't happy and mailed it back to them in 5 days of purchase and I'm still waiting for the refund. I have called them 3 times, it has been almost 4 months now without a refund. I would never buy a Nova product from this company again and I would recomend everyone going somewhere else to get good customer service 
 I ordered this book on 6/30/2006, and here we are 1 month later, and still nothing.  I have been notified twice to "update my order".  which basically meant to approve yet another delay for my package.  I love Taschen books, I would love it even more if i could get the darn thing.  
 I disliked this book so much that I had to put it down frequently.  First of all, the book is laid out in an illogical manner, with information spread out over chapters called Day 1, Day 2, Week 1, Week 2, Month 1, Month 2, etc.  If you want to read all the information on a particular topic, you won't find it in one place, and that can be frustrating.  Secondly, Becker's attitude is "Once a diabetic, always a diabetic".  She leaves little hope that by dieting and exercising you can return your body to a normal state, even if your diabetes isn't severe (this is in contradiction to what many doctors say).  Becker seems jaded to me and is obviously tired of dealing with her own diabetes, and her negativity is very evident in the book.  She doesn't understand the power of suggestion to help or hinder people; and since she doesn't have any faith in the human body to regenerate itself (once your beta cells are gone, they're gone!!!), she conveys this hopelessness to the reader.  Her sense of humor is laced with irony and reflects her negative attitude, and she uses humor to pander to the fears of her readers.  She seems to think that all her readers are in a state of "shock" from their diagnoses.  Throughout the section about taking blood sugar readings, she kept saying "Ouch" as if in sympathy with the reader (even though modern blood sugar meters are mostly painless).  The pandering can become irritating to a reader with a more mature attitude.  Having said all that, there is nonetheless a great deal of information in the book; but to get it all, you have to ward off her negative bullets with your magic bracelets -- and that may be difficult for people who are new to diabetes.  I DON'T recommend this book 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
   This is not to fault the vendor from whom I purchased this item used, the price as new was even more. And not to question the information enclosed therein: it's probably fairly accurate and all that. But to use the word "book" as a physical description is misleading. Try a handfull of paper squares with a couple of staples banged into the middle and folded over. I've seen free handouts with a more substantial construction. A fair price for this should be somewhere south of 3 dollars I would guess. Or better yet, the information should be up on a website where it can be viewed and downloaded for free. (Hmmm, there's an idea)   So do what I should have done if I'd been using my noodle. Go to the reference section of your local library and use the copy machine. And take the money you saved and buy a real book.    
 The remote would be fine, except it will not allow you to "punch through" the volume to your receiver, only your TV. This makes the whole thing pretty useless.   Our home theater, like almost everyone's, uses our surround theater for sound. Why you can't punch through the volume controls to it is completely baffling. I did a web search and it's apparently baffling to everyone else as well.  Back to the store it goes! Utterly worthless 
 Are we all mad???? No really?   This is a nice book.   Well presented and well-made but it is blank book and how much does it cost?   The Book of Shadows is a sacred book of spells, recipes and feelings.   It does not have to be leather(look)-bound and cost a fortune.   It is the content which is valuable not the coverings.  Sorry to be so negative.   Blessed be 
 This book is a pioneering effort to simplify network analysis for the unitiated but... there are too many eccentricities and mistakes for this tome to be taken seriously as either  a technical guide (see Wasserman and Faust) or a sociological simplification 
 If you have really loved the other boleyn girl by the same author...then this book will be disappointing as it does not have the thrill factor like the other one did. This book failed to engage me and I had to put it down several times. The author must have done extensive research but emphasis is done more on the plants/garden than on the actual story. I Usually finish reading off an entire novel within 3-4 days but this one has been laying around for the last 3-4 weeks 
 I was 17 when this film came out. My girlfriend and I had just invented sex. We were enthusiastic about our invention. After sitting through this movie, we didn't have sex for more than a week. We were seventeen years old, had access to a sex partner and didn't have sex for a week!  Pretty typical Warhol/Morrissey stuff: Self hatred, guilt, shame and money. How these people got tagged as the avant-garde is beyond me. Warhol and Morrissey were reactionaries through and through.   I gave it two stars because it is sort of 'interesting' if you've never known people like the characters. They're around. If you're watching the movie to look at Joe D'allesandro, I won't hold that against you. 
 The "Latin" moves in this workout seem strangely like American aerobics to me.  You can work up a sweat by adding a lot of intensity to the moves, but if you're interested in Latin dance, my advice is to buy Brazilian Dance Workout with Vanessa Isaac instead.  This workout just isn't as energetic and fast-paced as it looks 
 This is certainly the worst of it. At least Lil Jon has good beats and stuff. This has none of that, and it is just annoying. Support better artists 
 I give this book one star as there was nothing lower to choose from.  Save your money.  This book is not worth either your time or your money.  Was she on drugs during the writing of this piece of tripe?  
 As other reviewers have noted, this book is not exactly what you may be expecting.  Don't expect to see concrete suggestions on how to clear clutter, or perhaps ways of staying organized.  This book is really a strange new age religious book.  It will briefly touch upon reality, such as: junk in a corner will distract us when we walk into a room.  Yes, this makes sense.  Or perhaps that cleaning up clutter will improve your mood in your home.  This also makes sense.  However, then we enter "Crazy Karen" land.  Karen can smell the taint of clutter when she enters a house.  In fact, she can tell if your house is cluttered by smelling you.  Yes, outside of your home, she can sense the clutter.  That is how in-tune she is with the spirit world.  Instead of just cleaning up the clutter, you probably should get out some sacred candles, walk the mystic circle 4 times, and use a special clutter clearing chant to get rid of the negative vibes which will cause clutter to appear.  Over all, I don't think the chants are necessary to clean a house, nor that mystical spirits are causing me to drop my clothes in a pile near my closet.  It just happens.  In either case, if you believe her, or think she's a nutcase, I still think the book won't be all that inspiring.  It very rarely touches on concrete suggestions, and then moves onto the next topic without giving you a real answer.  It is a "feel good" book, but not one which should be relied upon to help you solve a problem 
 I bought this to upgrade my wireless connection to my Xbox 360. The Wireless connectivity was passable (not great) but what ultimately made me return this was after multiple tests I determined that the router had cut my connection speed to a third of its original speed. I tried to trouble-shoot w/ Linksys Tech Support to no avail 
 Norman Augustine and Kenneth Adelman hop on the Bard's very crowded coattails with this attempt to translate soliloquies into sales.  Give them points for timing.  1999's Shakespeare in Love garnered seven Oscars.  Now  that everyone thinks Shakespeare looked like Joseph Fiennes, Will is hotter  than ever. But do men in tights using words like "anon" and  "whilst" really have anything to teach middle management?   Perhaps.  Shakespeare's genius was his ability to plumb the human psyche,  dissect the motivations of his characters, and make even taking out the  garbage sound like poetry.  To the extent that business success is often  determined not by who makes the best widget, but who understands the  complexities of person-to-person relationships, the premise of this book is  on target.  Yet stuffing Hamlet and Henry IV into three-piece suits is a  stretch, to say the least. Each chapter is a quick study of a different  Shakespearian play; for instance, Julius Ceasar as a model of poor  succession planning within an organization, or The Merchant of Venice as a  lesson in risk management.  The parallels drawn between these plays and  modern case studies flow naturally and well.   The authors, however, cram  so many Shakespeare quotations into their little book, even in the opening  credits, it is very nearly swamped.  Many of these quotes are strained,  discombobulating, and downright annoying.  This reaches a laughable low  when a case study opens with Victoria's Secret's sales going flat:   "Leslie H. Wexner, the chairman of Intimate Brands, decided on a  strategy posed by Posthumus in Cymbeline, who says, 'I will begin the  fashion - less without and more within' and so changed the company by  offering the best bras on the market." Taking snippets of Shakespeare  out of context and hammering them sideways into a business case study does  not make them wise proverbs for the CEO, they remain poorly packaged  gimmicks for selling a book.  In the Historical Figures as Business Gurus  genre, read Donald T. Phillips' Lincoln on Leadership for truly useful  advice.  As for Shakespeare in Charge, you can get the same effect for much  less money by reading the Wall Street Journal while watching a video of  Hamlet 
 I was so excited to see another Noam Chomsky film, but terribly disappointed with this particular collection of snippets.  The editing was so distracting and disconnected that I stopped watching the piece.  There are silly cut aways just for "art's sake",  the cameras go in and out of focus and shift angles for no reason, and the order of the lecture bits didn't make any sense to me.  Chomsky's ideas are hard enough to follow if you don't have background info. on his subject, but it is fun and challenging to try to follow him as he explains the agendas behind our news, our reporting, our politicians, etc....  This film makes that kind of challenge almost impossible.  (at least for me) Chomsky is, in my opinion, a genius and this film did not convey his coherent thoughts and eloquent speeches.  I recommend Manufacturing Consent if you are new to Noam 
 God was a man. His name was Jesus Christ. Learn about Him if you want to Learn about God. True, he's not going to make you feel better about yourself without challenging you to change, as most new age philsophers will. But he'll bring you to God. No one else can. no one 
 Philip Roth is a taste I haven't acquired yet.  He is lauded by critics - including Harold Bloom, who just happens to be a friend of his - as perhaps the greatest living American writer.  Before this novel, I had only read Portnoy's Complaint, which I couldn't even finish; I found it hopelessly dated, pedantic, and repetitive.  I like Operation Shylock more than Portnoy's Complaint, I guess - although I can't say that I really ENJOYED either.  However, at least things happen in this novel.  The gimmick of the book is that it is a "confession" - a story of supposedly true events that happened to Philip Roth in 1988.  The story concerns the emergence of a "fake" Philip Roth who is traveling around Israel, promoting the cause of "Diasporism" - the relocation of Israel's Jews back to Europe.  The real Roth travels to Jerusalem to confront his impostor.    Having now read the book, it is difficult to tell whether or not the real Roth is for Diasporism.  There is a lot of anti-Zionist rhetoric in the book - much of which I found distasteful - but is that the "real" Roth or not?  Is he really anti-Zionist?  It's hard to say, because he frequently asserts how foolish Diasporism is: the European community would not welcome the Jews back with open arms.     Somewhere in one of Raymond Chandler's novels, Philip Marlowe mocks Hemmingway as a man who thinks saying the same thing over and over makes it profound.  Well, the same thing can be said of Philip Roth.  There are a lot of things about his style I don't like.  He is very pedantic: he always has an axe to grind, but instead, he grinds his readers into the ground.  He allows his characters to speak, sometimes for pages at a time, without so much as starting a new paragraph.  His most annoying trait however, is how in love with himself he is.  It's odd but true - if you keep saying how great you are, people will believe you.  Through his characters, he lavishes praise onto himself and his books.  Also, he's apparently catnip to the ladies.  Is this novel non-fiction?  Of course not.  Will I ever read another Philip Roth novel?  Probably - with so many critics telling me I'm wrong, I have to allow for that possibility.  I'm just not looking forward to the experience. 
 I've read many magazine articles on domino knitting, and have made pieces in the past. The small book clearly, in word and in diagrams, teaches how to use this technique. I finally understand *exactly* where to pick up stitches and I liked the way in which the projects referred back and forth to each other.  My low rating comes from the format of the book itself. The book is so small, and the cover is so stiff, it is very difficult to keep the book open to refer to while knitting. Also, entire sections of my book were misprinted--mostly blank pages, but then another section was printed slightly off center 
 Right from the beginning!!!!!!!Horvath  checks his buddys  house after he disappears and has to CHAMBER a round in his S&W. No trained operative or law enforcement officer carries a weapon with an empty chamber. He also, while checking out the property, describes several cars in the area. All of a sudden he alludes to a FORD. Never mentioned it before...where did the Ford come from....or did he mean the Navigator that he previously referred to as a Lincoln. And then.......the one that broke the camels back.....after being captured in Lawlors house and having his equipment evaluated...........no more S&W but now a Sig 40!!!!!!!!!!  Amateur writing!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Greg 35 year police vet 
 To me, John Gardner was egotistical, self-serving, and liked nothing better than the sound of his own voice.  Ms. Thornton was nothing but a doormat, and a doormat who should have known better.  Ms Thornton claims writing this book was therapeutic, brought closure, etc.  Frankly, I don't think the book served its' purpose.  She seems to be the same starry eyed person she was, when John Gardner first appeared on the horizon.  And there is no doubt, that Ms. Thornton would have continued on her path of self destruction had John Gardner lived 
 I bought this book before a family trip to the Grand Canyon. I thought I had looked around enough at different guide books but I was wrong. This book is fine if your Canyon trip is 100% hiking. Otherwise it is a bit thin and very dry. Not too helpful over all.  There must be something better.  
 I was enjoying this book for the first sixty-seventy pages until I read Mr. Lengel's description of Ft. Ticonderoga. He places the Fort on the Hudson River. (????) Ft. Ticonderoga, so important a location in the French/Indian and Revolutionary wars is, in fact, on Lake Champlain. Mr. Lengel also incorrectly writes that Henry Knox, after retrieving the cannons from Ft. Ticonderoga takes them down the Hudson. This too is incorrect. Knox and his men took the cannons across land to Lake George (which was frozen in winter), down to Lake George village and south to Albany before turning east to Boston. I'm totally shocked that no review of this book mentions these inaccurate statements. Anyway, after about 100 pages I took the book back to the library. I couldn't depend on the rest of his facts-so what's the point of reading it? 
 This work is difficult to read. There are enough exclamation points to exhaust most readers. A lack of humility and the self aggrandizement soon makes the reader quite weary. The subject matter is well woth exploring but the author gets in the way. I cannot recommend this book 
 I think that I am clearly insane, but I did not like this book. Everyone else in the world likes this book, but i am the insane person who does not. And I'm NOT sarcastic! I could barly read it a second time. I hated this book. 
 I am a Navy Wife of four years facing my first deployment as a wife and I found this book to be the corniest thing I've ever read. EVER.  The "comical" stories everyone seems to be gushing over sound like they were pulled right out of a dusty old Reader's Digest. I didn't find the book to be informative and I found the definition section of the book to be incredibly trite and boring.   Example: Term Active Duty, Military Speak: Actively serving and deployable. Spouse Speak: This means your address is written in pencil in address books.  Dear God. How incredibly lame. Military members move. Yes. It's true. We ALL know that. Civilians know this. EVERYONE knows this. This poor attempt at humor is dull and over-used.  I didn't learn ANYTHING from this book and would NOT recommend this to anyone  SERIOUSLY looking for information or advice about military life or deployments. You can get USEFUL information by going to your local Fleet and Family Support Center or attending a pre-deployment brief. 
 Unfortunately you shipped me a Region 1 version when I am clearly in UK, Region2. you then shipped a FOC replacement, again Region1 you then offered me a refund if I paid to ship them back to you, as I have not been able to view either copy and cannot give you a better "review"  
 I bought these books because of their amusing titles, but the storylines just don't deliver. I saw the ending of this book coming from a mile away. Still, it wasn't as cutesy and smirking as its predecessor, of which I'm  grateful. Read "If I Ever Return, Pretty Peggy-O" for a good  McCrumb novel 
 Babies and children cry for a reason, and is their first formof communication.  Ignoring their cries teaches them that they aren'timportant and no one is going to care for their needs.  Many desperate parents grab books like this, follow it, and have their hearts broken- in order to sleep. Babies arent' programmed to sleep through the night, something that Dr Ferber, a detached segment of our society and many non creative authors seem to have forgotten.  Read "Nighttime Parenting" by William and Martha Sears, and their book on SIDS for a good understanding of sleep in babies and children 
 We bought "the series."  What we got was Season 2 complete (unless any were originally 2 hours in length); the pilot tv movie McCLOUD: WHO KILLED MISS U.S.A.? bearing the syndication title PORTRAIT OF A DEAD GIRL; and three 90-minute "movies" each compiled subsequent to their original network run by frankensteining two random, unrelated one-hour episodes of the show's first season - which ran under the umbrella title, 4 IN 1 - and cutting each set of two episodes by 30 minutes -- with the result that some guest stars were entirely cut from the mix!  For those studio executives who don't understand the concept, nostalgia means we want what we remember viewing...the way it was...not frankensteined into phony movies.  If Universal had any integrity at all, they'd gather that pilot with its original title sequence and the unedited, original 1-hour network versions of these six episodes...with the 4 IN 1 umbrella sequence...and at least offer to sell this to us in a nice slimcase to replace their careless disc 1, season 1.  I supposed next we'll have to beware of COLUMBO and other MYSTERY MOVIE 2-hour episodes being released edited down to 90 minutes to conform (and yet being sold as "The Complete Season! 
 On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the illustrious Ms. Cornwell?  Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly.  However, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  For such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans throughout.  Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ."  Are you kidding me?  The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must WORK in one of the houses.  The author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy.  Read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.   DY 
 This work represents all that is wrong with certain elements of the liberal establishment.  Instead of acknowleding what's good in the Church, they insist on continuing their campaign of hatred against one of the remaining bastion of decency in this world...But again it is so fashionnable to be anti-catholic in certain groups nowadays.. 
 Not in a long time have i had such a dislike for a movie as i do with Freeway. I am a fan of dark comedies so i thought i might check this movie out, it has reese witherspoon after all, how bad could it be? Well, really bad. First of all on a good note, reese witherspoon is good enough in the movie, although her character isn't all that likeable nor do you empathize with her all that much. But Reese does a good job with what shes given.  My main beef with the movie is that i would not call it a dark comedy. It's more like a comedy that also wants to be dark, graphic and serious, or a dark graphic serious movie that wants to be funny. The result is that it's a movie that doesnt know what it is or what it's trying to do. Both the funny parts and the serious parts are horribly mixed together in a way that it feels like two different movies fighting for the screen.  But hey, if you find being shot in the neck, or stiff lifeless grandmas with their throats slit and a horrified expression on their face to be funny, you just might like this movie 
 The radio controlled "atomic" clock is not based on a mature technology.  Mis-communications could happen quite often.  The programmers did not build a robust program to check and eliminate these mis-communications (a very simple task).  As a result, the clock could display wrong time randomly under certain conditions, and therefore could cost the user big damage.  I have three atomic clocks.  They had displayed wrong time at least 20 times in the past year.  Sometimes this happens simultaneously to two clocks--they showed two different times and both of them were not correct.  Since there is no way to turn off the radio receiver, the clock simply cannot be trusted.  Using a regular clock, at least I know it is within a few seconds to the real time.  Using an atomic clock, I don't know anything about the correctness of the time it shows.  My atomic clocks were off 35, 65, 120, 60, etc. minutes many times (sometimes ahead, sometimes behind).  Today, it made me got up an hour earlier in the morning.  It showed 6:00am when I looked at it.  It was raining and was dark.  I got up and took a shower.  When I came out of the bathroom, I payed attention to a regular clock in my kitchen.  It showed 5:05am.  After I verified with the time showed on my watch, I realized that I was cheated by the atomic clock AGAIN.  What a wreck 
 The feeling the book gave me was one of disjointed-ness, I couldn't  fully submerge myself into the book because it didn't seem like the writer could decide how she wanted to present the material. It read like conjecture for a lot of it, with "could", "would have" , and it also read like a lecture given by a professor, at the same time, it was too conversational, and in all just poorly written. The material was interesting enough, and her conjectures intriguing, it was just the presentation that was faulty. It would also have been better if she could have given logic for her conjectures, as it is...she would have done better to have written the book as a fiction novel, and it would have carried better. 
 Do not buy this vacuum if you have a pet.  Cleaning out the canister is a very MESSY job and the dirt and pet hair stick all over the filter.  Replacement filters are difficult to find and must be ordered on-line.  I've put up with this vacuum for a year and I'm now buying a new BAGGED vacuum.  I've put up with it this long because it is very lightweight, it has a nice retractable handle, and you can set it to "suction only" and use it on bare floors.  But cleaning out the dirt and pet hair is messy, messy, messy 
 Loved the price but I never actually received the item.  It shipped to the wrong address and I never got it back :- 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 I hate the casualties(they are the definition of poser)and this cd really proves they suck the only thing good about this cd is they're not obsessed with PUNX OI OI OI PUNX,they need to give up alread 
 Expedited shipping was erroneously entered for this order. Tried to change and then cancel it minutes after entry and repeatedly until it came to no avail.  Refused package a month ago.  Exorbitant charge made to my credit card and I will have to seek resolution with them, since Amazon takes no responsibility.  Vendor has not responded to over 20 calls and emails to cancel/refund order.  AMAZON PLACES ORDERS WITH SKETCHY VENDORS LIKE THIS AND THEN YOU'RE STUCK WITH ERRONEOUS CHARGES.  BEWARE!! 
 This is a childrens book and it is supposed to teach a positive message. It should have been tiltled the "jewish Mother " tree or something. So the message was Use me and use me and use me some more and after I'm all used up, use me some more and I will be happy. Thats something we want to convey to children 
 i just finished reading the book.  there is nothing in it about velocity... It's boring, predictable and has lots of "filler text 
 When Fantasia came out in 1938, it bombed.  Many years later, the movie received the acclaim it deserved.  Fantasia has enchanted me since I was a child, and I eagerly awaited Fantasia 2000.  The possibilities!  I was sure Disney would come up with something to rival the original.  What I saw was a humorless, boring mish-mash with only a few bright spots.  The opening segment of whales flying through space was embarrassingly bad.  Silly flamingos also fell flat.  Donald Duck as Noah was terrific.  The Gershwin piece was ok, but not for Fantasia.  And what should have been the crowning achievement, a forest nymph battling to save her beloved forest, was predictable and stale.  This film was almost a complete waste of my time and money.  I heartily, heartily, endorse the orginal Fantasia as a timeless classic for all ages 
 This is the usual humanistic rosy misportrayal of organic evolution. As always, trivial changes within species or within genera are blindly extrapolated to molecules-to-man evolution. The numerous contradictory  opinions within human evolutionary scenarios are conveniently glossed over.  Creationism is rejected as science because it supposedly is simply a  belief. In truth, whether you agree with creationists or not, you must face  the fact that creationists rest their positions not just on religious  beliefs but also on the empirical evidence 
 Man! this movie is soooooo boring. I literally slept through this movie. If I die not having watched it again ill be happy.   i dont even know what its about cuz i watched it when i was like 5 yrs. old, but i dont care cuz just thinkin bout it makes me wanna cr 
 I wanted to like this book more than I did, but I just found a lot of it to be, like, lame! Savan has some good points but she repeats herself so much, drowning every sentence in 'pop words' that offset other 'pop words' reminding her of even more 'pop words', that large parts of the book are a convoluted mess! Much of the ground has been covered elsewhere, in greater detail, and in less headache-inducing style! I did find some interesting nuggets, but had to skim through a lot of tedious material to get there. Fans of language should check it out if they're curious. People who can do without socio-political commentary should skip it

 This book had perhaps a little too much hype to live up to and as a result I was slightly disappointed in the final result. Its well written but the writing stile is a little more accademic than other books in Appress's  "practical" series. Some of the code examples are lacking in commentary or explanation. 
 Now that Professor Chasteen's personal friends, ex-students, and professional connections have had their say, perhaps a dash of insight would be relevant. This is a lousy book, in part because the premise is ludicrous. There cannot be a concise history of Latin America for the same reason that there cannot be a concise rendering of Newton's Principia. Thus, what professor Chasteen has provided is a concise overview of his personal prejudices, the vast majority of which he directs against (and here's a surprise) the United States and Europe. That these prejudices are personal is evident from the dedication (in which he states that his Latin American children are improving the US simply by their presence) until the meandering, pointless fizzling out of his discussion 250 pages later. The history is mediocre, at best, and some of Chasteen's opinions are so ridiculous (anyone historian who singles out the Carter administration's foreign policies for admiration has been hitting the bong a little too hard) that you have to wonder why he continues to live in a country he so plainly abhors.  The writing is so saturated with neoliberal condescension that professor Chasteen's acknowledgement to the over 100 students who read the manuscript seems a wholly fitting exercise, given that they may well have written the dreadful thing 
 I bought this CD for a few bucks a while ago at a Christian music store. The next day I brought it back. I expected it to be different, but I didn't expect it to be horrible.  This is early '90s rap. We're talking really bad here. Like, Vanilla Ice/Ninja Rap-bad. They had to start somewhere, but if you want my advice, skip this and go to the good stuff - Supernatural, Jesus Freak, etc 
 Being a student of Mr. Walker, I had to read this book for his class, and failed the test on it.  I would have read it, but I couldn't keep my eyes open when I tried to.  I does have a couple of humerious stories, but most  are very boring.  TEACHERS: Please do not torture your students with this  book 
 This book was readable and somewhat compelling in that I wanted to know what would happen next.  However, the narrative was ridiculous in its depiction of the character's lives.  A UCLA professor who seems to have all kinds of free time for attending events with her famous movie star husband?  It reinforces the stereotype of college professors having an easy job that doesn't require any more time than giving lectures (with apparently no preparation), going on sabbatical whenever they feel like it, and traveling to exotic places to do research.  That was just one of the silly descriptions in this very silly book.  I had to work to suspend my disbelief long enough to finish it.  It was like watching a soap opera - a guilty pleasure 
 Used along with Shampoo Theory, my hair turned out worse than it ever had.  Not recommended, at least for medium/wavy hair.  No frizz control 
 Coming after the "Back to the Future" movie trilogy, with its perfectly placed conundrums and insanely ingenious plot twists, and after Stephen Fry's capricious "Making History," another good, fully thought-out  alternative history, this Gore Vidal opus rather pales in comparison.   Vidal tackles Big Physics, but gets immediately lazy and is unable and/or  unwilling to flesh out the math and the scientific concepts.  So we're left  with a hodge-podge of famous characters, past presidents mostly, who behave  arbitrarily and a plot that turns arbitrarily.  What's the point?  I don't  know - "life's a silly game" maybe?  This could have been an excellent book  to give to your teenage son (if for no other reason than that it shows a  kid doing something other than staring dumbly at his computer) but the  graphic sex is probably something most parents wouldn't feel comfortable  passing on to their "impressionable" offspring 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 If you work for a large corporation which has millions of $ to spend on DW projects, maybe you should look at this book and even consider some of the ideas that it contains. But if you need to develop a data warehouse using limited resources and within a certain timeframe, your time will better used reading other books, because following the Inmon approach will lead you to an unnecessary complicated and expensive design. I found that the arguments used by Inmon to demonstrate the limits of the dimensional approach are not convincing at all. For example, at page 142 he says "Because there is a different data structure for each data mart, making any data mart into a data warehouse doesn't make sense." Having personally implemented several data warehouses using the "conformed dimensions" approach, I can guarantee that it worked and produced a very elegant and clean data model. 
 I had to read this book for an anthropology class taught by an intelligent but uberfeminist professor.  There's an important point in this book that sheds light on its angle: when a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and full coverings was asked how she can walk around in the heat dressed in such a manner she responds something to the effect of "it's not as hot as the fires of hell."  Mernissi is not about to challenge behaviors that are dictated by Islamic scriptures.  Her argument is that the veil and woman's place in the Muslim society are a result of misinterpretation of the scriptures and the hadith.  This is sort of akin to Christians trying to reinterpret creation as an instructive myth after Darwin shattered the fundamentalist vision of creation.  I think Mernissi's approach is generally doomed because, if tradition has failed to maintain the original spirit of a religion, a new analysis almost 1500 years after the fact is almost certainly doomed.  There are too many epistemological problems with diving the original intentions behind a text that is so old.  Mernissi may convince some readers that her radically new interpretation is correct but only at the cost of introducing uncertainty and mistrust in the traditions themselves. Fatally wounding relgious traditions is nearly a fatal wound to the religion itself, and will only cause apathy or fundamentalist overreaction to a challenge of the status quo 
 The Public Relations Kit For Dummies by Eric Yaverbaum and Bob Bly should be called The Public Relations Kit For Blooming Idiots. I cannot think of one thing I learnt from this book. If you have a basic ideal of how to create a press release and grammar skills above a forth grade level you do not need this book. Here are a few items the authors did not cover in this book:  1. How to organize a press kit for any occupation such as an actor/actress, an author, ........... There should be AT LEAST A BARE BONES BASICS OF AN ORGANIZED PRESS KIT IN THIS BOOK, OR ON THE WORTHLESS CD AND THERE IS NOT.  2. There is VERY LITTLE INTERNET RESOURCES IN THIS BOOK. Shame on you two for that!  Save your $20.00. There is NOTHING in this book you cannot find on the internet in one evening of research. 
 Antidotal stories, personal opinions, and somewhat painful to listen too.  It was a great premise, but the delivery isn't very good.  I wish I had saved my money and not purchased this boo 
 If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy 
 This book was not funny at all.  I consider myself an open person.  If a mother wants to breastfeed, then she should breastfeed.  If she prefers formula, then use formula.  There can even be a happy medium (I used both).  This book made breastfeeding mothers sound like selfish, nosey, busybodies who have nothing better to do than dish out unwanted advice.  It implied that mothers who chose to use formula were victims.  I found the material and language to be offensive and insulting. 
 I bought this book, hoping that it might offer me some intelligent and persuasive help, but was dismayed by its banal psycho-babble.  It may be a helpful book for someone who is new to therapy or who is not struggling with agonizing circumstances, but not for the self-reflective or truly pained 
 I was happy at the appearance of the bag, but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack.  I received it around Christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell.  It still smells making it unable to use 
 Jack "Deuce" Cooper (Matt LeBlanc) is a minor league baseball pitcher who's got the goods, but no self-confidence. Instead of looking up Dr. Phil, the team manager decides that a simian teammate is just what strike-out Deuce needs for a boost. Enter Ed, a chimp who's got more talent in his elongated little finger than the whole team put together. Ed's antics, including scarfing down chocolate-covered bananas and pulling toupees off of bald heads, were all "aped" by men in monkey suits and animatronics. Unfunny slapstick makes this DVD a real strike-out.  Staci Layne Wilson Author of Staci's Guide to Animal Movie 
 I regret buying this book. It's not a guide for young people to starting your own business unless you call part time babysitting a business or selling your goods at a flea market as having your own business. The "businesses" the author has in mind are are, for example, selling homemade goods to your friends or anyone else you can get to buy them. If you call having a lemonade stand  a business, then this book may pertain to you 
 What dooms "A Son Called Gabriel" is a combination or too much ambiguity at the end and too little focus throughout.  By the unsatisfying end, I never felt any connection to the book or to the relatively flat characters.  It might just be that I've read far better books on the subject of a young man grappling with his sexual identity.  I agree with another reviewer who remarked this entire book could have been condensed into a Part I with a Part II and possibly Part III that get to the meatier times in Gabriel's life after he leaves for college.  That Gabriel plays with girls and dolls and wants to be a hairdresser at 7-9 is interesting--albeit stereotypical--but doesn't warrant 100 pages of development.  The early teen years also don't add a lot.  Really nothing gets moving in this story until Gabriel's 16-18 or so and by then it was almost over.  There's a lot of lip service given to the Catholic-Protestant "Troubles" in the 60s, 70s, but it's never clear how any of this really affects Gabriel's development.  Since he's boyfriend to a Protestant girl, I'd have to say the political tensions didn't matter a whole lot to him.  In which case, it doesn't add much to the story.  At the end of course there's the big Scarlet Letter/Empire Strikes Back twist, which only distracts readers from the fact that the ending raises more questions than it answers.  What will happen to Gabriel in London?  Will he and Fiona stay together?  Was Father Brendan a homosexual?  We'll never know unless there's a sequel in the works.  As for the writing, it was average.  I thought the author was guilty of run-on sentences at a few points, but that's just me.  There wasn't enough scene-setting.  Instead, we get a lot of rushing through test preparations/results and repetitive encounters with school bullies.  As a result of all the rushing around, there wasn't time to really develop the characters.  The rest of Gabriel's family isn't much different than any sitcom family because there wasn't time to really settle in and flesh out their personalities into more than one dimension.  But as I said at the beginning, my lack of enthusiasm might be because I've read better books on the subject.  "A Home at the End of the World" by Michael Cunningham, "Kavalier and Clay" by Michael Chabon, and "Line of Beauty" by Alan Hollinghurst top that list, the latter two winning the Pulitzer and Booker Prize respectively.  By comparison, "A Son Called Gabriel" isn't in the same weight class 
 I like a few other readers was excited to start this book after reading so many great reviews... what were they all thinking?? This book was so boring and the back and forth between then and now was painstakingly slow. The main character was so unlikable, as a child and as an adult. Her fascination with her brother Matt, was not fully explained, and really all the characters could have been written better. The layout of the book I also felt was badly edited. I literally had to force myself to finish it because I figured I'd already spent so much of my time I figured I had to know the end. What a let down.... I found it way to corny and anti-climatic. Seriously, if you're on the fence about this one, keep on searching. Leave this book alone, you'll be doing yourself a favor 
 I got these chairs in july 2006 and was very pleased how they look. After eight months front right legs on both chairs cracked and broke.We are not overweight people (140-190lb). Very sad that we have to replace them, because we were happy with appearance 
 I had to force myself to finish this book. After reading two-thirds I felt compelled to finish it simply in hopes of finding some redeeming value to the time I'd already invested.  Upon finishing the book (unlike the insightful and eloquent analysis by the Reader in New England) I shut the book and said, "This is the stupidest book I have ever read!"  After calming down a little I began to wonder if perhaps Wise Blood represented Flannery's life and emotions?  One has to imagine being stricken with a debilitating disease that eventually robbed her of life at a young age must have tortured her to some degree.  She must have wondered where is God in all this without being able to deny Him.  Could Hazel represent Flannery? A life of seeming despair, allowed to waist away slowly in a drainage ditch only to be finally found yet treated with complete disregard and with utter contempt by the police sent to rescue and redeem Haze (Flannery) by thumping him (her) on the head with a death blow without any apparent feelings.  Was Flannery making a statement about being treated thus by God?  Is it possible Flannery used Wise Blood as a cathartic for her own emotions towards God for the cards she'd been dealt?  I don't say that judgmentally in the least.  It just makes sense now that I am calm enough to think about it. I'm hardly qualified to dish out such psycho-babble.  Basically, I still agree with the New England reader in terms of regretting the read.  Perhaps this story will have more meaning should I face personal suffering and loss like Flannery.  Faith does not make one immune to the multi-levels of agony.  This story was agonizing 
 Vasari's classic text is well written (translated, I guess I should say) but extremely tiresome.  For nearly every artist he simply lists their works, and rarely with more analysis than by describing them as "life-like" or "beautiful."  For example, here is what he says about Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, one of his most famous and celebrated paintings: "He did a panel for the main altar containing Our Lady ascending into heaven, with the twelve apostles standing below her and watching her ascent, but since this work was painted on canvas and perhaps poorly cared for, little of it can be seen."  That's it.  The only exception to his utter factual tediousness is Michelangelo's Life, where, although he goes into almost no description of the works themselves besides his characteristic fulsomeness, he does provide some interesting anecdotes.  If you are looking to understand and analyze Renaissance art than this book will not help you.  If you are looking to engage in scholarly debate over the origins and documentations of the discussed works then you should probably read the original, unedited version in Italian anyway. 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 This book was assigned to me in my Criminal Justice class. It is very easily readable but FULL of mis-represented statistics and mis-quoted quotes.   This book has a major tone of shame directed at white americans. Mr. Johnson even attacks the American capitolist system, insenuating that it is a racist system.   This book is biased and very opinionated but the authors writing style mimics that of facts and statistics.   NOT recommended, especially for easily impressionable. I am very disapointed that this book is being used "unbiased, true, and factual" education tool. 
 Thay is a wonderful Dharma teacher, of course, but he reads classical texts through his own philosophy and tries to hide any reference to our self nature, the very key of Zen.  In his commentary on _The Diamond That Cuts Through Illusion Sutra_, he is limited by his own approach. You can better read Ven. Master Hanshan's commentary, what a difference! This is not a Thay's worthy work. He can do it much better, only if he forgets his own philosophy for a second 
 Some reviews have suggested that this is not the ideal first purchase for the un-inititiated.  I am writing to confirm that assertion.  I have read enough raving reviews about their subsequent releases to know that it really does get better from here, but what a disappointment this album was for me.  It sounds like what you would hear coming from the garage next door.  My advice to the kids would be to keep practing and please turn it down.  Jack's appreciation of the blues is admirable, but only realised on the song "I Fought Piranhas".  Tellingly, this is the final song on the album.  Otherwise the songs are forgettable and even annoying at times. 
 This book was just a major disappointment. The subject is superb, perhaps the true golden age of baseball, but Roger Kahn ruined it with his windy political opinons. Mr. Kahn seems almost confrontational with his political views, and seems unable to present any baseball history without them. I finally stopped reading it about a fifth of the way through and am very sorry I bought it. Read "Dynasty" and "Bums" by Peter Golenbock for real history. Don't waste your money on this stinker 
 Just for those of you out there who don't know, Al Bielek has successfully been proven a fraud by a group of researchers.  These are not your typical skeptics, they all still believe that the Phila Experiment happened, but that Bielek was in no way involved with the whole thing.    http://www.bielek-debunked.com It convicned me.   People like Commander X and Bielek are taking you for a ride folks, and they're laughing all the way to the bank.  I'm not saying there aren't conspiracies, and no, i wasn't sent here by the "New World Order," I'm just trying to tell you people to not believe everything you hear to be fact.  This is just science fiction 
 I bought this book out of curiosity about the "movers and shakers" of the real estate industry. I know there have been obscene amounts of money made there, and I was interested in getting an insider's look, as I know Tom Wolfe spent a significant amount of time with some real estate industry magnates. However, as a novel, the book doesn't really work - it's hard to sustain any interest in or sympathy for the main characters as they fall further and further into untenable situations caused by their own greed and lack of self-awareness. Frankly, I couldn't even finish it 
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be.  They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body.  Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first.  A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects.  Some don't make it out the other side.  I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone.  Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones.  I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too.  Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 This book has an attractive cover.  It has a mildly interesting introduction.  But that's it.  The balance of the book reads as if the author, with oh, perhaps five days to produce this work rounded up a bunch of fans, let them babble about what Bruce's music has meant to them, asked someone to transcribe the narratives, added a few uninsightful comments, and called it a book.  How sad.  How lazy.  The book adds virtually nothing to the studies of this legendary artist.  I bemoan the Bruce fans who received this book as a holiday gift from well-intentioned relatives.  I weep for the trees that were sacrificed to produce it.  And the real tragedy -- and irony -- is that apiring artists (as Bruce once was) find it nearly impossible to attract notice in significant measure because publishers would rather bank on authors such as Coles who have outstanding academic credentials and a publishing "track record," even if the egotistical trash they now produce wouldn't pass muster in any decent college English class.  If you already own this book, I suggest sending it back to Coles, annotated with a big red "F -- try again."   And if you don't already own it, take the money you considered using to buy this book and give it to a local food bank.  And if you're Robert Coles, you ought to be ashamed of yourself 
 A little outdated, quite a few beers here aren't made anymore. Beer reviews are always personal opinion, and you'll read a bunch of people complain in these reviews that this guy doesn't know what hes talking about. I'd ignore what they say, everybody has their own preference. Think about this before you buy this book: 1) Why do you need to hear what somebody else things of beers? 2) its very out dated... 5 years is a long time 
 After reading "Men Who Can't Love" (which, by the way, is brilliant!), I was excited to pick up another piece by these authors.  Unfortunately I was more than disappointed.  I should have seen a red flag when I saw the title, so I have no one to blame but myself.  Any woman who decides to "like herself" just so that a man can like her is sadly mistaken (you like yourself for yourself, not anybody else!).  Generalizations such as "a balding man is a better catch than a hottie" are... simply put, ignorant.  Theory that a lengthy first phone conversation indicates problems in the relationship going forward is ridiculous.  Half way through the book, I came to conclusion that it was written for teenagers - a couple of valid points surrounded by a whole lot of common sense rambling.  Women who want to improve their self-esteem should look elsewhere.  And finally, who in the world thinks about babies on the first date?? 
 Pinsky has alighted on the translation solution that will eventually give rise to the definitive English Dante.  Rather than forgo ryme altogether or force his English into perfect terza-rima, Pinsky employs slant rhyme.  Pinsky calls his version Yeatsean, but of course other poets have embraced slant rhyme to great effect--Dickinson stands out for me.    But reading Pinsky's "Translator's Note" prepares you for the failings of his translation.  For he has also aimed for a more compressed version, one with more enjambment, to convey something of Dante's own compression and, I suppose, swiftness.  The problem arises in the very first tercet, where Dante spends three full lines on waking up lost in that dark wood.  Pinsky dispenses with those lines in 18 syllables, then interrupts Dante's startling recollection at the end of the second line to rush the next tercet into the first one.  The enjambent conceals the slant rhyme, mooting Pinsky's otherwise brilliant poetic solution, and also shucks the essential weight of Dante's opening.  It reads like a prose translation, embarrased by even its own of-rhymes (which are actually a great idea!) and blasting through Dante's thought without recognizing Dante's own choices about end-stopping his thoughts more frequently.  Unless English is 20 percent more efficient than Italian, or translators care for sense at the exclusion of the original's poetics, this book disappoints.    And it's a swift, compressed opening even at three full lines.  Three lines--just three--for Dante to depict himself as spiritually waylaid:  further compression simply detracts, and it dishonors the poem's already admirable economy, not just its efficiency but also how it chooses to spend each tercet, the careful filing of each one with this step or that in his journey, or to run over into the next tercet.    Pinsky's is a bilingual translation, allowing you to just visually register how much more ready he is than Dante to break Dante's thoughts before the end of a line and start Dante's next phrase or sentence with two or three or four syllables left.  All that enjambment is perfectly natural to English poetry, maybe even to Italian, but the facing-page presentation of Dante's actual words reveal that Dante employed rhyme togeth with the regular ryhthm of the line-endings to generally honor his rhetoric.    That compression, by the way, makes most of the cantos radically shorter than Dante's own verse.  Canto after canto is 20 to 30 lines short of Dante's Italian, and when a Canto is maybe 120 or 130 lines long, the translation becomes more like a discount version of Dante than an English Dante.  Allen Mandelbaum, who translates into blank verse (unrhymed iambic pentameter), offers the poem the dignity Dante's Italian merits.  You can use the facing page Italian to see that.  Dope out what those latinate words obviously mean, and see how much reordering and reduction Pinsky offers--here turning a descriptive phrase into a single adjective, there shrinking a long appositive or subordinate clause.  Pinsky's diction is more fluent, more readily grasped than other translations, but it often feels off-hand, hasty, artless, undramatic--a tour of Hell in cargo pants.  The story still conveys its tone, but mostly through incident, not via Pinsky's poetry 
 Most of this is common sense. Better off with a "starting a small  business" book. Gives good ideas for different specialties for errand  services 
 Maybe at the time it was written I would have reviewed it more favorably. In light of the life Miller led I can't help but to be disappointed by the cheap commericialization of the socialist superiority over capitalist theme that permeates the play. Here Miller creates a character only to destroy that character to point out the ills of capitalism, then Miller spends the rest of his life living an indulgent capitalist life here in the good ole USA: the very capitalist society that was supposedly Willy's oppressor. I think the years have taken the shine off of Miller a bit. I'm sure the Liberal 101 literature professor will disagree 
 1. Watch the movie "Hustle & Flow." The handful of songs that are played all the way through sound good, especially the catchy and smooth "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp" and "Hustle and Flow."  2. Get CD soundtrack to film. Discover to unpleasant surprise that virtually all of the songs on it are operating on the mental level of "Whoop That Trick." (That is to say, a very low IQ level, with endlessly repetitive choruses that aren't catchy.)  3. Realize that amongst the professional rappers on the soundtrack, the best one is professional actor Terrence Howard.  4. Smile bemusedly. Sell used CD 
 This book is almost useless for helping someone understand how to use acupressure to alleviate physical symptoms. As a licensed massage therapist who already knows quite a bit about acupressure, I am always willing to learn  more about any kind of bodywork. I had hoped to be able to pass on some ideas to my clients for self help but this book was definitely not it. The book gives some accupoints for specific problems, some of these are "golden points" able to stand alone in use, but others are not. The book gives no order to use these in and furthermore does not specify if all or any of the points are to be used together in sequence, or not. Also,it does't tell where the points are EXACTLY. There are really too many flaws to go into here. Acupressure is very complex, this book tries to simplify it to the point that it looks like some goofy folklore advocating some bad mojo 
 I feel compelled to speak out against David Irving. I was exposed to far right wing points of view in my youth in Durban South Africa and have heard many of his arguments before. The legality of Nuremburg is questioned and  the subsequent fate of world history is blamed on a mysterious cabal of  media bosses in America. To imply that Germany in the 1930's was not an  aggressive expansionist nation is ridiculous. It was not Churchill's  instigation that pushed Hitler into Poland in 1939. Prior to this the West  had made every effort to appease Hitler. Even a superficial reading of Mein  Kampf demonstrates that Hitler intended to expand eastward at the expense  of what he claimed to be sub-human people. True Churchill was no saint ,  his faults are well known. However he epitomised the spirit of the  Anglo-Saxon world during the dark days of 1940. Great Britain and her  Empire stood up to a system in which human rights and respect were trampled  upon with impunity. Hitler not Stalin unleashed the total war on the  Eastern front and ensured that it became the worst conflict known to  humanity and cost the lives of millions. We  had no choice in 1940 but to  resist this. Even if the course of post war history has been disapointing,  and I for one do not subscribe to this point of view, the sacrifice was  worth it. David Irving is a NAZI apologis 
 This is the kind of art that show me the power of fiction over reality. Why did he use those sizes? Wow! Did you see them? I do have fantasies but come on! Let's get real. Real guys with real dimensions. No more no less,  that's the beauty of life 
 I'm always amazed about people who study the Bible in order to find there errors. They have a lot to say, but it is vanity of vanities. If somebody cares about this topic, try to find "Forever Settled" by Jack Moorman. ISBN 1888328061 
 I own several desert landscaping and gardening books and this book is by far the best of the bunch.  It is organized according to species alphabetically, which makes it easy to look up plants.  It is comprehensive...I have never failed to find the specific plant, bush or tree I am researching.  Plus, full color photographs of each plant make it easy to pick and choose for visual effect 
 In WPF, Plantinga tries to provide an account of warrant that is superior to rivals such as Goldman's process reliabilism.  The work suffers from the following defects.  First, he is too quick in dismissing rival accounts.  Second, his arguments against evolutionary-naturalism will only convince those who already think that evolutionary naturalism is false.  Third, while he is quick to dismiss rival views, his own positive answers to philosophical problems are entirely unsatisfactory.  Consider his 'solution' to the Benacerraf problem.  It seems that mathematical statements refer to abstract objects.  It also seems that there must be a causal connection between our belief forming processes and the objects of belief if those beliefs are to be thought of as viable candidates for knowledge.  Plantinga says that this is not a problem for the theist who is willing to say that mathematical principles are structures of the divine mind since surely the connection between God and God's subjects is not problematic.  How one could think that Benacerraf's problem is a genuine one and that this is an adequate solution is beyond me.  While his WCD is to be recommended to those wanting an introduction to epistemology, this book is of limited merit 
 This offensively simple-minded pamphlet of useless advice is only given out by managers about to lay-off as many people as they can.   Then, to take away from horrors of losing your job, you're meant to feel happy because "change is good".   Not only that... you're meant to believe that questioning change is for losers -- as if change just comes magically from above, and not as a result of corporate incompetence and greed at the highest levels.    If your boss gives you this book (or worse, makes you buy it yourself), I recommend getting "who cut the cheese" by Mason Brown, instead.  And also, remember to steal as many office supplies as you can 
 This is the all-time WORST movie I've ever seen! I can't  believe how stupid it was! How some people think this is great film is WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY beyond me! It's a total snore-fest!  Plus it had way too much sexual humor!  Don't waste your time on this awful movie! 
 This book is not recommended for the average reader who just seeks information about borderline personality disorder. In fact, it is loaded with abstract erudition, it is hard to read, the information is often redundant,and it takes on a feminist approach in explaining the pathology. 
 The would is nice and it seems not to stress when full. other then that not much good to report. I should take about a half hour to build but because the directions are so bad that it will take you hours. There a step that you set the center beam and it gives you what holes to use for cds and dvd then it says adjust for vhs 9 inch boxes and other height but this is one of the first steps its like ask you to fit your set in a car when you only have the 4 wheels on. They could not spend anther few cents to put magnets on door so they do not open by themselves . You will have to go buy them yourself.  this could be nice if they spent a little bit more time on this.  get some bookends and magnets will help a lot. because of how its made the magnets have to line up with the outer frame of the door not near the lock end. this need work. if your paying over $230 your paying to much   
 The product itself is a superior concept, design and execution.  On the last page there is a lit house for which the swich was BROKEN, INOPERATIVE ON ARRIVAL. (I dont mean the security swich in the outside of  the  cover. Imr 
 The book is obviously well-researched and the chapter on The Riders was interesting.  However, the author included a lot of details that just really didn't matter-as if he threw in the entire contents of his research rather than sifting out the relevant facts.  The photos and illustrations that he used were illuminating and contributed to the educational value of the book. My professor was able to bring Dr. Schrag to talk to our class.  He was a good lecturer-keeping the class' interest with humor and introducing us to new ways to look at photography and the Metro.  If he could make his writing style more like his teaching style, I think he would have much more success as an author 
 Any blurb that begins: "We think of Europe as the charming continent of windmills and gondolas..." signals a book that doesn't set its sights too high up the evolutionary tree. It's like saying "We think of America as the charming continent of cowboys and obesity". It's treating the reader like a five-year-old.  Yes, Europe has problems. But it doesn't hold the copyright on riots, minorities that can't be assimilated or no-go zones in ethnic ghettoes. If more citizens of your wonderful country actually shifted their butts out of their air-con SUVs, got passports and came to visit Europe, you wouldn't need silly, patronising books like this. And, yes, we've got windmills and gondolas, if that's what makes you happy. 
 This is not a book and I have no idea what a "sourcing fee" is.  Save your money and don't buy this item 
 As someone who was named "The Bay Area's Best Career Coach" by the San Francisco Bay Guardian, I am in a position to assess the wisdom of the advice recommended in this book. Of course, the author can point to examples of people who succeeded despite not having goals or a plan, but they are the exceptions. To urge goal-free living is no wiser than urging that people take up cigarette smoking because some people don't get cancer. 
 I understand why it works because I am very familiar with other low carb diets and I understand the insulin and all the other stuff, but what confuses me big time is the thing about zone blocks and measurements. That totally throws it all off for me. If I could only understand it. It sounds like a great diet and I'm sure it is, but it's too complicated to understand for most people.. 
 Like the original "Turbulence," this one was a low budget version of the first.  Unlike the first one, this flick has half the passengers aboard a stricken 747 as terrorist and the other as "fear of flying" passengers to overcome the fear of flying.  There's a madman, the plane is in trouble, and a passenger must save the plane on return to Seattle.  The low budget effect shows on the airplane's cockpit and the plane on the runway  shows the passengers evacuating from a Boeing 737, and similar scenes from the original "Turbulence."  This flick is grounded 
 The day we received the stroller we were very excited. We put the stroller together which was very simple per instruction.  However, when we took the stroller out of the entryway of our house the elbow of the stroller where the stroller folds caught the underarm of the babies skin and pinched it into the elbow. Of course it tore the skin and the baby was screaming. We have not used the stroller again and we are still trying to resolve this issue with the company.  I would not reccommend this double jogger to anyone at this time 
 I had to read this over the summer for school, and I really hated this book. Part of the reason is that I couldn't relate to Selina, and the book was overly descriptive. I'll also agree with the person who said "What ending?" This book might be interesting if you're Caribbean or even African American. For a white Jewish girl living in the suburbs, it's not. 
 The remix is totally devoid of any taste:First the vocals are completely-off;the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings. Secondly,there is absolutely no respect on part of the "mixing DJs" for the great vocalists:there  is no melody and absolutely no 'jelling-together' of the music with the vocals. I was deeply disappointed with this cd.If you are into remixes get The Rod Stewart "Do ya think i am sexy" single cd instead 
 In its time, Rand's vision was intoxicating.  We are now living in a reality where big business pretty much influences everything in our lives, and the society that it has produced isn't exactly what Rand envisioned.  The idea of an unrestrained capitalism sounds wonderful as a philosophy.  But in truth, it's just as dangerous as total government control: Exxon Mobil, Walmart, etc. are not businesses, but institutions with power over our every day lives.  I don't think that this is the world that Rand intended, but it's the outcome of her philosophy.  Her efforts, while noble, have proven to be a failure.  
 Yes there are neat pictures in this book and loads of mathematica code. But that's it: no attempt is made to educate the reader: no list of important graphics programming paradigms, general strategies, etc. This book fails dramatically to meet the high standard set by the marvelous "mathematica book".  The many bugs and common work-arounds of the mathematica graphics system are not discussed at all. I would have wished a chapter about what is NOT possible with mathematica - such a chapter would have saved me a lot of time wasted in searching.  If you really want to do graphics programming, forget about this book and check the excellent mathematica usegroup instead

 When I order this book, I thought I will get lots of ready-to-use "Goals" which I can esay to set my subordinate's Goals. But I am very disappoint. Lots of Goals listing in the books are actually the working items not goals. Like "Deposit completed backups...", "Schedule all planned shutdown...". Therefore this book help me to setup the work items of my subordinate not set the goals.  Sa 
 I wore these socks once to a wedding; they had a "run" in them within a couple of hours. Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding, involving a longish walk on a dirt road, but it's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush (I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up). Bummer the socks got ruined so fast; they were really pretty :-( 
 How do you expect someone to purchase this item if they don't know its dimensions....please get with the program!! 
 This is a bubble gum type of book that does not teach anything about making money on the markets. It is a platform to sell Investor Business Daily services. If you want to learn trading look for articles written by Toby Crabel or Arthur Merrill, even Linda Raschke. They are full time professional money managers that happend to write few articles... some of them you can probably find on Ebay for cheaper... 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 I'm a 21 year old summer nanny to 3 kids under 10 and I have toddler-age cousins who I watch as well, and I am really disgusted with some of the song choices for these cds.  I realize kids are going to talk about many subjects that would have been taboo when I was little, and they are exposed to a great deal through the various media forms, but I wouldn't let my kids listen to my Maroon 5 cd.  Seriously, isn't it borderline pedaphillic to make "My pressure on your hips, sinkin' my fingertips into every inch of you, cause I know that's what you want me to do.." children's lyrics, DIRECTLY marketed at the toddler to tween age bracket? What's next, "Let's Get Drunk" by Jimmy Buffett? I can hear it now, angelic children's voices singing, "Barmaid, bring a pitcher, another round of brew, Honey, why don't we get drunk and screw"  Seriously people, stop buying these cds.  There are a lot of things your kids like and like to do but that doesn't mean they're in their best interest. I give this negative stars, black holes 
 I've gotten into bread baking and many of the books recommend measuring ingredients by weight instead of volume so I bought this scale.  It's very affordable and made by what I considered to be a good manufacturer.  I didn't think, though, that I would meet a scale that is so temperamental and indecisive.  I always place the scale on a level, flat surface but when I put something on it to be weighed, the readout fluctuates anywhere from tenths of an ounce to an ounce or two, going up or down and not really settling anywhere.  I have to wait a minute for the scale to make up its mind about EXACTLY how much the object weighs.    I probably should have gone to a brick-and-mortar store to check out the actual design of the scale before I placed my order.  Instead of individual on/off and tare buttons, this scale has "on", "off", and "tare" marked on the front edge of the scale and you are supposed to press down on your function of choice and the edge kind of buckles down and activates hidden buttons inside the mechanism:  Bear with me here, this is weird and hard to describe!  And it doesn't work very well either.  Sometimes, pushing down on "tare" turns the scale off.  I don't know why they didn't opt for simple straightforward buttons for the functions, but there you go.    The button that switches the scale between pounds/ounces to metric is on the bottom of the scale.  While it doesn't particularly bother me, one time, I did want to weigh something in one system and switch to another (too lazy to bust out the old conversion formula) and I had to remove the item, turn the scale over, flip the switch, and start the weighing process again.  I think I should have returned this and bought another model that would have made me happier.  This was a lesson in buying gadgets without physically checking them out--this scale looks good on paper and has a very affordable price tag, but it's not the best digital scale out there.  More than half the time, I don't feel like dealing with this wishy washy scale so I just measure out my ingredients by volume.  Which, indeed, defeats the purpose of why I got this scale in the first place 
 Having read a few Bosch books already (The Closers and Lost Light), I realized that I should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how Bosch became the Bosch I was reading in the later series.  However, I was very disappointed with this book.  One of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such).  I found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before I stopped reading)!  I thought it was ironic that Connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book.  Also, I found the book to be too gritty.  It lacked the emotion and soul that I found in the later books.  It seemed that Connelly was trying too hard to make Bosch fit this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that I read.  So it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because I just finished reading The Narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some other Bosch books and just read it out of order.  Connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better, which should explain why I didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it.  I gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe I was too impatient.  This is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order 
 The majority of the times I go into these films with no intention whatsoever.  I'm not a gorehound, but I'm willing to give mindless horror films a chance; it just so happens that more often so than not they fail horribly, this is just another example, one more title to put among the "Reasons modern horror does nothing for me."  I GUESS I can appreciate the attempt to keep it to true to life as possible, but it just got SO redudant so fast, HEY LOOK MANJUNK, MORE MANJUNK HOW SHOCKING AND OUT OF THE ORDINARY, OH NO HE'S CUTTING OFF HIS JOHNSON, OOO, GROSS, that I had to fight from slamming my head against the wall.  The acting, what little there was, was truly terrible.    I guess with the vast majority of the film being a, more or less, "silent" film, in the sense that Dr. Caligari is silent, but with accompanying music, they were trying to create SOME sort of atmosphere, added with the dusty rooms and the unshaved bodies of the lead roles, but again, it failed totally.  The gore wasn't impressive, human beings do not bleed bright red, I thought we learned this in the 70's.  I mean, I love the Italian horror films that are soaked in bright red blood, but when trying to present a serious, realistic film do not go in that direction.  The golden age of German film making is dead, gone, it's only survivor being Werner Herzog, just as the Russian film making scene is empty, and I can see why with schlock like this being shoved out of it's bowels that no one in their right mind cares anymore about anything that leaves it's immediate borders 
 Unfortunately there are not much words to loose. Poor writing together with the fact that practically all facts were lifted from Cameron's 'Conversation with Wilder' which is highly recommended btw, make this book forgettable. Why going through the whole exercise of publishing it is quite a mystery 
 1 star is for the DVD, 5 stars for the movie.  I don't need to say anything about the film; those familiar with Bava's work know this is among his masterpieces.  I'm writing this review to clear up some things about this new "Unslashed" edition.  On the positive side, this version is Anamorphic widescreen and it does present noticeably more picture information on the right and left sides of the frame (the old VCI version was leterboxed a 1.66:1, where as this one is 16 x 9). Now the bad news.  The color and contrast have been boosted/altered to the point that the image appears blurrier, grainier and more damaged than the previous version.  Also, the interior sets (especially in the fashion house) have a putrid yellow/green hue to them not present in the old version.  The soundtrack is horribly remixed, making the dialogue sound like it was recorded in a tin can and it pops quite a bit through the opening of the film.  The French and Italian audio channels are reversed.  None of these audio problems are present on the old version by the way.  To top it off, the dvd menus are gaudy and offputting, trying to make this seem like a bloody slasher pic.  In summution, the extra picture information just doesn't outweigh all of the drawbacks of this edition.  My advice is to hold on to your old release until something better comes along.  Thanks for reading.  -JWH 
 I have already put my comments into Blad's blog. The book, though well written, is too shallow. This is a pity as blogging could be very effective. Instead of telling us how to do the simplest of thing, which we could pick up in a few minutes in front of a PC, a deeper exploration of how to effecitvely use blogs would have really helped.  Brad makes a big deal out of using photos in Wordpress. I found it straightforward: all I did was upload the photo and drag it into the post box, thus having it in both open boxes. Although I did not expect a lot out of this book, I did expect a little more. Loks like I will have to put this book on the shelf and spend time trawling Wordpress information sites. This defeats the purpose of buying the book 
 Definitely not Freys best but with some judicious skimming you can read it in a few hours.  It is down to a penny used on Amazon and alas that is all it is worth 
 I was hoping this book would be a bit more concrete in suggestions and ways to do exactly what the title implied, but I found it to be too free spirited and 'out there' for my personal liking.  It just wasn't enough to motivate me to give it even 5 bad minutes each morning 
 Badly written book 
 I got nothing to say. Was this supposed to be intense? Was this supposed to be a thriller? It was boring. Horrible acting, except for Forest Whitaker: but even he couldn't save this one. Pure Fincher? Pure trash. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I am just too upset to type, I can't believe I actually waisted my time with this 
 You need a plan, and its going to take work. No Kidding? You need an image. REALLY? When you submit items, you may get turned down - NO?!?! This book is ok if it's your first on the subject, but if you have ANY kind of marketing knowledge, skip it. I came across one idea that I thought, HEY Never thought of that. I had to force myself to finish it. Not enough examples of a press release's or other items (but you have tp PLAN, AND SPELL CHECK - WOW!). He has a chapter on the internet, that again is for the beginner, and almost a beginners guide to html. How about where to promote on the Internet? One positive is the author availability. He publishes all sorts of ways to contact him. It was easily read (although I was frustrated by the end as it wasn't giving me what I wanted). He explains how you can take a press release, reword it, and re-release it. I got the feeling he did that with each chapter. (Sorry Jeff) 
 Davis's treatment repeatedly tells us how boring other histories are until we are bored with the repetition.  Then he gives us the thinnest liberal telling.  White men were all bad, indians were good.  Women were brave.  Conservatives are anti-semites.  Republicans are bad and pro business.  Anti-communism was silly. And all history is filtered through the vietnam protestor's filter. Mr. Davis is boring and totally predictable and has sacrificed accuracy for liberal orthodoxy.  This is offensive when it neglects Margaret Sanger's racism, and communist depredations 
 This book though looks simple and pretends to present concepts in a lucid manner, does not match international standards. Very few examples are present with less/no illustrations. I struggled with this book for almost 2 years to understand the concepts as this book was the only popular book in my UG college and was readily available in our library. It has ideally no practical examples which can easily discourage reader. After reading contemporary books from Prof Roy Yates and Prof Leon-Garcia, I could do little favor for this book by giving 1 star.   However, one who is already thorough with concepts can use this book for revision. There is a huge element of risk involved in starting with this book to learn probability concepts. 
 Beware of the Everyman's Library edition of this book (green hardcover, ribbon marker, isbn # 0-679-40564-X). Book V dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted. According to the introduction, this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low. I wish I had known this BEFORE I ordered the book since now I have to buy a different edition in order to read Book V. What a ripoff 
 Let me say right off the bat, I am a skeptic, but still I loved author Gary Goldschneider's first two books from this series: the Secret Language of Birthdays and the SL of Relationships.  But this one, THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY is a bore.  Rather than offering two pages to each birth date, as Birthdays did, or a half of a page as Relationship did, this book gives the reader a short 1/4 page paragraph that allegedly sums up the destiny of those born in each of the 48 personology periods. This information is so general and by the way so boring that it could relate to anyone if in fact you don't fall asleep reading it.  For this reason, I do not recommend THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY.   -- Regina McMenami 
 Consider the lucky birders.  In North America there are less than 900 species of birds.  While some may be only 3 or four inches long, others are measured in feet.  New birding guides are issued every year.  And while a few species, like the empidonax flycatchers may be difficult to tell apart, all of the species are illustrated in most guides, and 90% are identifiable if the birder gets a good look at them.  Now consider the amateur entomologist.  There are over 80,000 species of insects in North America.  Most insects are relatively small.  Telling the difference between species may require examining the vein pattern in wings.  The field guides to insects illustrate at most 700 insects.  No wonder there are more bird watchers than insect watchers.  And no wonder there hasn't been a major insect field guide published since 1981!  A field guide to insects then probably can't help you identify most specific species.  The authors feel they have done their job if they can help you identify the family.  Unfortunately most, including the Simon & Schuster guide, may not even do that.  To test insect guides I took a series of pictures of each of three insects and then tried to identify them with the help of the guides.  They were pictures of a butterfly-like insect, a bee and a fly.  Simon and Schuster helped me identify the insect order with a table that provided common features of an order and gave its name.  I then was required to flip through the pages describing the orders, which are arranged taxonomicaly, to find a description of the order and the entry numbers of the pictures and descriptions of that order.  (It would have been convenient if the table had listed the page where I could find the order description and the pages where I could have found the initial entries.)  Next I had to flip through the entries, examining each photograph to find an insect that most closely resembled my specimen.  I should note that some guides use drawings while others, like Simon and Schuster use photographs.  My experience is that either method may be more advantageous in a specific case.  For my butterfly-like insect, I immediately identified it as a Brown Skipper.  My bee looked most like a Carpenter Bee, an identification I felt more comfortable with after consulting other guides.  But I could not identify my fly at any level lower than order.  Of the field guides I examined, I found this to be the least satisfactory, both as to convenience, and as to the number of insects shown.  And since one is unlikely to make a precise identification unless on finds exactly the species on is looking for, the more insects the better.  Even though they are only a little better, most people trying to identify insects will probably be happier with the Peterson Guide, "A Field Guide to Insects" by Donald J. Borror and Richard E. White or the "National Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Insects and Spiders" by Loris and Margery Milne 
 I am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book.  Honestly, it was a complete waste of my time.  To quote a friend, it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar.  If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book 
 Some talented DVD editor should take the latest 3 movies, and cut out the dumb scenes (about 75% of each movie) and put them all together to make one decent movie 
 This book is definately not as helpful as the first book.  In this book Brian takes the journey and metaphors a bit too far.  He strays a bit too far from the scriptures to make his point.  Keep to the first book definately more helpful 
 Now obviously the new rap music and great american voices they put on make it as bad as possible.  But then again, the movie certainly is no gem in it's original language version, that is for sure.    The whole movie had above average action sequences, but the story was unbearable.  Not the story itself, but the execution of it is the worst possible.  It goes from sickening moments to almost little kid parts between Jet and teh girl.  Just freaking horrible.    So the dvd is full screened, music is stupid, voice dubbing is almost as bad as the "jet li collection" movies, but you will get a few good points one or two good laughs, and a decent finale.  
  I can't agree with most of these reviews.  I am an O'Brian and Forester veteran and I don't think this book is on the same level at all.  The writing is somewhat stilted and at times he gets lost in his own plot.  Perhaps the other books are better, but I don't plan to find out.  
 There is certain type of naivet that the women in JG novels tend to have that just doesn't work in a modern setting.  And though you could maybe say that an Alfa male is an alfa male in any era, she manages to make them predictably boring.  After a while it just seems like you're reading about the same saccharin sweet characters over and over and over again.  I was a huge fan of her historicals.  And though I have remained faithfull reader so far, I think this book marks the end of the road for me.  Unless, I'm terribly desperate for something to read.  :)  If JG completely refuses to go back to historicals, then maybe she could try Futuristic novels where the virgin planet gets invaded by maurauding males.  Just a thought.  : 
 This really isnt a bad movie if you havent read the book, if you have read the book then think of this as another story based on the same subject. i understand that a book to movie will leave certain things out, and i accept that, but to completely change the ending is not excusable. What was wrong with the way the book ended? Like i said if you havent read the book you will like this movie although they do solve these very complex puzzles after a glance at them(even though they hide a very very valuable secret that will change the world). If you havent read the book or seen the movie do yourself a favor and pick up a copy, its a better story and its cheaper if bought in the paperback, if you dont have time to read it then get it on audio disk or tape 
 If you want bad gourmet recipes, then this is your book. The basic information is poor at best, and the "fancy" gourmet recipes are not even good. When I begin to cook a meal, i'll look in the "joy of cooking", get disappointed, and go and find what I want on the internet. The recipes are what you would expect to eat in the early 20th century. This book should have stayed there. I'm sure your grandma loves it though! squid in ink sauce?! for real? c'mon 
 I'm about 1/2 way there and its a struggle to finish - not Cussler's usual - maybe because there is another author and its not his?  Way too many characters - I'm no dummy, but I have to keep referring to the front of the book to remind myself which one of the "cast of characters" he is talking about because he switches every other paragraph to a totally different scene with totally different characters.  The story isn't bad - but beside the confusion of figuring out who he is talking about and where they are, there is so much extra non essential filler in it that it is hard to get involved in it.  I hope it gets better as it goes along, but I doubt it 
 I bought this book in anticipation of my upcoming trip to VN. Having gotten great help from LP Guides over the years, I was sure that this was the book I needed. Wrong. This book is superficial and only marginally useful. Certainly not what a serious traveler need in VN!  Shame on you, Lonely planet. You can do so much better. 
 My friend who lives in Rome suggested this book. I generally avoid Dan Brown, and sort of wish I had avoided this book.  His research was great, if you can believe all of his information, and the well described locations all over Rome were marvelous, but ........   Two, not one but TWO, men fall out of a helicopter very high above Rome and land unharmed?  Many other plot devises were quite difficult to digest.  Plus, Brown seems to have a personal vendetta for the Catholic Church.  God certainly knows a lot of evil has been done in the name of religion and the church probsably leads the pack, but Brown's problem seems rather personal.  Maybe he was abused by a priest 
 Another book offering limited help to those with asthma. As a sufferer for long enough until I learned about the Buteyko method. If you wish to take control of your condition, this is the only therapy that works and does it very well.   Asthmatics before you buy this book- research the Buteyko method for asthma. You will feel considerably better as I did in a couple of weeks. There are also self help books available to allow you make progress at minimum cost.   The results it has given me have wanted me to wake the world up about what you can do by correcting and changing your overbreathing.  Good luck Mike    
 This book reminds me of many magazine covers: it promises a lot more information than it delivers.  There is very little of any specific help here.  Worse, it sounds like it is written by someone who has no real idea what it is like to live with debilitating chronic pain.  Run 5K??!!  How about, I can't walk around the block?  There is no help offered for people with pain that is more than moderate in nature.  Topics that should receive some real attention are skimmed over in a matter of a couple of pages or even a few paragraphs.  I had expected better from a Mayo Clinic publication.    
 I first of heard of this book when I heard the author on a radio show talk and made the book sound interesting but after reading this book I wish I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and skipped this book. This book shows a whole lot of nothing of the so called chronovizor with a bunch of tid bit informaion making you think maybe a chronovizor is possible. '' what ever skip this book at all costs, a total waste of time 
 When I bought this book I was assuming--perhaps naively--that its title meant that the book would focus on specific things you need to know when planning an outdoor wedding.  I hoped that it would be able to help me with such nitty-gritty details as planning for the possibility of rain and dealing with rentals of items such as chairs and tables.  Instead, I found that the book was, in essence, a wedding planner almost exactly like every other wedding planner on the market, complete with a checklist of what-to-do-when, a breakdown of the expenses according to who "traditionally" pays for them, and pages and pages of advice on picking out the dress and the cake.  Her advice on making a backup plan for rain was confined to one paragraph, the essence of which was "Make sure you have a backup plan for rain."  Not one word on how to go about making such a plan (okay, she did have a short section on the advantages of booking a site with both indoor and outdoor accommodations, but what about those of us who want to use a state park where the only shelter is a pavilion without sides)?  As for rentals, there isn't even a listing in the index for them.  My advice: if you're looking for details, don't bother with this book.  You can find better information on the Web for nothing 
 I really tried to enjoy this book but just couldn't manage to like it by the last page. This story tried to explore the different aspects of family and self, all through the magical Lazelle family. I found it to be simple minded and rambling. I'm not even sure the author was 100% where she was going in this book.   The main character, Gypsum, receives her powers later in life than her family. She was previously cast as the "normal" one, alienated for her differences but attached to her family through tradition and magic. Her relationships with her family are forced and just seem wierd at times. Not once does the author explain how this family fits in with society. Most of the story runs like this: "I almost killed my aunt through cursing a computer that took over our minds. I need a cup of coffee" The author gets lost more than once in direction and the middle of the book is just another magical mistake after another where a point is made then skipped over.   Everything is so strained and just plain wierd that I couldn't get into it. There is no personality in any of the characters. If it weren't for the adult situations and language I would have pegged this as a young adult novel. I think it almost was supposed to be until 3/4 of the way through the book where all of a sudden a lot of the characters are swearing and there is a slight homosexual relationship explored.   I gave it two stars for some interesting parts of the book that kept me from throwing it away and the fact that there is some effort to include statements about family ties. Blah.  
 Look inside this book at a bookstore before you buy it. It is NOT about cabins but about huge lodges-log mansions, if you will. 
 Ayelet Waldman is a graduate of Harvard Law School, so I assume she's an intelligent woman and a good lawyer. She should stick to what she knows. The fact that she's married to a famous author doesn't make her a writer. Her novel is poorly written, overly sentimental and, to put it bluntly, very dumb.  What's next? Padma Lakshmi writing a novel because she's married to Salman Rushdie?  
 This system does an adequate, but not great, job of decoding digital S/PDIF audio with volume adjust for center, surround, and subwoofer.  It has several simple digital decode modes.  A fair value for $100, but if I had to do it again, I would prefer a lower end home theatre receiver with speakers, which often start around $150.  These speakers show significant distortion at fairly modest volume levels.  However, they are adequate sound for my small home office at lower volumes 
 Under no circumstances read this book! Its plot is thin, predictable and riddled with tensions resolved, apparently, by the hands of magical little elves. For the spy novel fan, or fan of any novel, you will find it quite familiar and completely unsurprising as it consists mostly of cliche scenes. The final scene of the book is predictable, disgusting, and disappointing. The narration is done in contemporary American English and many stereotypical colloquialisms and accents are reversed; these are the book's only clever devices. This is done to establish the feel that Europeans and Americans are alien and that the Russians are familiar. I found some of the anachronisms in the book's narrative style to be distracting. Reading this book was a very unpleasant experience for me. I wish I had stopped after the conclusive explanation of the early criminal investigation 
 I could not get into this book.  The storyline was dull and so were the characters.  Not recommended 
 this is too funny Ohio exit polling must have been much like Illinois?  I voted Bush and afterwards was Swarmed by 3 thug looking "exit pollers" who looked angry when they asked me who I voted for   "Kerry" was my response... they happily jotted it down.  so much for the exit poll conspiracy.  please don't slice my tires !!!!  
 I saw this with a group of Strangers with Candy fans, and everybody was pretty disappointed.  Each scene of the series was overflowing with humorous touches - the film is strangely sedate.  At the same time, a ton of jokes are lifted straight from the television show.  The things they don't lift are missed - why did they swap Gerri's manically comatose father for Dan Hedaya laying peacefully in bed 
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
 Sorry, Rey.  I see you took the time to write a review. Next time I lend you abook I'll be sure to read it more closely first 
 The book is "Utterly disappointing and entirely uninsightful."   Much better hard information on the Goetz case can be found at Wikipedia.com and in a juror's book "Subway Gunman. 
 I should have read the subtitle closer - *HOW* to stop wasting our brightest young minds.  If there was any indication of *WHY* to stop wasting bright minds, I slept right through it.  If noone understands *WHY*, there's no reason to care about *HOW* 
 I purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend.  I will start out by saying that when I first purchased this frame, I loved it.  The display, contrast and brightness were great.   However, after 5 short months, the display's pixels started acting funny.  They get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage.  Turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about 60 seconds and then it's back to bad pixels.    Myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue.  In conclusion - it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons. 
 Actually, the song from the house robbery is "7 & 7's", by the Ramones from the album Acid Eaters. Another song unlisted and also hard to find is a Love cover-song called "Anything", performed by the Damned 
 I bought this stuff from the Shopping Channel, and thought it wasn't bad, until I went to get my hair colored.  The color didn't take! My hair is shoulder length, and I only used the Ojon on the bottom 5 or 6 inches, because that's the part that was dry.  The color only took on the 'new growth', not on the rest of my hair - the hair that I had put the Ojon on!  The smell of the oil, the shampoo, or the conditioner didn't bother me, but the HAIR SPRAY was disgusting. People remarked that I had overdosed on perfume, so I had to wash it again to get the rotten smell out of my hair. I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who colors their hair. 
 This documentary reveals the shocking fact that companies, by law, have an obligation to their stockholders, rather than to society at large.  But this isn't the only case where 'people' by law are required to focus on only certain responsibilities.  What about doctors?  When a doctor treats you, by law that doctor is supposed to think only about what is best for you.  Shouldn't she really also be thinking about whether others would be better off if you were out of the way?  Shouldn't she give you an injection that would peacefully put you to sleep if she feels that society as a whole would be better off without you?    And what about accountants and lawyers?  Every time an accountant handles someone's money, he should be legally obligated to consider whether it would benefit society to take half of the person's life savings and give it to charity.  It's wildly inappropriate for your accountant to be legally obligated to handle your money in your interests.  What about the greater good?  And your lawyer should never act mainly for you - each and every lawyer should be expected to consider everyone equally, rather than giving special emphasis to her own client.  Let's get serious - in order for a corporation to act in the interests of its stockholders, who are the last in line in case of bankruptcy, it must first meet all obligations to others, or else there will be nothing left for those stockholders waiting at the end of the line.  As an ongoing business, companies have reason to care about their reputations, about earning loyalty from their employees, etc.  Yes, some companies have done bad things, just as some people have done bad things.  Can every single person be condemned as a psychopath, simply because there are some examples of humans that were considered psychopaths?    Corporations, like people, can do harmful, dangerous things.  There's no doubt that many of the problems documented here actually occurred.  But it is the reponsibility of government to regulate corporations, just as it regulates people.    The example of Bolivia, where people were forbidden from collecting rainwater, is an example of the failure of government.  Why would the government give such rights to anyone, even itself?  But when government regulation has been adequate, privatization of water and many other services has been hugely beneficial to the poor in most countries.  Demonizing corporations for faithfully managing the money invested in them is ridiculous.  Corporations, and individuals, should be regulated by governments.  If outrages are not detected and punished, then government has failed.  But we shouldn't abolish government, or corporations, or people, simply because none are perfect.  We should 1) hold governments accountable for performing their role; 2) hold corporations accountable for legal violations (through fines, and through sending corporate executives to jail in extreme cases, as has happened many, many times); and 3) use public pressure and our own personal buying decisions to give corporations an incentive to make socially responsible decisions.  If you really care about the poor around the world, then put the blame and the pressure where it belongs - on bad government 
 I bought a copy of the report feeling that I ought to research the government's account of the events of 9/11.  That is of course, exactly what I got.  Questions so basic as why the Air Force couldn't prevent the first, second, and third crash, or why the towers collapsed when no steel superstructure building ever fell as a result of fire in all of history before that day, are left unasked and uninvestigated.  Additionally, there is no index (a lot like the original Warren Report volumes detailing the events of JFK's assassination), which is absolutely unforgivable for this type of book.  This report is, to a large degree, official subterfuge.  It answers no important questions and its recommendations are as ridiculous as they are ineffectual.  The US government purpose here was obviously to create an interpretation of the events of 9/11 that neither hold anyone accountable, nor suggest constructive anti-terror policy.  This book angers me a great deal.  It should anger you too 
 When I got this gun, I thought it looked really cool, but when I tried to shoot it, the bullets just rolled out of the barrell!  The few bullets that did shoot worked well.  I did not have a good experience with this gun 
   I liked the first two spy kids movies pretty well. The first one was well done and the acting great. The second one, was maybe a bit less than the first but still entertaining. This movie, however, was incredibly lame and absolutely boring.    My brother went to see it with my mom in theaters, and for some reason they came back saying it was soooo good. When it came out on DVD I watched it with my brother. Only twenty minutes into it I was wishing I could leave. All the "Amazing" 3-D, Computer animated sequences were giving me terriblel headaches and I no reason whatsoever to watch this drivel.    As a previous reviewer said, the spy kids series lost its charm after the second installment. In this movie they were trying to go out with a bang, but fell miles short of the finish line. The acting seemed stale and unemotional. The humor was lame and not even funny. And the whole things seemed like a weird dream the director thought might make a decent movie.    Overall, it seems to me that this was just one mega test for the even worse flop "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl". I have no appreciation for this director any more and unless he gives us something good fast, I probably won't be watching anymore of his films any time soon 
 and since the previous one was absolutely amazing, this one is....I threw it out the car window. I've never heard such boring and random acts wimp ness as this recording is. So sticking to my trend next one should be much better 
 I thought this book was totally mean-spirited and filled with sadism that would certainly scare any child.  In fact, I believe that there is little, if anything, positive to say about this book.  Children look up to the adults in their lives, especially to their teachers, and this book portrays the teacher as cruel and nasty. This book was deeply disturbing for both myself and more importantly, for my son 
 not very "thought-provoking" as the book claims, just get Gregory Stock's Book of Question's instead if you ARE looking for a true "conversation piece". 
 The book tells you what women do wrong but it does not really teach you how to do it right. The authors interview a lot of people who may know something about the topic but they do not do so in depth. They then string together a  lot of quotes without real analysis and practical how to. I should have known from the introduction that the authors were not experts in this area 
 This book, although it covers a broad range of topics, does not adequately cover any of them.  I teach sewing and bough this book thinking it might be good to use as a text, and was very disappointed.  The pictures are hard to see, the directions vague.  If I did not know what they meant already, I never would have been able to figure it out from this text.  I do not recommend this book to any seamstress at any level 
 As I read this book, I kept thinking it would get exciting, eventually take off....but it never did.   Linda is so ordinary...I wanted to scream...I love colorful, quirky, interesting people...She's as drab as a worn eraser. I could imagine seeing her on a reality TV show..answering the question..what have you that's unique, interesting?  The answer  a long "duh".....Why is it that the eternally boring and clueless become therapists?   Misery loves company???  Linda never came to the conclusion "what have I to offer"...instead it's always me! me! me! like a three-year-old.  Courtney had a twisted father and a wimpy mother.. I didn't realize what an exciting person I was til I read her book....If I wrote my memoir it would floor you....but I don't want the numerous miscreants I know...to come gunning for me...I'd like to live a bit longer..  
 Droning vocals. Was hoping for so much more. Where is the passion? This CD is a total bore. Don't even feel I can pass it along 
 Halo 1 on steroids, Halo 2 is a clear Microsoft stamp on Bungie's creativity and control and it muddies up what was a balanced gameplay.  A hackneyed single player story that makes no sense, and has no flow, along with levels that aren't replayable.  You thought the Library from Halo1 was tedious?  Try the headache inducing map design in this game.  Also in the nonsense, the unneccesary switch to an Elite's perspective for half the game, along with a new group of Covenant bad guys that look like rejects from a Captain Planet cartoon.  Apes with mohawks, yeah, nice design.  I can only play one or two levels of the single player, and they are so noobish, it loses appeal quickly.   On to Multiplayer.  Okay, in 2004 upon release, this was a great game.  It took time to go up in level, and the ranking system wasn't as abused as it is now.  Once new maps, kept on the harddrive (read mod kids) were released by Bungie, that opened the door to full blown chaos.  Now 2 years later, modding has died down somewhat, but a whole new slew of bridging and connection speed manipulation makes it roughly 25% likely you'll find a game with no lag.  So I still play on occasion, it's lame they can't offer dedicated servers so you can play your map of choice, choose servers with good connections, and then the modders and big gun noobs can find the type of game they want to play too.  I only pray Halo 3's multiplayer improves on this system, otherwise I'm done with the Xbox console permanently 
 If you like the Dirk Pitt series & the Kurt Austin series, don't bother reading this book! The action is NOT there, nor is the intrigue that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series.  This book was not as 'action-packed' as the two other series, and left me wishing the book to be over.  I had to 'make' myself finish the book, and even then, my only comment was "That's it?!" It's definitely NOT the 'page-turner' type story that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. And, to be honest, I miss the 'cameo' appearances of the author in the Pitt novels 
 Sheets and comforter are cute, my son loves them, but they are paper thin. You can see right through the sheets, and they are a little rough. So far my son hasn't complained, but I do not expect the sheets to last too long. 
 I have to agree with many of the reviewers here who have mentioned that, although the recipes all sound interesting and Silverton's discussion of wild yeast starters is useful for avid bread bakers, this is not at all a practical book to use. I love to bake bread, but the thought of feeding a starter 3 times a day seems incredibly expensive/wasteful(both in terms of time and money!). Good bread can be made with much less time and cash. I would recommend Peter Reinhart's book, "The Bread Baker's Apprentice", for its excellent and straight-forward bread recipes. His recipes are also for the "conossieur, but they do not require that you become a slave to your bread-baking habit 
 This book has won the Hugo award and may have had a tremendous impact when it first came out, unfortunately it is now greatly outdated.  While some books hold up better over the course of time, this one did not.  Looking purely at the science involved in the book I'll give Leiber credit for at least thinking of it.  It's a nice premise to theorize the gravitational impact of what would happen to the Earth if a planet the same size as it called, "The Wander" suddenly appeared in space next to it.  He does a decent job covering the effects this would cause to the Earth and the Moon with the changing of the tides, flooding, earth quakes, and volcanic activity, but I think he may have missed the effects that the gravitational pull of Earth would have had on "The Wander" as well.  I also had trouble with several of the characters who seem right out of the 60's.  In the 60's there must have been a great deal of mistrust between the populous and the government and several of the characters reflect this feeling in that, "The Man", or "The Fuzz" are out to get them.   It also appeared that there had been no advances in science on the Earth since the 60's but yet we have a manned base on the Moon and have astronauts out by Mars.  It just didn't add up 
 The author of this book needs to learn proper home inspection procedures before he sells himself as knowledgable. I have been inspecting homes for 19 years and often give lectures on the topic. After reading most of this book I realized what a waste of money it was because the information was incorrect or incomplete. I can't believe how many mistakes I found in this book. I'm glad I returned it for a refund on my money but not happy I wasted my time reading it 
 So I still need to see the 2nd one again after not seeing it for many many years, but here is my review for this dvd.     Kickboxer 3 - These types of movie are SO difficult to watch. The characters are all acting ok, but the storyline is on par with any linear story that has ever been done. I wish that I could give this a good review cause I like cody from step by step, and he can't do anything great in terms of high quick legs or really fast fist forms, but he does make up a little but for that in his power. Though the action director doesn't showcase it, you can tell that cody has plenty of power. I would love to give you some long review and give you the whole storyline but , you know what, I guess I can, Cody is going to a tournament, a guy doesn't want him to fight in it so his guy can win, so this guy acts nice at first and then when cody won't accept an invitation to throw a fight for money, he gets mean and since he is also like a slave trader he decides to put cody through some hell training with 1 enjoyable moment out of like 8 scenes.   Alright so i reviewed the story only because it is no goddang simple.   Overall this movie is not suggested by me and you should only watch it if you have seen every good kungfu movie, and I haven't even come close, so this sucked.   -----------------------------------------------------------------  Kickboxer 4 - Now this movie actually had the potential to be good unlike the last one. You get the impression that they are actually going to have a tournament in this one and they almost give you double digits in fights.   Since this was almost watchable, I will go over the strong points:   -Hot girl who can fight, always a good thing.  -Cody getting to show off a little bit and he actually looks decent in this one.  -Having a tournament and actually showing some fights, none that are good, but some that I would give a 2/5.  -Even hotter girl-this one even gets down.   Horrible things about this movie:   -Guy who looks like the abd guy from original kickboxer is really hard to look at. If you are gonna get a look-a-like, at least get a fighter, and maybe he can fight, but if he can, let him. So something was very wrong there, and almost as bad as that was his make up. They used a very tan person so when he took off his shirt, his face looked white in comparison to his golden skin. Very hard to watch.  -Guy who is a b movie actor and can fight, but acting ability can be rivaled by any male soap opera star.  -Bad guy doesn't notice cody is in the tournament until the end.  -This aspect of the movie is so bad that it is funny. Every time cody would fight, something would distract him from seeing cody's face like his girl being kissed, truly funny stuff.   So final fight ranks #384,225th on my all-time list, pretty good. 
 These authors appear to be able scholars in the sense that they can gather facts and information. Unfortuanately, they are either unaware of their own religious bias or are being dishonest. In either case, this bias spoils the book.  In the chapter on magic and miracles there is no mention of Christian, or particularly Mormon, miracles. There is no mention of the belief of some Christians that the host is magically transformed into the body of Christ or that revelation has been magically brought to earth by angels. Worst of all, the authors characterize the religious understanding that "all is one" as an ego-based desire for power. Never mind that perhaps a majority of this planet's population understand that as a spiritual truth. Religious war and strife begins with this kind of intolerance and arrogance.  The authors also classify "Gnosticism," which is a scholarly category for non-orthodox early Christian beliefs, as "occult." There is no rational reason to classify alternative early Christian thought as occult while treating what the authors call "normative Christianiy" as not occult. The only difference is that the authors apparently believe in one and not the other.  In the chapter on the Nazi, the authors try to characterize the roots of anti-Semitism as "occult," completely ignoring the facts that European anti-Semitism grew out of the Christian belief that "the Jews" killed Jesus and that anti-Semitism had prevaded and festered in European Christianity for centuries. The autors also fail to mention that the vast majority of Nazi were Christians.  I am not at all opposed to a direct and honest promotion of Christianity, but I deeply object to dishonest attempts to misrepresent and miscategorize other points of view. This is just the modern form of demonization, where other viewpoints are made demonic. They used to be labeled heresy, now they are labeled occult 
 Otherwise trustworthy Bionaire has produced a defective model. I've been through two of them now, both with similar problems. They tend to shut off despite enough water being in the tank, and no other visible problem. First one never worked right, the second lasted for two months before it continually flashed the reset light. Customer service could offer no solutions. Stay away 
 Tony Yayo's "Thoughts of a Predicate Felon" suffers from the fact that Tony Yayo simply doesn't know who he is (or who he is supposed to be) on this album. Before I listened to this album, I expected to hear gritty, descriptive rhymes about Yayo's criminal life. Unfortunately however, I, like many of you, tuned into tracks such as "Tattle Teller," "Curious," and "Project Princess." For an ex-convict, that is not the type of message you want to project to an audience that is expecting something more... hardcore; something better. On tracks such as "Live By The Gun" and "Homicide," Yayo delivers my aforementioned desire for "harder" lyrics, but tracks such as these are few and far between. Hopefully Tony Yayo can focus on doing this for his next album but for now, this debut album is simply a dissapointment 
 The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all.  The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case.  How does she resolve her dilemma?  By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity.  Lame!   And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere.  I don't know what "K" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out 
 This book started off slow with the formation of the Hawaiian islands and just continued from there.  The second chapter was more insightful and interesting but it seemed to drag.  Several pages could have been cut or edited out.  It would have been better if this book moved through the years a little more swiftly, than dragging to each persons life.  It was very difficult to finish and this is one book I will not re-read again.  It was about as interesting as a school text book, without a teacher to bring out the lesson 
 My God, I was forced to read this book for a construction management class at a four-year university in the United States and struggled through every minute.  I don't know what was more frustrating, having to read this dull-minded and repetative junk or reading four words at a time because for whatever reason the prestigious author, Christopher Day, was forced to go against conventional thinking and put two columns on each page.  This was hands down the worst book I have ever read throughout my life.  The guy is hypocritical of everyone who lives in an ordinary house and works in an ordinary job in an ordinary office building.  Sorry Mr. Day, but most of us don't have the time and monetary security to write a 200-page book regarding soulful places.  We just trudge off to work everyday in our non-biologically inducing office buildings.  A bunch of junk 
 It's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying.  The majority of Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about.  The characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it.  Peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets.  Somehow, Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during PMS.  The only decent characters in this book are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story.  I admit it: I only made it a little over half-way through Children of the Mind.  I couldn't take the dialogue anymore.  That's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of Japanese and Polynesian culture, in an attempt to avert a war between species.  If you're that curious to learn how the Ender Quartet concludes, do what I should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage 
   Face it, NO fan: you already have all the songs on Singles.  New Order have been releasing best-of rehashes after every album since Republic.  Of course this one offers nothing new.  One reviewer mentioned the original versions of Temptation and Confusion, but those can be found on the superior Retro box set 
 It was about a 12 year old boy and his best friend and baby brother.They pretend that  the tornado is just not goning to happen but the weather channel says a tornado is going to hit ground. Dan and his best friend think thats it not going to happen but then the winds start to howl and it starts to rain and hail.  Then the boys know they should have listened!  Read it to see what happens to them 
 I try not to judge my vids the first time I do them because the bulk of my fitness dvd collection (which is very large) are comprised of ones that took some getting used to, but that I ended up loving.  This was not one of them - I have given this one 5 chances, and I still dislike it VERY much.  The set is SO cheesy, and so is Kathy.  Unfortunately, this is my first Kathy video - I have heard she has some good ones, but I am completely turned off by her and will not purchase another.  The timing was off, and even after I mastered the steps, they did not feel effective.  Sorry Kathy, I am looking elsewhere 
 This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????  Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.    Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.    The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.   
  After hearing Christiane on PBS I really thought the c d package would be directed at developing a friendship with your mother after reaching adulthood. Why they act the way they do, how to see their words and actions through their eyes, understanding them and letting the pain they cause drop away. But this c d is directed at mothers with girls still living at home. How to raise them so they have self pride, integrity and can handle finances. Only the first tape talked about mothers and daughters over 35. It was a waste of my money. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Up until this album I have like every Sugar Ray album.  Even though they went from bad asses to more contemporary rock, the self-titled and 14:59 were still good.  In fact I think they showed the most talent on 14:59 and the Self-Titled was a good feel good album.  Now to this album, "the new one".  You know your careers over when you've been a rock band forever and then include a rap/rock song on your album.  What the hell was going on?  Did Sugar Ray really even write that Bartender song?  Were they offered a barrel of cash to write crappy songs? I don't know, I just hope the next CD has some meaning to it.  Go back to any other style you want to or don't, just stop getting pussified...please!!!  Anyone who reads this, DON'T buy this CD 
 I am relatively new to craps. I can play but don't really understand the nuance of the game. Saw the reviews and bought it.   I find John's banter intolerable: "macho type dude, with muscles bigger than Dolly Pardon's trademarks," "Does Sophia Loren look like a boy?". I'm sure it a generational thing. It's kind of like having Buddy Love teach you trigonometry.   Anyway, some good information that's just really hard to get to. I'm looking for something modern and less dramatic.  
 If you're looking for a book that will give you a concise and easy to remember strategy for integrating work and fun--FISH! is the one I'd recommend.  In FUN Works, the author presents ELEVEN principles that are supposed to help us "understand the importance of the Fun/Work Fusion."  With eleven principles, this book is all over the place, and somehow misses the mark. I fervently believe that work should be FUN, but I didn't find this book particularly helpful in understanding how to make it that way 
 I love Peterson's Guides, but the birds of Mexico is severely lacking.  The art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to North America, but unfortunately, it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other Peterson Guides.  Perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of Peterson Guides, but otherwise, buy Howell's or Edward's Guides, both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone.  Howell's is certainly the most complete, but Edward's guide is a bit handier in the field 
 This book provides a simple description of a long list of things.  Good for a quick reading.  But, there are too many errors and beginners should be cautioned 
 I love Sophia Loren as an actress however this DVD as 3 movies in one package is a very very very poor quality DVD. Colors are bad, picture is bad and the sound is even worse. don't waste your money. My DVD copy was bought from Amazon.  this is my advic 
 I have read all of Bryson's books and loved them. Intuition said to NOT but this book since reliving childhood has been done time and time again. In my opinion, the TITLE of this book is the only creative part of the book - sure, Bryson can be funny but this book reeks of being forced. Really not worthly of what the author has done in the past. We have heard all of this before. Save your money or go to the library 
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 After reading this book and reading most of the posts, I can say that the ones who disagree with S. Hannity stole my thoughts. S. Hannity is good at yelling at guests on his tv show but nothing else. He never offers a thoughtful opinion and he argues with the stomach and never uses his brain. If you like controversy then buy Bill O'reilly and Michelle Malkin's books at least those two try their best to get their points across. Hannity's book is a waste of many even though it's only 5 dollars (you can buy two Mcdonald chicken sandwiches for that price).  
 There are 3 or 4 good songs on this CD. If you want to purchase it to make your own compilation for your kids they will love a few of them. Others are WAY to slow and boring for kids to get excited about. There are a couple of them that make no sense at all on a chilren's CD. It seems like they couldn't decide whether to make a CD to put kids to sleep or to pep them up so they did both on one CD. That doesn't work for my kids. John Lithgow "Singin in the Bathtub" is a MUCH better choice. The songs are upbeat and lively. My kids ask for that one all the time 
 Thank goodness my wife and I rented this movie because it is a one-viewing-only experience. We are introduced to Patrick Swayze's character and he seems the country hayseed who just got off the train from Booniesville. Later, we learn he's been "all over the world". Then we have to endure watching Lisa Neimi having, or reliving, her repeated emotional breakdowns. Boo hoo. Oh, don't forget George De La Pena. One minute he's prodding the two former lovers, (Swayze and Neimi), into dancing the production they've all reunited to do. The next he's crying at his makeup table because he never believed he, himself, could complete the darn task. Oh please!!! The story is so full of drama queens it's beyond belief!!! I have to admit that my wife and I spent most of the movie chuckling at the acting, the story and finally the lover's dance sequences. My major complaint was we hardly got to see these "great dancers" dance. There were plenty of waist up shots of the pair emoting their polarizing love/hate feelings. Demonstrations of their dance skill? It seemed to be a case of hiding their weaknesses. And, then there's Neimi's fatherless daughter. It wasn't too hard to figure out who's daddy. This plotline is so tired and comes at you thousands of miles before it's revealed. No surprise here.   Now let's be real. The threesome, who are supposed to be saving this dance company with their performance, were all pushing their mid 40's when we see the flashbacks of seven years prior!!! Now the movie is trying to convince us that not one, but three people are going to beat the odds, and are expected to perform like the kiddies?!?!? As I said, we had to hold back the giggles.  Three things of note should be added here:   1. Watch the extra feature on this DVD. Neimi and Swayze, (real life husband and wife), show SO MUCH more of an emotional connection there than they ever could muster for the movie's performance. When not of the wooden variety, their emotional range swung to a stupefying over acting. Again, boo-hoo.   2. The movie's lighting director and photographer should have been fired on the spot. Miss Neimi  looks quite ancient and Swayze looks like his face is plastic. During one scene Patrick wants to practice a jump-catch!!! We cringed because it was like telling us our grandma was going to make the same attempt. We were convinced if Lisa fell it would be the preverbal "old woman" breaking her hip. Again, refer to the extra features. They look quite pleasant and Neimi looks like she may even be able to pull this wishing well story off.  3. Lastly, I would say the sequences with the other dancers gathered for this movie were very good. They were quite entertaining to watch and were performed with inventive choreography. Three cheers for the understudies!!! Hurrah, Hurrah, Hurrah!!!  I have mixed emotions about this film. On one hand I like to root for the "old-timer" who makes good. On the other, it is tremendously embarrassing watching "old people" look foolish. Unfortunately my rooting turned to laughing in disbelief. Rent, don't buy, this movie as ironic camp and for the intermittent supporting dancers' sequences. 
 Positives about this book is that, unlike other books which offer "cure", nowhere does Null states or implies that the book is intended to cure or eliminate any sort of disease or illness, besides that aspect, the book is largely disappointing. Unfortunately much of the information contained here can be found on the Internet, but there are several problems as well.  In certain illness or diseases he can state up to 30-50 possible herbs/vitamins (which can be confusing at times). The problem is that for some of them he is reluctant to tell you the appropriate dosages to take. Secondly, there side effects, for example; take 200 B6 over the long run can cause nerve damage, which brings up the next point, which he is reluctant to tell the precautionary details of combining certain herbs and supplements, which can be toxic and deadly. You can't just tells the reader, take this take that, and not tell them what might happen. For example he recommends Echinacea, for cancer, and CTS, and other health problems, but in certain cases Echinacea has been known to cause, liver inflammation, kidney failure, or irregular heart rate. That just one example of many herbs that can be toxic....  This is book that pretty much, I or you can make just by going to the library, and the internet searching for diseases and illness, but somebody who is scholar, and has PhD, should not take the short cut to make easy $$$, and just throw information, without and facts research. IN THE END YOU CAN'T DISTINGUISH THIS BOOK FROM WHAT YOU READ ON THE INTERNET, SO THAN YOU HAVE TO ASK YOU'RE SELF THIS QUESTION? WHY BOTHER BUYING IT.  P.S this absolutely not the "whole encoylopedia" of natural healing, he leaves out a few hundred other major disease/ilness. 
 Brought this home and immediately there are problems: it will only work if the unit is tilted. So I put a napkin folded up under one side it works..but seems a little silly. There is some sensor in there that needs to be in contact with water and somehow mine only works with the "leaning tower" approach..avoid this one 
 I ordered this DVD for my public library's collection along with the English language version.  THEY ARE THE SAME DISC!  They have the same label numbers.  The only difference is a small paper label on the 'Spanish' version's disc declaring that it's dubbed in Spanish. Both the English and Spanish dubbed discs have the exact same content - soundtracks in both languages.  Shame on Disney/Buena Vista for this horrible marketing ploy 
 This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.  Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.  This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this.  
 == quote  But, as Nansook Hong reveals in this devastating tell-all account, Sun Myung Moon does not live up to his own teachings. He has frequent affairs, which he rationalizes as "providential", that is, mandated by God.   == end quote   == quote   "My own parents saw no evidence of sexual misconduct when they were each recruited independently to join the church in Seoul."  (In the Shadow of the Moons, pp. 26-27)   == end quote    I know the UM since the mid 1970's and for a quite a long time the only accusation leveled against Rev. Moon was that he was married 4 times (while in fact he is only married 2 times) later those allegations of just being married 4 times was changed to having had sex with female followers.    Chung Hwa Pak, one of Rev. Moon's first disciples, caused considerable controversy by confirming these accusations in a text widely circulated by critics (and later published in Japanese) called The Tragedy of the Six Marys. Pak, who had left the Unification Church, claimed that Rev. Moon practiced during the church's early years sex rituals with, among others, six married female disciples ("the six Marys") who were to have prepared the way for the virgin who would marry him and become the True Mother. The church vehemently denied the allegations. Pak eventually returned to the fold and, shortly before dying, recanted all the accusations in a second text he authored in 1995, called The Apostate.   Similar accusations were discussed earlier in libel cases in Korea and not proved. In 1989, after a ten-year legal case, the Seoul District Criminal Court (79 ko dan 3372) convicted a protestant minister, Rev. Shin Sa-hun, of criminal libel after his accusations of sexual misconduct could not be proved. In another case decided by the Seoul District Civil Court (83 ga hap 3012), damages were paid by Tak Myung-hwan, a well-known critic of the Unification Church, to a woman who had been accused of having an illegitimate son with Rev. Moon and to her son.   Corrections were published by the Christian newspapers Gidok Shinbo on October 8, 1983, and Hanhook Gidok Gongbo, on October 1, 1983, after printing similar accusations of sexual misconduct in the early Unification Church. Part of the retraction stated, "The article 'The Secret Sexual Practices of the Unification Religion' was a repetition of information published during the 1950s, and we have found it to have no basis in fact."  
 I didn't love it. In fact it took me a month to read it. I'd flip through the stories, read one, skip the next...I eventually read all of them. I didn't like the L.A. Banks story at all, but then again, I hated "Minion." If I tried to write as "ethnic" as she does, my review would say, "Oh vey! The schmaltz in that story made me messhugana! So much mishigas for a little shtup!" Enough already. I liked the Charlaine Harris story, that was worth reading. Overall, phooey on this collection.  I've read novels by most of the authors and enjoyed them more than the individual stories here, with the exception of Jim Butcher; I didn't like his Dresden books but thought the story here was well written and interesting.  I really like the paranormal genre so this book was a dissapointment for me.  
 Granted, it must be challenging to be a writer when one's father is Arthur Miller. This book was receiving raves and I was so surprised to discover it was basically downright bad! Unreadable, frankly. I forced my way through the stories. They were full of cliched and vague descriptions, bland dialogue, and too many oh-so-quirky characters. More than one story had flashbacks ( one story had two: A 4 years ago flashback within a  1 year ago flashback). More than one story had a character recounting her dreams. Boring!!!!  Save your money and your time. 
 If you want to waste your money on a useless product, then buy shedender. The people that give it a decent review on this site do so because it removes a lot of hair (specifically undercoat). However, my guess is that you are considering this product because you want less shedding. The rub is that the undercoat doesn't shed (not that much anyway) the top coat does. So all your doing with shedender is removing the undercoat that isn't the root of your shedding problem in the first place, and is needed for protection from the cold should you have a pet that goes outside.  As I said, this product does remove a lot of hair. However, after a full session with the shedender, I went back to my regular wire brush and brushed out just as much hair as I usually do. The next day, I wired out just as much as I would have if I didn't use shedender. The bottom line, your pets shed from their top coat, not the bottom coat; so you're wasting your time and money with this product 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 I had to read this book for an English class.   It's just a collection of articles of people interviewing Clint Eastwood through the years.  Want to know how he makes movies?  He shoots the first take, moves fast and comes in under budget.  His history is told over, and over, and over, and over.  Nice to read if you run out of sleeping pills 
 The description for this item is not accurate. I bought the freeze deied raspberries and stawberries from this same company and they are great. However, these are dehydrated which means 2 important things: - Texture: these are very hard and do not soften if left in milk or water. Don't think about adding these to cereal, only for trail mix or eating out of hand. - Saturated fat: the second ingredient is coconut oil! One 2oz. serving has 190 calories, 19 grams of fat and 16 grams of saturated fat. You're better off eating Cheetos.  These are extremely unhealthy and don't even taste that great. There is (unsurprisingly) and oily aftertaste. Buyer beware. Stick to purely freeze dried fruits - nothing is added and they are healthy 
 Surprisingly sleaze and Chauvinism by female Director Heckerling! She duplicated it in Chevy Chase vehicle National Lampoon's European Vacation too! Many child actors got their start here, but the thing that cracked me up,  as I saw it when it came out (unfortu- nately) was the dialog of my fav band, Cheap Trick: Ticket scalper "...The magntism of Robin Zander and the  charisma of Rick Nielsen...and what about the tunes, 'I Want You To Want Me, The Dream Police...nan-nan-nah, 'You're momma's alright, your daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird, Surrender, surrender...", before he's  interrupted. If that isn't somebody's idea of 'Surrender', they've stumbled  onto this review by mistake 
 Don't waste your time.  10 books that could really be done in two.  Each volume is worse than the previous.  This guy is just trying to fill pages so sell more books, page after page of mindless babble with now value to the story line or even realted to the story line.  I'm actually goi9ng to throw these int he trash since I've finished them (I finish ewvery serties I start.)  I don't want anyone to have to go through having to read this stuff.  The unfortunate thing is that it is a good story line.  IF money grubbing did not get in the way he coul dhave done ti in three or four.  IF you're curious try the first one and take my word the next 9 are just more descriptions of the clothing.  
 "Hedda Gabler" has to be one of the most boring plays I have ever read.  If you're looking for action in a play, then stay away from this one.  Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll House" was mesmerizing and captivating, and this play is the exact opposite.  There was no point to the plot and the ending served no purpose.  Hedda was bored - that's the point; just shameful.  I do not recommend 
 This book was a huge disappointment. Sue Grafton and Kinsey meander all over California but come up with nothing of substance. The author spent more time describing the decor of a hospital room than explaining the murder motive. The characters and their actions are bogus and contrived. For example, Kinsey becomes emotionally attached to a young prostitute she met two days before. It doesn't work because it isn't real. It is Sue Grafton bending her characters into grotesque positions as she tries to force a plot into this dull mess. The story makes little sense as we try to follow the seemingly interminable clues and innumerable side characters. When it was all over, I still didn't know why the murders had been committed.  Save your eyesight! Do not bother picking up this book 
 The author cannot seem to grasp that there is much discontent amongst the people. She swallows the Islamic doublespeak about women's rights but I'm sure she wouldn't tolerate one tenth of what Iranian women must endure. Also she is fixated on being a blonde in Iran. Weird 
 I don't usally buy Buffy YA titles, I just stick to the adult ones. But I read the back cover and desided to take a gamble. And it reenforced my promise never to read Buffy YA books. Scott Ciencin spends way too much time on his own chacters, and on Dawn and Buffy, that there zero cacterzaion for anyone else, ie Willow or Xander for exsample. To the point of all the story really needed was the man's own chacters, and Buffy and Dawn. Everyone else plays such a small role I don't know why Scott put them in there at all. It was so bad I couldn't even finsh the book... 
 This "toy" is the biggest waste of money! When I got it, there were few reviews out about it.  It is very complicated to use and the web site never works and there is nothing to do on it when it does.  They should be repaying all of us our money for having bought this! Don't waste your money 
 I called Garmin tech support yesterday (10/17), did wait about 15 minutes to speak to someone.  I called in the morning so it wasn't a long wait.  Since my nuvi is still under warranty (1 year warranty) I requested a RMA for a replacement suction cup mount.  The tech asked how it had failed -- mine also had melted to the windshield so I had to rip it off -- and responded like he was very familiar with the problem.  He also mentioned the rubber material of the original design was defective and that they had a new rubber material design and would send me a new one.  I didn't have to pay for it and should get here in 7-10 days 
 I bought this set of four stoppers for use with my Metrokane Rabbit Vacuum Pump because I was not getting good results with the two that came with the pump.  With the 4 stoppers from this set, I was able to form a seal and create a vacuum, however, the vacuum lasts only a few hours, no matter what bottle it was being used on.  I do not recommend this product 
 This was my first Deaver book...and my last.  The suspense factor was "ok", but the sections on scuba were ridiculous.  A diver (with only 25 logged Caribbean clear-water dives) goes into a new NY/NJ wreck, alone (no dive buddy), on a single tank.  And the Coast Guard approves this dive...laughable.  Then once in the wreck, the diver goes down a dumbwaiter passageway measuring 2' by 2', without taking off any gear!!!    You might ask why I point this out...The above was 2 chapters, not just some passing reference, a very material piece of the story.  If this one section [which I know something about] is that outlandish, what does that say for the other sections that I'm not as informed about.  Complete Science Fiction!!!  You are better off reading tea leaves than this book. 
 This is At The Drive-In's weakest album. It must appeal to more straight-on punks, since most of the other reviews seem pretty positive, but for a more casual ATDI listener, this album is awful. Having lost two of their members that they recorded "Acrobatic Tenement" with before this album, ATDI was at a low point, and it shows through musically. It sounds rough and incomplete, and much worse than "Acrobatic Tenement" and incredibly inferior to the following "in-CASINO-OUT." If you're obsessed with ATDI, or just like anything with a guitar, buy this album. Otherwise, buy their other four -- THOSE are excellent 
 I read the amazon reader reviews before I bought the book. Yet I must admit that I am a bit disappointed with the purchase. The principles in the book about dream making is nothing new at all. The book tries to relate a  concept of 'ease' with a life working towards your dream. But it is not  very convincing to me. And the 5-step process on finding your dream is a  typical method that can be found in many other self-help books 
 I have seen several films about Van Gogh, all which were fascinating.  In each Van Gogh was a character that was portrayed in a manner that was human and who had ideas and humanity as well as a need to do art.  By contrast, Harris' Pollock lacked any humanity, except for one scene where he takes a dog to a vet.  And Pollock didn't seem to be someone who thought about life at all.  He hardly cared about anyone and in the whole movie connected with no one with the exception of his wife, and that was far more a practical relationship than a love relationship.  His wife Lee was portrayed as a generally uninteresting person as well.  I was not drawn in by the film at all by any of the main characters.  Pollock's gift to the world was his art; who he was and the life he lived were not worth making a movie of if this is the best the story can be told in film.  
 This book is easy reading, chock full of anecdotal evidence from the arena of ultra-competitive triathletes.  And while it acknowledges that the reader is probably more of a casual athlete, the book offers little concrete advice.  Rather, Kearns prefers to let you go your own way, using overarching (vague) advice streams.  The main ideas in the book can be summed up rather neatly:  1) Train only for the enjoyment of reaching "peak performance."  The author calls this "pure motivation". 2) Aerobic training is the indispensible base for triathletes - anaerobic training must come second and be built upon the long-distance training you accumulate and maintain over time. 3) Rest adequately between "key workouts," the workouts that push your limits, are planned fluidly around your life, etc. 4) Gradually intensify workouts as you become more fit.  Do the workout that benefits you most.  One suggestion: the 100/10 "brick" (ie 50 miles biking followed by a 5 mile run).  There, I saved you $10.  This book is a GREAT mental guide for pursuing an enjoyable triathlon career but should be regarded as a companion to other books that can offer you more concrete information about training, especially if you're new to the sport 
 Study after study, it has been demonstrated that Asians have higher IQs than whites, lower crime rates than whites, and make better parents.  (For card-carrying members of the KKK: Don't take my word for it.  Go read "The Bell Curve" and Rushton's little book.)  Since many whites have used this book to bolster their white supremacist views against blacks and hispanics, it is only fair for whites to acknowledge Asian superiority, based on the conclusions of these very books.  Fair is fair, right 
 Very light weight, shallow coverage of a complex and interesting (for architectural photographers) subject.  The lighting diagrams are useful but in general the book does not provide much information or insight into the practice.   This is a coffee table book, sort of.  If you are interested in this corner of the photography world, try to find a used copy of Norman McGrath's now out of print "Photographing Buildings Inside and Out".  Norman is one of the grand masters of the craft and his book is the real thing, chock full of information.   If you are just starting out, I recommend Eric Roth's new book "Interior Photography: Lighting and Other Professioinal Techniques with Style".  Eric is a very successful Boston based architect/interiors photographer who writes clearly and is right on the mark about the basics of the business and the craft.   
 The author - not the subject.  Just a very strange book that requires a real will to finish 
 Even the world's greatest living military historian admits to being "mystified" by the Iraq war in his opening chapter.  The following chapters are more in the Keegan style and provide a solid background on Iraq and its place in the region.  Iraq did not provide the sustained episodes of combat that Mr. Keegan may be used to detailing, and hence his work is brought up significantly short, as there are no great tank or infantry battles for him to cover.  His analysis of the war's aftermath is brief and unsatisfactory, especially when that is where the real war began.  Mr. Keegan wrote about his subject too early in its history and the results leave the reader as equally mystified as the author.  Far more highly recommended would be Yossef Bodansky's "The Secret History of the Iraq War", David Zucchino's "Thunder Run", or "Generation Kill" by Evan Wright.   
 I purchased this book keeping in mind the depth of knowledge of Romila Thapar, but was extremely DISSAPOINTED.  The book completely underlights the Golden Period of India 800BC to 800AD and leaves off details like the discomfiture of Alexander (the Great :-0 ) and  many other really fantastic details that could have been included.  There is not much historic or literary value for this book.  Not th e right buy for studying the history of India 
 More of the same from that crowd whose volume and omnipresence belie their actual numbers. Yet another example of how dissent is being stifled by the evil Karl Rove and his minions! The amazing thing is that the only yappers Wolcott finds so contemptible are the ones with a conservative viewpoint. These are the only know-it-all pundits that have no business yapping, apparently. No mention of Chris Matthews, Air America, or Dan Rather--these are all crusading truthseekers i suppose. In any event, for all of you who are into this type of self-congratulatory, exclusive knowledge of how the United States has become a dictatorship by electing people that all these writers, singers, journalists, and otherwise pampered elites with bully pulpits don't like, I'd like to ask one question: Does this paranoid fantasy land that you and your faction have carved out for yourselves enrich your lives on any level whatsoever? To just blindly believe in cut-and-paste conspiracy theories so you can sleep easily knowing that the evil empire isn't fooling you? Man, you people should relax. Find a new obsession, because this one's irrelevant and just a shameful waste. History will ultimately tell us the full truth, but in the meantime, for a bunch of moral relativists you sure have gotten apocolyptic on us. Sheesh 
 I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$ 
 OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOps!!  Bill Cosby made the biggest mistake you can make when criticising the manneurisms and ingraned philosophy of a certain race.  Never, ever, for the love of God, ever criticize your own race.  Mr. Cosby, how on earth can anyone call you a racist if you belong to that race?  Calling someone a racist is the quickest way to shut up that person when he/she is making a legitimate argument.  It also prevents you from having to think about the problem.  Brilliant book Mr. Dyson.  I'm an American of latino descent.  I had planned on fixing some of the problems that are prevalent in the latino community, but then I'd have to criticize my own race, and then I'd be an upper class latino yuppie who wants every white person to like me, right?   An Oreo Cookie?  No, no, I think I'll do what Mr. Dyson would likely suggest that I do.  Sit on my butt, make a baby I can't afford to take care of and wave a latino flag; then when I get fired from my job, I'll just blame it on the white guy next door.  Bye bye personal responsibility, helloooooooooooooooo entitlements.  
 Granted, I'm not by any means a fan of space rock, but this is just awful.  I'm sure there is a fan base out there for the piercing synths and annoying lyrics, but it doesn't really sit well with me.  If you are looking for something different to listen to, as I was, bypass this one.  If you like this kind of music, hey, more power to you, but if you are unsure of space rock, don't start here 
 Very left anti-capitalism book. Contains no cogent arguments. Facts are skewed or are outright lies. Example: Page 56 states "The huge budget deficits during the Reagan years in the 1980s were due to tax cuts..." When , in fact, data from 'Budget of the United States Government: Historical Tables' show large increases in Government revenue during the years after the tax cuts. The increased deficits being due to large house/senate spending. Of course, in this book, Bill Clinton can do no wrong. Over all, this book is a very hard left leaning and biased work. I wish I could get my money back 
   Finkelstein is a one-sided advocate of the Palestinian Arab cause. For some reason he has not bothered in all his years of research to read the Palestinian or Arab press in regard to their intentions towards Israel. Because of this he totally ignores the unrelenting Arab ambition to destroy Israel, and the hate-filled Arab propaganda which is its fundamental note in relation to Israel. This means he gives no credibility whatsoever to the idea that Israel might possibly be engaging in certain military operations in order to, God forbid, defend itself.  . Finkelstein totally ignores Jewish victims of the conflict, and shows no human sympathy whatsoever. Without going into questions of his personal psychology or pathology, it is possible to simply see in his attitude a callousness toward Jewish suffering .  3. Finkelstein claims that supporters of Israel who he calls `philo- Semites' call anyone who criticizes Israel, `Anti-Semitic'. The absurdity of this remark should be apparent to anyone who has ever read an Israeli newspaper, or followed Israeli political discussion. In fact if Jews called anyone who criticizes Jews or Israel ` anti- Semitic' they then would be calling almost every Jew, `Anti-Semitic'. The distinction Finkelstein fails to make is in one sense simply that between constructive and destructive criticism. There are those who criticize Israel with the intention of helping it do better, and those who criticize Israel out of hate and with a desire to injure and even destroy it. Not simply the substance but the whole tone of Finkelstein's remarks put him in the latter category. And it should also be added that with the desire to injure comes the desire to insult and humiliate. This is in fact one of Finkelstein's major traits as writer and person. And one of the reasons he has lost several academic positions is because of his frequent personal abusing of students who had opinions that differed from his.  Finkelstein totally ignores the unremitting hate which has come from the Arab media for the past eight years. He ignores the violence of Arab society in general , and their having time and again initiated violence and war against Israel. His work is totally dishonest, and one- sided.   
 This movie is ridiculously inaccurate. Noah and his family get attacked by water pirates led by Lot who by the way wasn't alive till about 1000 years AFTER the flood. There's a water peddler as well-NOT IN THE BIBLE. Sodom and Gamorrah are destroyed which also doesn't happen for another 1000 years to which Lot has a big part. This "Lot" is a huge sinner, his wife is horrible and he has no daughters. God is portrayed as whimsical. Noah's son's aren't very godly either. It's inaccuracies and toying with the bible makes it worthy of kindling to start a fire. Don't bother watching it if you know the bible and love the Lord you will end up being disgusted too. Hollywood will do anything to ruin biblical movies. Stick to The Ten commandments, The Passion of the Christ, this one isn't worth 10 cents.. 
 This book basically contains the same doomsday predictions that were given to encourage discrimination against the Irish and the Chinese in the 1800s.  The predictions of certain doom never came true.  They won't this time.  After decades of unprecedented immigration, what have we?  We have a booming economy, the highest real per capita GDP in the history of the US and the 2nd highest in the world, a historically low rate of unemployment and productivity growing faster than even Greenspan imagined.  Just how are we suffering from this immigration?  Answer: we aren't.  As for the cultural effects, go to Honduras and see the larger cities peppered with McDonalds and Pizza Huts and see the young girls dressing like Britney Spears.  It's quite obvious that the rest of the world is more influenced by US culture than vice versa.  And as to the cultural effects, I say, "Bring it."  That's right.  Bring it.  Irish, bring your beer.  Italians, bring your reciptes.  Indians, bring your curry (but not so much).  Japanese, influence us with your work ethic and team work.  Germans, bring your engineering expertise.  All these cultures have enhanced American culture.  When the rhetoric is removed and the actual evidence is examined, it's clear that immigration has caused no damage to the USA.  On the contrary, it has made it a much better place 
 The premise put forth in the title is supported by some keen insights into "leadership by Calling" and comparisons to it with "modern leadership theory."  Les Csorba writes about the danger of pursuing results without compassion; a point with which I agree. Unfortunately, some of the examples he chooses are questionable...    After warning about the danger of weak character in powerful leaders, Csorba chastises German Chancellor Schroeder for turning back on some promises to George W Bush regarding the war on terrorism and then goes on to deride him for his four wives.  Meanwhile he praises Jack Welch for going from Neutron Jack to a gentler Jack (which Jack says he would abandon if needed)while still making the "tough" decisions that got the "results" for the shareholders.  Jack can change is mind and go back to compassionless results... OK.  Also, there is no mention that Jack was getting results with his personal secretary whilst the wife was at home...    Unfortunately the theme in Csorba's examples becomes one of bashing the mistakes of Democrats and forgiving the sins of the Republicans.  He does sprinkle in some condemnation for a few wrong-minded Republicans in a meek attempt at balance.  It's a shame that he turned this into a politcally tainted work.  It started off so well.    It started off well even though it will turn off readers who are not people of faith as faith is central precept to this book.  It also started off well even though he chose to make George W Bush the role model for how to be a trust-able leader.  Unfortunately this conservative/political bent turned an even harder right from there and kept going.  It kept going to the point that I could no longer plan on sharing this book with some folks I know who really need it. They would simply say its a Bush-ie/right-winger book and dismiss the valuable and otherwise soundly argued premise.  Too bad.  Csorba almost had a classic instead of a politically tainted leadership manual.  I say this even though I am Republican, am one of the few folks who would admit they were voting for Bush BEFORE the election, am a person of faith, and tend to find the Dems an easy target.  But this book was supposed to be about so much more than Republican politics.  Too bad 
 On a +ve note the book presents one view of the SOX Act that all senior persons involved in Corporate Governance should be aware of. IT Professional must be aware of this act, as it does impose stringent information requirements and controls on your systems deployed in the production environment. Recommend that you look at exhibit 11.1 (P108)/ exhibit 11.2 (P111) quite useful.   On a -ve note - After the first 100 pages (some what padded out) It was my opinion that Information Technology Professionals will not gain any true value from reading this book. However, as I continued I did find some useful snippets of useful information- However not enough for me to gain true value.   There are some good quotes in the book, but lacks the essence of the Systems view to which it aims targets in its title - certain parts of the book confused me e.g. Exhibit 1.1 (P27). In the monitoring section P56 - The author missed the opportunity to discuss the monitoring of internal systems messages within the enterprise. Exhibit 2.1 (P44) is repeated as Exhibit 6.1 (P76) with no real value added On P77 the Author states that XML, middleware , Java will be a success factor - This as a general statement is wrong.  But hey thats my opinion ... 
 I'm rather upset with the technical quality of this DVD.  Grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000, without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade.  This is certainly not worth the $20+ dollar price tag Amazon.com has right now 
 Alright first of all anyone that only mentions Satellite Years in their comparisons to this cd should sit down.  Second of all anyone that says "people don't like it because their is no screaming", you can also sit down.  The fact is A-Types does not even compare to any of their three previous releases in any way at all.  For those kids that think Satellite Years is their best cd, listen to Frailty of Words which is probably one of the best cds, if not the best in this genre.  This cd is perfection.  The tracks on that cd and some on Satellite Years have a perfect flow, whether there is screaming or singing.  A-Types on the other hand just gets flat out boring.  The singing on the cd is fine, but the guitarwork and drums just fail.  Don't get me wrong there still is some nice guitar work in tracks such as Breathe From a Coma which i do enjoy still, but if you compare any track from this cd to any old track, with or without vocals, it just doesn't compare.  Now the music is just typical and boring when before they could take you from the heaviest breakdown to the most mellow interlude.  They used to end songs with four minute interludes and you can just lose yourself in the beauty of how they are constructed.  Listen to End of an Era or The Far Pavillions.  If you don't enjoy screaming just keep listening to these songs until they get about halfway done and all of a sudden these interludes hit you.  Even in "Frailty of Words" they have many tracks that include singing such as "Endeavor".  This track is very heavy and then comes to a beautiful singing part that just blows you away.  They constructed songs to perfection, including everthing possible and constantly changed everything, whereas now you hear repeated chorus' and many repetitive riffs.  It is almost not even possible to compare this to anything that hopesfall has ever written.  I know that they lost their guitarist and only have one original member, but how can they possibly try to live on as the same band.  They have not matured, they have not sold out, they just have died.  This cd just goes on and bores beyond belief and I cannot bring myself to understand how people say that it gets better by listen.  The repetitive chorus' get worse everytime i hear them.  It is pathetic when you hear the same line in a song about 7 times.  "Woah Icarus temping fate again.."  How many times does it need to be said so that the fans can all sing along.  The old Hopesfall had no specific structure at all.  It was pure chaos and then pure calmness and then sometimes they would even bring you back into the chaos before they ended the song.  I enjoy when bands change styles or when bands have less screaming sometimes because i can appreciate that they are trying to move on as musicians, but once you get rid of originality that you once had, that's when you lose.  I wish i could feel good about their change, but the cd is just flat out boring and does not keep it's originality.  As one of the reviewers said before, if you want to hear a band that makes a great change and matures into a more rock type music listen to "In Response" by This Day Forward.  They got rid of almost all of the screaming and it still is original.  This is what Hopesfall seems to be trying to do, but they fail miserably.  I still love Hopesfall, as they are my favorite band and I believe that the songs on the first three cds are some of the best songs ever, but this cd just even without comparison to those cds, is just boring and unoriginal.  I just wish i could have seen them before they put out this cd, or even before they put out Satellite Years because their old stuff was so original.  I will give it two stars because "It Happens" and "Breathe From a Coma" are decent tracks that are not that boring but as for the rest of the cd i would not recommend it.  Check out "In Response", if you want to see a band progress you won't be dissapointed.  As for Trustkill it is ashame that they had such great bands and let it go to waste and now they are one of the worst labels.  And if you want to hear good Hopesfall purchase "No Wings To Speak Of" because it is the best cd ever made in this genre of music.  
 This DVD's 40-minute program covers the very basics of newborn care.  Please note that the content is on caring for a newborn; if your baby is already a few weeks old, you most likely won't need this as you won't be able to learn anything new.  The DVD is divided into over a dozen chapters.  Each cheapter is very short, with a nurse (or is she a midwife?) demonstrating newborn care techniques, such as feeding, swadding, dressing, etc.  She never explains in detail some of the intricacies in caring for a baby.  For example, if a baby cries her heart out during diaper change, what should a parent do?  In the end, this title feels incomplete and unsatisfactory.  The "bonus" chapter on baby gear is a complete joke, with the model quickly running through a list of things while pointing her right hand at each in the same way.  Really annoying.  I would not recommend this video at all unless you are (like I was) completely clueless.  Even then, you can find this at your local library or on Netflix 
 Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
 My parents gave this book to me when I was a kid because I was a "late bloomer".  I really think that was the beginning of my self esteem issues.  I was unaware that I was a "late bloomer" until they pointed it out to me by giving me the book.  I can remember being so sad reading it and thinking there was something wrong with me.  Now that my daughter is a bit of a late bloomer, it's gotten me thinking about this book.  Please don't buy it for your kid.  If you do, please explain to them why you're giving it to them.  Don't leave it to them to draw their own conclusions that they are like Leo they can't do anything right 
 I've read both the book and the reviews, and it's funny how saving the children is the "it's not my fault" finger-pointing device du jour.   I don't purport to be a cross-section of America, but I have no problems getting my toddlers out of a grocery store without their Sponge-Bob cereal (my wife is a different story...she loves the stuff) and can drive by a McDonalds while ignoring the shrieks of "we want a happy meal!"     However, I am overweight.   I don't blame Kraft or McDonalds (although I wouldn't mind getting in on that cash cow once the lawsuits hit), I can perfectly well on my own decide to down the entire bag of Oreos without a 30-second ad telling me to.    Mr. Brownell's anecdotal descriptions of the effects of advertising on obesity do not create any link.   As a matter of fact (forget citation of study...but could look it up if anyone wants it) the amount of calories consumed by the average person has increased about 1% over the last 20 years, while the obesity rate has soared.   So...somehow the food industry has been plotting against my children by adding 400% more calories into that 1%?   It doesn't make sense, as do most of the arguments in the book.   
 Have you ever read a book that just seemed to drag on and on?  For me, that was this book.  If you like fantasy then you might like this, because that is the genre of this book.  It is about a Jewish girl named Hannah.  She goes to a family party and hears a knock on the door.  She opens it and then sort of wakes up and she thought it was a dream.  She now has a new name, Chaya.  She now has to figure out what happened, and what she will do in this body.  It takes place in New Rochelle.  It is old times.  It doesn't give a specific time but you can infer by the clues and setting.  She doesn't know why this happened to her but she must try to fix it. 	I didn't like this book at all.  I thought it was really hard to follow.  You have to pay attention throughout the whole book.  You can never daydream or you won't know why they are calling her a new name.  This was definitely made for older adults, or people with a higher reading level.  If you are a good reader and you like to challenge yourself, try this book.  I don't recommend this book if you are younger, or just not that well of a reader.  This is for very and I mean very good and high level readers.  I would say between the ages of 25-60 might like this book.  I don't think this book was a page turner.  I wanted to put it down, instead of not wanting to put it down.  It never sparked my interest.  Her being Jewish, and the book being a fantasy, I couldn't relate to anything that happened.  This book was hard to concentrate on.  If you look up for one second, you miss most of the story, so concentrate hard.  I couldn't relate to anyone. I am not Jewish.  If you are Jewish, you might actually understand this book better than I could.  I didn't like the genre.  It was all fake and totally unrealistic.  If you like that sort of stuff, then read this book, but I don't like fantasy.  I didn't like how it was written.  It was too hard to concentrate on.  I had to reread twice to find out why they are calling her a different name.  I never found any surprised in the story.  I could guess what would happen next.  It was predictable.  None of the chapters had cliffhangers.  If just was boring and that's it.  I thought it was extremely boring.  I didn't understand anything and I would rather do my homework, than read that book.  My mind wandered a lot.  I had to read sections over and over again.  I never believed the plot one bit.  With the story being fantasy, everything is farfetched.  I think older people would enjoy this book, because they would be the only ones who could understand it.   
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 It may say "Slow Cooker" on the front of the item, but I assure you, it is anything but slow! I was looking for a crock pot for camping using propane and was told this was the item for me!   So, I made my Hungarian Ghoulash in it, glad that the night meal would be done in 8-10 hours when we got back from the beach. All I can say is, thank goodness my husband noticed that it was bubbling inside of the cooker a half hour later, or we wouldn't have had anything but charcoal left, had we left the campsite that day without checking it! It was cooking on low, and it was literally done in a half hour's time. So, keep in mind, if you are camping and you haven't tried using this product yet, it won't take long before your meal is done.   Sadly, my crock pot recipes were put away for the rest of that trip- the campground we were at didn't have electricity, hence why I wanted a propane crock pot. 
 Much of the material tracing the earlier history of Jerusalem is well written and quite interesting. However, when the author approaches the re-emergence of a strong Jewish presence in Jerusalem all of her previous objectivity goes out the window as she argues that the Jews brutalize the Arabs and that things would be so much better if only the Jewish majority were ruled by the Arab minority.  Her portrait of Jerusalem as a divided and armed camp on p. 419, "Repeatedly ...." is simply false. It is true that the area of Jaffa Road and King George is no longer mixed, but the commercial interaction between Arabs and Jews has simply moved to Talpiot. You also see many clearly identifiable Arabs at the three campuses of the Hebrew University and both Hadassah hospitals. The remaining area of commercial activity in Jerusalem is the food industry where in restaurants, hotels and grocery stores you see Arabs running the kitchens in most restaurants and running a large part of the operations of many of the grocery stores. I see this every day living here in Jerusalem.   The idea that Jews buying properties and moving into Arab neighborhoods constitutes an act of war has its parallels in the history of black people in the old south. It is a view of someone who rejects the idea that Jewish people are equal with any other people. How sad that the author has wasted her talents to present such a view 
 This book is practically useless.  The instructions it gives are so vauge and obvious it must think you are an idiot.  I wont say its completely useless,  with 1001 entries I'm sure you can find a couple of pieces of usefull information in the massively thick and heavy book. 98% of its entries are uninformative, and vauge descriptions of what you either already knew or could easily figure out. I wouldn't wish this book on my worst enemy.  Oh wait my in laws bought it for me for my birthday, Makes sense huh? ;)  Seriously though, I have to wonder if the people who rated this book highly really use it? And if so what do they use it for? I'd like to know. 
 Darryl Worley's "Have You Forgotten" begs another, more relevant question -- "Do You Read the Paper." Despite the fact that Hussein's Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, he justifies our illegal invasion and occupation of that sovereign nation with references to the Twin Towers. To xenophobes like Worley, the Middle East is just one big nation of indistinguishable brown people. He justifies our warmaking with cliched references to "our freedom," apparently oblivious to the irony that the Patriot Act -- passed in reaction to 9/11 -- has effectively cancelled the Bill of Rights. He accepts the Official Version of 9/11, despite the fact that the story has holes big enough to fly an airplane through. I've heard some pretty reactionary stuff on country radio before, but this song definitely takes the cake. 
 Ok, the Greg Duli thing has gone on way to long.  Is it me or does every song he writes/sings sound the same?  He has not sung a decent song since his "Helen Highwater" days...and even then it was all cover songs.  The songs in "She Loves You" remind me of a "Warhol" painting.  It's basicly a product (like Cambell's Soup) that you seen over and over in print or illustrations, then he blasts music on top of a sub-par voice and calls it a masterpiece.  I assume that's why he moved to Cali as they are so "culture starved" he can pass it off as art.    He talks of his pain and draws from his experiences of life.  I can remember Duli running home crying because the braces on his teeth came loose while sled riding.  I am sure soon we shall see a song called "Trauma in the snow on the river bank", read interviews in trade rags on how it "changed him so", and see pictures of him in the snow...with a smoke in hand of cours!   I understand that he has found a following of lost souls such as his, reaching for some truth to this life...all waiting for him to unvail some beautiful reasoning to "it all."  Unfortunately, he's just a guy from Sharon Park in Hamilton, Ohio, singing for a buck and trying to make you believe he's something other than what he really is.  Admittedly, this sometimes works, as it did for Charles Manson (not comparing the men, only their methods).  But then again, what do I know...I only buy music. 
 Suddenly, everyone is condemning America. Rock 'n Rollers, writers, artists, actors and actresses, foreign dignitaries. They're all pointing their finely manicured fingers at us "vulgar" Americans warning us about our "decadent" lifestyles and "hegemony." We're too fat, too materialistic, too self-centered, too violent, too pushy, they decry. And this, they insist, is why the world hates us. But first it warrants asking: are all theses stereotypes true? Are we Americans really that horrible? Where are the facts to prove it?  Leftist author Mark Hertsgaard in his book "The Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World" doesn't attempt to answer these questions. Instead, his aim is to perpetuate the anti-American stereotype, to exonerate and explain away those who hate us. One of the most mind-boggling parts of Hertsgaard's book is when he attempts to extol African culture over American culture (which part of that vast continent he extols he does not make clear). The Africans, he insists, lead a far more relaxed, casual lifestyle than our own frenzied one. Americans are too greedy and pushy and violent. If only we could be more like the Africans, the world would love us, and peace would reign over the land.  Statistics show, however, that Americans are rather laid-back, moreso than even those precious Europeans. The Swiss, for example, are more concerned with time than the average American. And as far as being violent, once again statistics show that Americans are less violent than even the saintly Canadians. But the Left never allows for facts and figures to interfere with its arguments. So instead, Hertsgaard praises Africa's primitive ways, which, to him, are more idyllic. Once again ignoring data, he fails to acknowledge Africa's AIDS crisis, genocide, female mutilation, mass starvation, tyranny, ethnic warfare and average lifespan of about 46 years.     Leftists like Hertsgaard who bash America on all levels while praising the most war-torn, impoverished societies on earth make clear their intentions. The world, Hertsgaard argues, should not rest until America is brought down to its level. In Hertsgaard's religion of socialism, America is the devil, and anyone who hates the devil is level-headed and rational. If only we stupid Americans would wake up, and realize how much better off we'd be if we succumb to the world's hatred and allow ourselves to lead the lives of those innocent Africans, with their baskets on top their heads, quaint huts made of straw, and their machetes, tyrants, starvation, and early death... 
 This book wasn't the best offering I have ever had.  It was very poorly written and hard to understand.  This fact is proven when they are discussing the city roads and you can't follow a thing. On the other hand there is a load of information, but it is not worth it.  I only got through have the book.  It was incredibly hard to follow, and there were little explanations for the things that happened.  It included information that was never neccesary.  This book isn't worth picking up.  Unfortunately there aren't many othr books on the case 
 Fiona Range is a good book for someone who does not know good literature. There are so many typos that it is distracting to someone who knows how to use grammar. Tbe plot is too simplisitic for a book this long--maybe better suited to a novella or a short-story. Also, the characters, excepting for Fiona, were very shallow and needed more purpose. Considering that the author has written much more enjoyable novels previous to this--it leaves the reader with the sense that it was intended as a money-maker, not a heart-warmer 
 this is perhaps the worst read I have experienced in a long time in fiction as an art form.  Yet, sadly the misuse of the fiction form was dressed up as an attempt at human rights activism.  And even so, one wonders why this author is doing it, in this form, with this substance, at this juncture.  While the plights of ethnic montagnards in Southeast Asia are both a touchy subject and a worthy cause, this book seems to take this issue back to more than 30 years ago, thereby distracting our attention by diverting it from the present time to the past.  What we need to look at is their plights now, not what their plights were decades ago, in a context of a war that has become jaded with too much talk and not much understanding.  What do we learn, if anything at all, from this book regarding the plights of these forgotten people?  But what bothers me deeply is the obvious fact that the supposedly "deep" novel reads like a jungle one is forced to travel -- the "novel" defies every good sense about fiction as an art form -- the basics of gbood writinng -- character development, plot, movement, climax, showing-not-telling, etc.etc.etc. are all disregarded.  No wonder this book is a self-publishing endeavor...The fact that it allegedly on some prize decades ago in a war-torn country adds to the mystification as to how literature was judged at such time, in such place...And then there is the issue of the translation -- very good in some parts, quite naive and jaded in others... One is lost in trying to assess the art form and the worthy cause it allegedly carries -- is it a problem with translation, or is it a problem with this writer not knowing how to write fiction and taking too much of an effort at self-importance?  What I would even venture to say:  a matter of disingenuous intent?  I glanced at the previous reviews -- didn't help me a bit.  Everybody seemed to be from some same camp with the author -- People also seemed to be talking about the plights of the forgotten people of the mountains rather than the novelistic art, or the book itself...A very worthy cause indeed, but does this book do any justice to it, or does this book simply attempt to elevate itself by using the worthy cause to make up for its obvious short-comings in the matter of the art, and the craft, of writing?      
 I'd write a review for this sewage, but Kevin did it so perfectly that I'd be wasting my time. The only decent one of these bunch of horrible adaptations was Silent Hill, and even that one lacked the greatness of the video game. And now, there's a Spyhunter movie coming out? WTF is next? Prince of Persia (...please don't do that one, I was only kidding!)?  Get the video games for the real thing 
 Politically Incorrect apparently means bigoted, racist, sexist, classist, and freakin' proud of it, woman!  These "guides" are a scary, scary joke written by angry bigots to make open-minded people angry, and to help justify their own prejudices and inablity to let go of the "good old days" when it was considered fitting when a woman got slapped for mouthing off...    What a disgusting view of the world 
 I have listened to this cd and I disagree with many of the reviewers of this cd. I do not think this cd is good. It is not an easy listen because their are too many vocalists. I have been a fan of Journey since I first saw them in 1978 and own all of their cds. This cd will be filed and probably never played again. I saw Journey open up for Def Leppard this year and I was dissappoined by the songs they played on this tour. I would not recommend this cd but if you want to hear Journey at their best check out Infinity or Captured. Another good buy are the two Journey DVDs, "Greatest Hits 1978 - 1997" and "Live In Houston 1981". 
 Didnt think this cd was as varied or good as the previous two which is a bit disappointing 
 There were a few interesting nuggets of information in this book, but there were miles of reading between them.  The first part of the book is an exercize of retelling you how great this book is going to be and how it will change your business life.  The rest of the book is a smattering of pedestrian marketing information repackaged to sound like astonishing breakthroughs in thinking.  Yes, I understand the components of selling three ways.  Yes, I get it.  What a waste of time and money 
 I had read a book about the French and Indian war, one about the revolution and also the recent best seller,1776.  I found The War That Forged a Nation an excellant addition to my understanding of this important period in American history.  I would highly recommend it.  Very readable 
 ... and the maps are worthless.    Two examples of the many glaring inaccuracies contained in this book: 1) Rick claims you can pick up a bus map in any tourist information kiosk.  The following is an actual transcript of our conversation with the tourist info lady: us: buon giorno.  do you speak english? info lady: of course. us: we'd like to go to Vatican city.  may we have a bus map please? info lady: a bus map? for Roma? us: um, yes. info lady: no such thing exists.  2) Rick claims you can see everything you want to see in the Vatican in one morning: St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican Museums, the Sistine Chapel - everything. Um, Rick? Have you ever BEEN there? Did you notice the 40,000 other people there all trying to get in to the same things? Did you notice the priceless and beautiful works of art on practically every surface?  Did it occur to you that people might, perhaps, want to stop and admire a large number of them? Light a candle? Say a prayer? Some of us, also, have to behind a crowd of 35 elderly Germans to look at Michaelangelo's Pieta, and everything else.  Methinks ol' Rick either spends an average of 15 minutes apiece on the most astonishing and pleasurable spots in Rome, or is comfortable elbowing foreign senior citizens in the ribs 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 Contrary to popular opinion on this website, I found this book to be boring, repetitive and badly written. It was so boring I struggled to finish it during a journey where I had little else to do. This book summarizes a few events that were significant to Intel and offers advice on how similar business changes should be handled. Being an engineer, and not a manager, I found this to be vague and rambling. However I do agree with the book's title - Only the Paranoid survive. I think this outlook is useful for everyone, and not just business types 
 I love math and I love cars, so I was looking forward to a concise book on the topics.  Within reading the first few pages, I found several mistakes.  Some were simple mathematical mistakes in converting and others were more serious assumptions about vehicles and others were just due to poor editing, eg. diagrams that were unclear or stating that "9/12" converts inches to feet.  These first few pages were enough to prove the book shouldn't be taken seriously.  There are still some decent formulas and ideas if you keep your eyes open and know enough to catch the rest of it 
 I have used this book only when I need thermodynamic, physical or chemical data. However the other sections of this book are not practical at all, for those who can read and apply from pure math this is the one; for those looking for practical applications using the information given by this book, sorry fellas this is not the place for it 
 I am a fan of blues and roots music who bought this album based on its interesting set list of classic songs and its rave reviews from various sources. Unfortunately, I found the album way overproduced. There is too much bland orchestra, chorus, and strings that smother the life of the songs. A few good tracks are exceptions: "Fess Up" is an affectionate solo piano tribute to Professor Longhair, "Cabbage Head" has amusing lyrics and a smaller combo that doesn't overload the sound, and "I'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal You" has some good moments where you hear the interplay of individual instruments. But overall I would recommend this album only if you love Dr. John's voice and want to hear what he does with these classic songs. If you love his piano, go for the solo "Dr. John Plays Mac Rebannack." If you want to hear New Orleans blues played with great piano, vocals, and backup band, buy "Crawfish Fiesta" by Professor Longhair. To my ears, "Goin' Back to New Orleans" is overrated 
 Now I'd actually give this movie 3.5 stars. But since so many people talk about being one of the greatest movies ever made I'm giving it a 1. The story was quite good in how it dealt with the American Dream and how a dysfunctional a family can be behind a seemingly perfect house. Kevin Spacey gave an excellent comedic performance as Lester Burnham, the one with the midlife crisis. Annette Benning's character Carolyne is Lester's obsessive-compulsive perfectionist wife who's role tells us the consequences of giving more importance to material things over family. But there were parts in the film which didn't make much sense. What's with Janie showing her breasts through the window at Ricky? How come Ricky stood naked in front of her during a conversation? There was no need for that. A girl her age especially would freak if a guy stood naked in front of her like that. But she seemed perfectly fine with it. Also Ricky's point about the plastic bag he filmed having beauty in how it freely danced in the wind is just another pathetic attempt at being artistic. This is apparently just another arthouse film that critics praise, making it seem better than it really is. Frankly it was also very dull and depressing. 
 This book by Stan Larson does present an interesting story of Ferguson, a lawyer who had a hobby in archaeology. However, Ferguson was nothing more than that - a hobbyist in archaeology. Indeed, his historical and archaeological method would make many of those trained in these areas blush. Indeed, his cointribution to the Book of Mormon was minimal, if any, even when he did write favourably for its antiquity, such as the errant books, full of errata, he did with Bruce Warren.  The real "meat" of the book lies in the so-called archaeological tests for the Book of Mormon. However, Ferguson's tests are often times ignorant of the Book of Mormon, are contradicted by modern scholarship, and even ethnocentric. FOr example, bellows are mentioned as an anachronism in the Book of Mormon. However, bellows are only mentioned in an Old World context, not a New World context, in Bountiful (probably Wadi Sayq in Oman) in 1 Nephi 17. Bellows have been found in areas in the Old World pre-dating the Book of Mormon volume, so any charge of such representing an anachronism is a non sequitur.  Furthermore, "grapes" are mentioned as an anachronism. However, types of grapes have been known to be native to ancient Mesoamerica, as botanists have noted, and are referred to as "vitis." Again, the mention of grapes in the Book of Mormon is errant.  Much more could be said about the mistakes contained in this text. I would suggest one to read John L Sorenson, "An ancient American setting for the Book of Mormon" (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Books, 1985), as it deals well with the issue of Book of Mormon material culture, and in an even more scholarly manner than Larson does in this text, as did Ferguson who he cites.  I welcome sincere feedback at Robert.S.Boylan@nuim.i 
 The content of this book is very informative and helpful.  It focuses on specific rules of many poker variations and some statistics to go with them.  There is no shortage of calculated odds tables in this book for you to try to memorize.   However, John Scarne needs to get his money at the poker tables because his writing struggles.  You will not be fond of this man after your first 15 minutes of reading.  To get through this book, you must have alot of determination; you will not be reading it for fun.  Perhaps the toughest, most boring read of my life.   In my opinion, any improvement on your poker game is not worth the pain of reading this book.  There are other great books that will teach you far more efficiently 
 better. It helps you understand why you feel they way you do and how to think and feel better. 
 This so-called Companion to Virgil offers little to students of the poet, and certainly nothing to general or curious readers.  Very plainly, this volume is completely animated with theory--theories which are neither just to Virgil nor compatible to the Virgilian tradition.  This "companion" is ultra-modern in approach, so it is anachronistic in effect.  Virgil, his devotees, his commentators, his imitators, and his worthy translators, would not comprehend, nor desire to comprehend, the methods strewn through the pages of this volume.  Read Virgil in isolation from this book, and with the reverence that is his due; and if this is not sufficient, then seek the guidance of the ancients or that of their successors, the Humanists 
 With the publication this fall of Koen's Dark Angels, I looked forward to reading the book that started it all, Through A Glass Darkly.  While this book is a fast, easy read, I didn't see what a lot of the other reviewers saw in this book.  Not that it isn't entertaining.  TAGD is a historical romance, but when comparing Koen to writers such as Phillipa Gregory and even Jean Plaidy, Koen's book seems transparent and fluffy.  Her characters are somewhat unsympathetic and seem to lack basic common sense at times.  Its hard to like anybody in this book as many of the characters seem to fall into stereotypes, i.e. the wronged woman, the doting matriarch, the wicked mother.  Also, some of the plot twists are so obvious in coming, i.e. "one man's dark secret."  Yes, the book is a fun beach read type of work.  But, don't be disappointed if you come to this book and realize that it just doesn't have the emotional connectivity to character like other books, such as The Constant Princess or The Other Boleyn Girl. Read it for the intrigues, like an episode of Dynasty, but don't expect to come away feeling for the main character 
 True, there are many controversies raging about copying DVDs and copyrights. I suspect we are in a transition zone with all this and "the industry" will figure out how to help people love and cherish their DVDs rather than simply calling everyone a pirate. Having said that, I can also understand why an author of such a book wouldn't want to "say too much" about this controversy, especially if he his looking over his shoulder at "the lawyers." I was trying to think of an analogy to express my disapointment in this book (and this isn't a good one) but it goes like this: You want to go to Israel and you buy a book on "Israel for Dummies" and you search for something, anything on the controversy of the wall they are building. But instead of finding a discussion of the controversy you find a few off-handed quips about "There's a wall going up and it's causing some controversy. 'Nuff said."  "'Nuff said"? Hel-lo? Were dummies out here, that's why we bought the dumb book!  There might be some useful information for some people, but I was sorely disappointed 
 What a waste of time. This book is so boring and monotonous.  If I read one more time, how Jerry Frey used his "20 years of experience to make the decision" - I will hurl.  Where is the insight?   Where is the  original thinking?  How about some depth?  Please save your money 
 This book has many recipes that I can't ever see using.  Many are meals to share with your dog.  I'm uncomfortable with that.  The cookie recipes are OK, but not terrific, like I'd expected 
 I just spent the afternoon reading this after feeling mesmerized by the first one, Mote.  It was terribly disappointing.  OK, perhaps not a pure commercial potboiler, but vastly inferior to the mysteries and utter fascination within the first one.  In this, you know the problem:  the aliens, by their biology of uncontrolled population increase, are a terrible threat to mankind.  But ah, humans have been able to experiment with some of them for decades; the deus ex machina solution that emerges after some spectacular fighting is, to say the least, a letdown.  Everything else is needless detail.  That makes this a profound scifi dud, lacking the magic of the original.  Not recommended, except for uncritical cultists 
 On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the illustrious Ms. Cornwell?  Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly.  However, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  For such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans throughout.  Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ."  Are you kidding me?  The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must WORK in one of the houses.  The author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy.  Read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.   DY 
 La Pucelle is not well served here. This is a pretty mediocre, superficial treatment of Joan's life. Gordon brings a novelist's flair to what amounts to a somewhat stream-of-consciousness extended essay. Gordon likes Shaw's play, SAINT JOAN, and you can see how Shaw's view of Joan's voices/religious identity clearly shaped Gordon's perspective. Stick with Regine Pernoud's various books on Joan, which are superior in every aspect to this flawed offering 
 The DocuPen holds, at a maximum, 10 pages.  When I called customer service about this, I was told that the unit's capacity was being exceeded because I was scanning "high resolution images."  Photos?  No.  Pictures?  No.  I was scanning printed pages from books.  Apparently the DocuPen can only hold around 10 pages of normal text.  The 50 page limit described in their advertising apparently refers to pages with a sentence or 2 on them, rather than actual pages in books or journals--very odd considering it's touted as a tool for students.  A complete waste of time and money.  I returned it and now I'm back to using the photocopier.  Don't bother with this one, it's not at all what they claim 
 Mexican food is absolutely sacred to me, and this book is a profanation.  I bought it after spending a year in mexico and wanting to recapture some of the tastes i came to love so much.  it was a big dissapointment.  I can understand how it might be a neat story that she went there not knowing spanish but that she still learned how to cook some things... however, her "outsiders perspective" comes across as irritating ignorance.  her methods are anecdotal (as oppossed to researched) and in her recipes and stories she manages to miss both the grace of high class mexican cuisine and the flair of mexicos bountiful street food culture.  diana kennedy and rick bayless (to name the two most famous) both have books in english that are more thoughtful and authoritative.  even a quick glance at one of these far superior books will expose ortiz's attempt as the exercise in vain superfulousness that it is 
 Ms. Jones is delusional thinking Jesus was a capitalist (remember the story about Jesus driving the money changers out of the Temple).  I expect her next venture will be to sell snake oil.  Instead of wasting your money on this book, why not buy a good book on astrology or the bible and skip this hallucinogenic translation 
  Wealthy socialite and, as we later learn, brilliant surgeon Dr. Royce Lee (Elissa Landi) schleps 10,000 miles to the Philippines to rendezvous with, and marry, Dr. Jan Stockman (Otto Krueger), a pleasant (albeit a tad absent minded and disorganized) jungle doctor.  Ominously, CORREGIDOR, a movie named for an island that was the site of a crushing Allied defeat at the hands of the Japanese in 1942, begins its existence as a Somerset Maugham-ish White-Tie Love in the Mango Fields type love story.  Anyway, even though Dr. Royce sent an explanatory letter four months ago, the news of the wedding still comes as a bit of a (not disagreeable) shock to Dr. Jan.     No sooner are the nuptials joined then a squadron of Japanese planes darken the air and proceed to make hash out of the doctors' jungle home, wiping out the wedding guests in the process.  It's at this point that CORREGIDOR makes it first uneasy transition into action movie mode.  The courageous newlyweds begin the six-hundred mile trek to Manila, hiking through jungle sets and bushy back lots, avoiding the Enemy as best they can, until finally stumbling upon a small unit of American infantrymen.  A half-dozen or so Enemy enter stage right, half-heartedly fire at the Heroes.  The Heroes fire back and saunter off, if that's not too energetic a word for it, and somehow lose their pursuers.  The movie will go on to squander the rest of its miserable existence alternating melodramatic and overly complicated romantic subplots (there's a Dr. Michael at Corregidor...) with static and awkwardly staged action sequences.  About the only consistent quality in this movie is its lack of continuity.   One saving grace of CORREGIDOR is its willingness, verging on mania, to kill off most of its annoying secondary players.  Unfortunately, it kills off one at the end of act two only to have Dr. Royce hand a baby off to her in the middle of act three.  Not to be outdone by its melodramatic half, the action sequences also shown a strong aversion to keeping things straight.  An Enemy monoplane fighter is fatally shot but it's a biplane that plummets to earth.  To be fair, the movie was released in spring of 1943, about nine months after the real article surrendered.  That's a short incubation period for a movie, which may explain, if not excuse, some of its more glaring flaws.  This is a pep rally movie, and it gave the viewing public a chance to see one rousing infantry charge (complete with Battle Hymn of the Republic underscoring), the Enemy in disreputable retreat, and a stern scene of American defiance in defeat.     Still, CORREGIDOR is a bad movie, and whatever emotional charge it once carried dissipated long ago.  The actors are much better than the material, especially Otto Krueger.  I don't recall seeing him in anything else, but he combines the unpretentious amiability of a Jimmy Stewart with the melancholy detachment of a Leslie Howard.  Krueger doesn't have their charisma or star power, but his good performance is wasted in this one.   Fans of war movies may find CORREGIDOR moderately interesting.    
 Some decent stuff, but he barely mentions ETFs, which are becoming a bigger piece of the asset puzzle. And his cavalier negativity of index funds (also mentioned in his prior books) is incorrect.  He needs to read the Arnott study in the Journal of Portfolio Management (26, no. 4, 2000). However, his points on diversification and rebalancing are on target 
 Maybe I am just naughty, but there is really nothing new here.  I could have written a better book.  On the other hand, it was nice to see that I know what I am doing without having to read it in a book.  :)  I guess if you have no passion and no animal instint, get the book.  
 Tihs Album is not all that good when it came out in still not good till this day. I like all his other albums better I don't Know why he decided to release this crap.But the only song I really Like is hip hip qurtables 
 As a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed City of the Living Dead and Zombie, I was very disappointed with House by the Cemetery. Fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two-thirds of the movie, only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes.  House By the Cemetery is about an researcher (whose work is never specified) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in Massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress. The titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment, so Dr. Boyle, his wife Lucy and their son Bob move in despite a lot of bad signs, like the boarded-up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a Dr. Jacob Tess Freudstein in the front hall. Bob has little red-headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is (though no one else sees her). Furthermore, people keep claiming Dr. Boyle has been in town before with a non-existent daughter (which he denies, not totally convincingly). He also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter, Anne, who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night. And Lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues.   Got that? Good, because half of that stuff never gets explained. The only things that get worked out are the little red-headed girl's identity and the identity of the killer (neither of which are that hard to figure out). There are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film (the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand, the photograph that changes with each viewing, a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding) but Fulci's ability to handle the gore moments disappoints. He lingers too long over some deaths, makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter's head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary. Compared to the injury to the eye scene in Zombie or Christopher George chopping through the coffin in CotLD, Dr. Boyle's chopping through the door around his son's head feels like self-parody.  Fulci's other films have incoherent plots , but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot (the dream-like nature of City of the Living Dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat) and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic. House by the Cemetery has neither thing working in its favor. It's not Hell of the Living Dead-level bad, but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting (especially Paolo Malco, who plays Dr. Boyle) and an interesting set-up almost make the flaws worse.  Also, this version has a "never before seen deleted scene", but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack 
 Aren't these the same guys who were quoted in AdWeek or Ad Age or somewhere like that blithely confessing that all the predictions made in their first book were wrong?  Maybe not, but I seem to recall.  So, they  said, just throw the first book out and buy their new book instead.  Come  on.  Visionary, smisionary.  More hypotheticals and made-up stuff.  If you  want to be provoked, Faith Popcorn is about as much of this kind of fluff  as you need 
 213 has always been revered as the West Coast super-group that the public never got to hear. But the demo tapes and leaked basement sessions were always a tease to the fans of the braidless Snoop Dogg, the DJ Warren G, and the pre-fedora Nate Dogg. For the last five years, each of the aforementioned has promised this album on a list of different labels, different title and different themes. What it boiled down to was Snoop, Nate and Warren finding themselves with some spare time on their hands. The Hard Way portrays a crew of artists in search of the creative vigor they had a dozen plus years ago as the original 213.   Warren G has trademarked himself as the laid back MC. From hits like "This DJ", to the more recent, "I Want it All", he's never been expected to raise his voice, or stray from his effortless flow. Snoop, on the other hand, was at one time an edgy MC with range and emotion. From his sharp and venomous verses on tracks like, "Pump Pump" and "The Shiznit," Snoop was deft at sticking words up under your ribcage. Older tracks are reference points because those are the days that 213 hail from. It was not the overly laid back Snoop, the slightly less laid back Warren, and the impromptu Nate. That is exactly what we're getting. A too smooth, thus energy-lacking effort, that sounds more like a Gap Band album than any Hip-Hop triad. The most blatant rap tracks like, "213 Tha Gangsta Clicc" and "MLK" are dominated by aggressive synthesized beats. The softer side of things shine through because the better half of this album comes from smooth tracks like, "Another Summer", "Run On Up", and "Lil' Girl." Warren G's cadences throughout the album are taking on an all-too close resemblance to his half-brother, Dr. Dre's style of delivery. "MLK" and "Absolutely" are major proof of that. On the lyrical side of things, Nate steals the show. "Mary Jane" and "So Fly" are two of the album's more exciting cuts that reveal Nate's fabulous quality. He doesn't stay boxed-in by hooks, but rather Nate Dogg dances around most verses of this album with that one-of-a-kind baritone croon. Luckily, Dave Chapelle's Rick James persona is the only guest, lasting an interlude. But, in the wake of Rick's death, the humor is lost. While 213 didn't water-down their album with outsiders, much is to be desired considering the years of hype.   One of the most disturbing facts of a 213 album is that it has no producer. Warren G has refused to produce anything since the lackluster sales of his last album. As a result, this album uses music supplied by producers who have no cognition of what the original 213 was, is or should sound like. The only reputable producer that fits the mold is DJ Pooh, who is responsible for "Groupie Luv." While Nottz, Hi-Tek, and Kanye West are wonderful producers, this wasn't their place. The one effort that does seem to match an early vibe, is "Joysticc." This track uses "Juicy Fruit" percussion, with thick synth tones and a new wave chorus. Another track that Nate dominates is "So Fly." This outstanding soul chop (with vinyl hiss) is provided by none other than Missy Eliot. We can even forget that Smilez & Southstar tried this same beat before. Otherwise, this album barely separates itself from an Eastsidaz album.   Perhaps the hardest reality of this album is the jaded element. It's hard to watch your heroes get so cocky they forget why they're originally in it. It had been widely hoped that this album would be a return to the way things were. Instead, we have three aging stars in total ignorance of their history together, using their fame and wealth as large subject matter, over foreign production. After a dozen years of believing that 213 was the West's super group, this album only affirms the fact that it's truly Westside Connection who wears that crown.   2.5 outta' 5 
   It is difficult to argue with the luminaries who adore this book and the readers who shower Palace Walk with superlatives, but I thought it was generally tedious, repetitive, and hard to finish.  Yes, this is a close examination of Egyptian family life but the question is, "What is it about this family that makes it worth 500 pages?"  The father is truly loathesome, the mother is painfully timid, and the children are vacuous.  Mr. Mahfouz seems deliberate in his obsession for redundant detail.  I get it that Khadija has a large nose, that Amina has small eyes, that Kamal has a big head, that fleshy women are more attractive to the lecherous Yasin than thin ones but what do these things do for plot and character development?  I sincerely tried to like Palace Walk but I could not find anything to like.  The only redeeming character was Kamal but he is just a kid so by the time I get through the rest of the trilogy (if I can manage it) he will probably be grown up and just as repulsive, self-absorbed, and hypocritical as his Daddy.  Although reviewers say that this book will provide edification on Egyptian history, it offers little as either entertainment or learning.  I felt sorry for Amina, Aisha, and Khadja and I hope modern-day Egypt is not so egregiously unfair to its women but these women and this family, even by the standards of the day were(happily) unrepresentative.  Deliver me from books like this served up as great literature.  Thank you for your patience, and my regrets to everyone who disagrees with me (and it looks like that IS everyone).    
 Magical Child does have its moments but these are few and far between.  One has to wade through overwrought hyperbole and constant repetition to get at the few insights Mr. Pearce does have.  His comments on childbirth  are poignant and do illustrate just how far we have allowed technology and  modern medical practice to distort what should be a joyous and natural  process.   This book is laced with annoying terminology and proffers claims  of clairvoyant capabilities that would shame a supermarket tabloid.  Had  the author concentrated more on child development and less on developing a  polemic, a more insightful and useful book would have been the resul 
 After many years, I decided to finally give Kathy Reichs' Temperance Brennan series a go.  So, where better to start than her debut novel 'Deja Dead' which introduces Reichs' heroine.  Temperance Brennan is an American forensic anthropologist working in Montreal for what I'm guessing is the French-Canadian equivalent of a Medical Examiner's office.  Of course our heroine is head strong, independent, and unlucky in love (aren't they all?).  Well, some murders start turning up and, amazingly enough, our intrepid anthropologist is the only person that links the crimes together.  Do the police believe her?  No, so she must investigate the crimes on her own.  And by doing so, the murderer then turns his attention to Brennan and her family and friends (don't all killers eventually do that?).  First off, the book is bloated.  The book (at least the paperback version) clocks in at about 530 pages.  Reichs' writes too much about menial tasks that her character, Brennan, does during her usual day.  Does anyone really want to hear repeatedly about what a character had for dinner or what paperwork she does at work?  I know I don't want to read it.  Now I'm a person who enjoys a nice, long book but 'Deja Dead' (where did she get that title anyway?) is about two hundred pages too long.  And it is a very slow read.    Secondly, her main character, Brennan, just isn't likeable.  In fact, I found her quite annoying.  The policemen in the novel are portrayed as incompetent, arrogant jerks who are too worried about being right than they are about doing the right thing.  When in fact I think that they just didn't want to deal with this overly nosy anthropologist who is obviously stepping on toes and irritating people who are just trying to do their jobs.  Reichs' tries to portray Brennan as a lone crusader fighting against all these odds to get to the criminal.  When in fact she is an irritating anthropologist who has no business investigating a murder.  She is, basically, a laboratory-based employee who should not be in the field.  So I don't blame the cops in the book that don't like her.  She's butting her nose in where it doesn't belong and, in a part I actually liked, she ends up bringing irreparable damage to her family and friends.  I thought it a just outcome.  Also, after about the twentieth time of Brennan looking at some cop's rear end and saying "I like the way his butt looks...Oh, stop!  You need to get laid." I wanted to scream.  Dr. Brennan, at least in this debut novel, is extremely irritating.  Thirdly, I have read the basic plot of this book in a hundred other novels.  The suprise "switcheroo" ending is not suprising but more annoying...  It is just a cheap way to trick the reader.  And if I have to read about one more main character who ends up becoming the target of the "killer", I will scream.  Its pathetic.  How many times does it need to be written?  Its ridiculous.  Now, 'Deja Dead' is the first of Reichs' books that I've read.  I've heard that the following books in the Brennan series are better and I certainly hope this is the case.  I really didn't like the book:  not the characters, the plot, the writing...  But I will give Reichs another try and read the next book in the series.  If its as bad as 'Deja Dead', I don't think I ever read another one her books 
 Lucky for me, I saw this movie on TV and did not waste my money on buying it. I my opinion, this is one of the worst WWII movies that I have ever seen. It would be a lot easier to list the good points of the movie however, there are none. Its a very bad "B" war movie; the acting is really bad, blood looks like red paint, soldiers make stupid moves & of course get killed, the Japanese use American tanks, very bad music that plays in the background, etc. Basically, it is a very cheap movie and it shows right from the beginning. I'm not sure what movie was worse; Ambush Bay or Anzio!!  If you want to see good WWII movies, then watch: 12 o'clock High, Sink The Bismark, Objective Burma, They Were Expendable, Battleground, Wing And A Prayer, Battle of Britain, The Train, Run Silent Run Deep, Das Boat,The Great Escape, Saving Private Ryan, Band Of Brothers, Where Eagles Dare, The Longest Day 
 Samantha seems a lot like Becky.  A young woman whose life is very out of balance and doesn't know how to face up to the consequences of her decisions.  Instead of staying at the firm and working out her "mistake," she runs away.  This is just like Becky hiding her bills.  And then she gets a totally implausible job, because she can't tell the truth - again like Becky.  Samantha doesn't tell the truth until the very end when the media coverage forces her to.  I agree that the firm would never have taken her back; they probably would have viewed her as a former lawyer who had a nervous breakdown and was in need of psychiatric care.  Samatha, like Becky at times, seems somewhat manic, in that she's frantic somtimes and makes major life decisions on impulse in a state of agitation.  just like Becky when she rushes after her sister on a hike for which she is totally unprepared.  Lithium, anyone?  I don't have an opinion on the housewife/lawyer "controversy," but I do think Kinsella's protagonists need to grow up 
 I found any plot disrupted by the author's silly use of the term "mon". I believe he used it to give us an insight into Jamaican culture :=). Sam Tucker's use of the words "Boy" and "Son" are also very amateurish 
 Since I am new to Waldorf ideas, I was hoping for a few more clearly-stated Waldorf principles and ways to apply them. This book wanders quite a lot. Although I agree with the main point of the book, that children need to play, some of the research the author presents and then the jumps to conclusion that follow are a bit far-fetched. I guess I'll move on to some other books 
 The fact that this has had no US release was an immediate warning .... however as a longtime fan I figured I would check it out.  Boy is this bad.  There are a few decent tracks, however the truly awful "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", "This Magic Moment", "Only You" - among many others - make this unlistenable.  Miss Ross is a great singer and interpeter - check out the delicacy she approached the Billie Holliday material.  She is a producer's singer: Ashford and Simpson, CHIC, Holland Dozier Holland - even Hall & Oates - all were able to take her talent and create - in some cases - true all time classics.  This is a mess.  Diana, your voice still sounds great - STOP executive producing your projects 
 I expected much better quality for the price,  when the book arrived the last 25 pages or so were not even glued into the binding.  Poor workmanshi 
 Funny how an author can go through the Cointelpro's vicious tactics on the Amercian Indian Movement and only briefly mention the Bellcourts who were instrumental in the AIM Movement. Why? Because they say Ward Churchill is  not Native American. Obviously, the full story has not been presented to  the public due to his personal reasons. Read "In The Spirit Of Crazy  Horse" if you want an informative non one-sided book on the vicious  FBI. I will say the info on the Black Panthers was quite compelling. That  is the reason I gave it 1 star 
 I bought this book based on a review in Saveur.  It did not give me the information that I wanted and at $50+, I thought that it was very overpriced 
 I bought this book for the buddhism section because of another review I read. I have to say I was very dissapointed. It contains almost nothing on buddhism, just a bunch of arbitrary forms and excercises with very little explanation on how this is supposed to increase your chi, and improve your metal clarity. I felt like i might as well be reading a book on  voodoo.  But what really put me off of this book was the section on Wushu qigong. I fail to understand the merrits of conditioning such parts of the anatomy as the solar plexis, throat, armpits, and yes, groin. Here is an excerpt;  p.256 Section 8, Groin Conditioning  Step 4. Pulling. Use both hands and grab a hold of the base of the penis, pull up and circle from right to left, 30-50 times; thenleft to right 30-50 times. Then pull forward and release 30-50 times. Next massage the dantion area until it is hot.   Step 5. Hitting with the edge of your palms and bamboo stick bundles...  I am not kidding. This is an actual excerpt. It then goes on to say that once you have conditioned your groin sufficiently you should start hitting your groin with a bamboo stick. Wow! Maybe they are not aware of the invention of the cup.   It could be that there is some information of real value in this book, but after reading this, and some of the other equally silly stuff, I couldn't see the point of wasting more time reading further 
 I recommend reading this book, and follow along with Webster Tarpley's 911 Synthetic Terror Made in the USA. Also David Ray Griffins "A New Pearl Harbor". By the end of this exercise if you still believe the official myth put forth by this tome of lies, deceit and treason you should seek professional help.   Seriously this is not only wrong on nearly every relevant fact (Purposely), but purposefully ignores all the facts that could distract from the official MYTH that they were appointed to propagate.   Good job Keane! Great Whitewash! You'll go down in history as presiding over one of the biggest packs of lies ever created to cover up mass murder. What does this make you? 
 The book is comprehensive and somewhat useful as an introduction into the field. However, it has several flaws that make it fairly disappointing. The text is neither concise nor precise and some information is included that is of questionable value. (60 pages of experimental data in tabular form of thermal properties during cooling and warming of specific solutions are a waste of paper) Some sections are sloppy. For example on page 64, describing the phase diagram of water, you will find an incomplete sentence, a description that doesn't match the figure (where is the dotted line A-E?), and a very poorly drawn phase diagram (water doesn't really freeze at -15 C at 100 kPa) The author frequently uses non-SI units. A book in this price range should be properly edited and proof-read, in my opinion. This isn't, so I can't recommend it.     
 Don't buy this software even if you get it free after rebates.  It corrupts your windows registry and makes things worse for you.  You will feel your computer is far better after uninstalling this software.  Instead, just follow these steps to keep your PC fast: 1.  Run Disk Cleanup (provided by XP) 2.  Defrag your hard-disk regularly 3.  Clean the registry (there are lot of free software available to clean your registry).    That's all that you need to keep your computer fit.  No need to use softwares such as Fix-I 
 It's junk.  Bought one .. opened 15 cans and it quit.  I agree with all the other 9 out of 13 reviews, it powered out and no matter which brand of battery you put in it, it won't start up again.  I was stupid enough to buy a second one thinking it might be my fault.  Got the same result.  At $20.00 apiece, the Better Business Bureau should shut this company down 
 Darryl Worley's "Have You Forgotten" begs another, more relevant question -- "Do You Read the Paper." Despite the fact that Hussein's Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, he justifies our illegal invasion and occupation of that sovereign nation with references to the Twin Towers. To xenophobes like Worley, the Middle East is just one big nation of indistinguishable brown people. He justifies our warmaking with cliched references to "our freedom," apparently oblivious to the irony that the Patriot Act -- passed in reaction to 9/11 -- has effectively cancelled the Bill of Rights. He accepts the Official Version of 9/11, despite the fact that the story has holes big enough to fly an airplane through. I've heard some pretty reactionary stuff on country radio before, but this song definitely takes the cake. 
 The information itself is useful enough, although as others have mentioned it's essentially what's in the manual. The bigger problem that I ran into was that after 3 months the binding fell apart and pages began to fall out of the book! Perhaps that explains the new edition 
 I bought this book hoping for clues to help my high school students.  It didn't happen. This book would be a good choice for college instructors.  
 Amazon should not link this poor substitue of a book about leverage with "Leverage" by Ron Pate.  Avoid the mistake that I made 
 These translations  sadly do not give me essence . It is often however, instructive for a little money(this book is unbelievably well priced) to compare for yourself the entries of this book( the sutras are all numbered so its easy to do) with another translation.You owe it to yourself to own for instance the Penguin Dhammapada.As for this Muller copy,If you are a scholar of asian and european languages and seek fine contexts,it may well be educational . My scholarship is very  sadly limited,but my love is very unlimited,so I'm moved by words that speak to my inmost being 
 My tea came after three weeks and it was only one pack instead of six. I called and complained and the following week got another one pack instead of six.  That is all I ever received and my money was refunded.  Don't really know what happened...never got an explanation from the distributor 
 Legend, Lies & Cherished Myths of American history is a misleading title.  Do not assume this book to among likes of James Lowen's publications.  Some aspects of the book seem factual.  However, many arguements he makes such as the American revolution was not revolutionary at all, are completly rediculous.  This is yet another book in this kind of genre based upon assumptions and poor research. Avoid it at all costs.    Brian DeDentro (Rhode Island College 
 I was very disappointed in this book, and not just because it is difficult.  I was mainly disappointed because rather than explaining religion, Boyer explained the "transmission" of religious beliefs.  He explains the influence of "memes" (cultural archetypes)on people's beliefs, but he doesn't explain why some people reject them and believe something else 
 I am a Christian who reads these sorts of books frequently. This is easily the worst book of this sort I've ever read.  First, Glynn simply isn't a very good author. His style is awkward and unengaging, and he often repeats himself.  Second, he takes away with his left hand what he tries to give with his right. At times he seems to affirm the New Testament and Christ, but at other times he offers up a kind of universalism (e.g. Hindu near-death-experiences of Krishna prove that God sends to us after death whoever we'll be most comfortable with). At other times, he supports the idea that any belief at all is sufficient, as "proved" by prayer and meditation being medically effective regardless of the content of the patient's "faith".  Glynn's theology seems to be pick-and-choose. He likes what he likes (like the Sermon on the Mount) and rejects what he doesn't like (like some New Testament commands concerning women, and apparently nearly all of the Old Testament). All of this combines the be a poor apologetic indeed. To follow his example appears to mean accepting what you want and rejecting what you don't want, which hardly seems controversial.  Lastly, he simply doesn't do a good job of collecting or presenting evidence. Instead of this, I'd recommend the book, "God?: A Debate Between a Christian and an Atheist" by Craig and Sinnot-Armstrong. It's easily twice the book this one is, and half of it was written by an atheist 
 Of the five DVD's in the set, all five were defective.  Two had video dropouts through much of the disk, and the remainder would show some problems and then skip over large parts of the program.  They had to be returned as defective.  This happened on two good DVD players 
 I picked this book up because Amazon recommended it based on other books I liked. I was hoping for another Augusten Burroughs or David Sedaris. Instead, I found nothing interesting, unique, or even very funny about this book. The chapter on vomit did me in. 
 If you want bang for your buck, pick up Rachael's 365 book instead of this one.  The recipes here are mostly found in that book as well.  These recipes really aren't all that innovative, as far as kids recipes go (you already know how to cook hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches, right?), and the Rachael Ray 365 book has lots more information about altering recipes to suit your needs and other really helpful hints.  
 This book does cover a good bit of the material included on the exam.  However, it omits quite a bit of it, too.  Passing the exam requires much expertise with networking principles, and this book does not come close to covering that subject 
 I've always been a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks, and I couldn't wait to read Dear John. Well, there was no reason to rush. It starts out okay, but then just gets more and more depressing. The main girl character is annoying and you hope that John will find someone who deserves him, instead of just pouting over her for most the book.  I cannot wait for another Nicholas Sparks book, but only because I want to know that he hasn't lost his touch, and that this novel was just a fluck 
 Lian Hearn lost me on this one.  This is the third and final book of the original Tales of the Otori trilogy (there's a fourth book set decades after this one ends that reportedly resolves the one dangling issue from the trilogy) and it is easily the worst.  Across the Nightingale Floor was very good with swift pacing, a mentally tough heroine and solid action; Grass for his Pillow was a decent middle volume that moved the story forward, set up the final book and did not lose too much momentum.  Brilliance of the Moon is a relative flop.  The two main characters, Takeo and Kaede, make laughably stupid decisions.  Kaede loses too much of her inner strength -- she becomes simply the damsel in distress.  And the anti-climactic, deus ex machina resolution to Takeo's quest is entirely too unsatisfying.    If you can read Book 1 and enjoy it as a stand-alone novel despite its status as the first in a trilogy/tetralogy, do so.  But you're forewarned before you get too deep into the story, the ending in this volume is pure disappointment 
 This documentary covered what I had seen in other documentaries without anything really new.  The only new thing I really couldn't stand was Bettany Hughes comparing the Spartans to the Nazis.  This was so juvenile.  It was a cheap sensationalist way to fill her narrative.  She did it on more than one occasion.  Comparing everything militant to the Nazis is old and out of date.  Yes, the Nazis would have liked to imitate the Spartans is many ways, but the two cannot be compared.  Please skip the cheap sensationalism when dealing with a very interesting ancient Greek society.  There are much better documentares available made by the history channel.  Its a shame to have such an otherwise good PBS production be wasted on poor narration 
 When I bought the book, I was really looking forward to it.  I THREW IT AWAY. What a horrible book! Medieval homosexuality is not a 'must-read' for young adults! I was ashamed of it 
 The only swindle here is this movie. It is a farce and a lie and a slap in the face of the legacy of the Sex Pistols. And even as a piece of fictional filmaking, it's just not that good. As others have noted, the period clips of Pistols and solo Sid Vicious performances are the only redeeming feature. But the "story" as such is lacking in so many ways; the acting and script are hilariously bad and the film transfer is simply atrocious. Buy it if you will ( on sale or used if you can ) but please don't take it seriously. 
 Period dramas are, by definition, delicate commodities: they're balanced on that, ahem, "razor's edge" between high brow and just plain fussiness.  I think "Howard's End" is a case of a robust novel buried in tea time and English lace.  Milliners, set designers and Helena Bonham Carter's hair stylist had their job cut out for them on this one 
 A catalyst for the civil war, Uncle Tom's Cabin gives vivid details on the living conditions of the black slaves. The book's literary worth lies in the fact that people can make a difference by speaking out, and by preserving a kind of fictional history of the African American's pain, despite being redundant, rube and rife with tautology. The story is about Tom, a slave who saves his master's daughter and is promised his freedom. But his master dies before Tom is actually freed. The family falls upon hard times and Tom is sold to a horrible slave owner named Simon Legree. Legree tried everything to degrade Tom, but Tom holds firmly to his religious convictions. 
 First of all, 1 hour worth of workouts is not sufficient for 20 bucks.  Second of all, I missed the section that explained the requirement of a workout bench and dumbells to do most everything in the video so that was a pain.  Also, regardless of the fact that one girl does a beginners version of the excercises, it is still moderately difficult 
 What's so mind-boggling is the drugs that Kinsella must have been smoking in order to come up with this one.  Now read this description of the book: An albino, like his dead father, is convinced that a 3000 inning game took place 80-some years ago between the Chicago Cubs and the Iowa baseball Confederacy All-stars.  The albino is somehow able to go back in time and witness the game (as a matter of fact the local hicks use him as a good-luck charm and rub his head before stepping to the plate, allowing him to remain in the dugout) in all its glory. Then Teddy Roosevelt shows up and takesa few swings, telling the pitcher not to patronize him after throwing an easy pitch, and then making a cheap pun about the bat being a "big stick."  Soon after that Leonardo DaVinci showed up in a balloon and watches a few innings.  Shortly thereafter a giant flood occurs and some of the players spontaeneouly throw themselves in the waters.  To fill the vacancies, a statue of an angel plays in the outfield.  There, I think I've covered all the bases, so to speak.  Oh, I forgot the Native America named "Drifting Away" who is messing with the reality of this county and eventually plays in the game too.  Look, I don't like to be so completely negative, but the book was ludicrous.  To make matters worse, it throws in a fairly gratuitous love interest who is the spitting image of the Albino protagonist's mother (kinda Fruedian) and more seemingly random things than could possibly be mentioned in this review. And bear in mind, reading these things, that I'm a baseball fan.   3/1 
 Touted as the "missing manual" I was expecting good guidance on concrete applications.  I bought the software with the primary intent of converting various large Excel files into a database. The manual is large on theory and small on concrete help. My efforts to convert Excel files failed so often that I finally gave up trying.  The book was of no help. 
 Whatever happened to the wall of sound vibrations of such tracks as "Strange Fruit" and "Black Metallic"??? Here, in a so-called "return to form", Rob Dickinson does a Bob Mould, cranking up a Linn Drum programmer to about 175 BPM and leaves it nailed there for about an hour while he tries to make SOME kind of lyrical contribution (despite the fact that alot of his attempts at political commentary are embarassingly outdated and overconfident).  Meanwhile, synthesized and over-treated guitar tracks weave in and out, sounding like some weird hipster Starbucks soundtrack. PLEASE.  If I wanted Dave Matthews-style jam band yuppie noise with a click track, I would have bought My Morning Jacket!!! Good grief. 
 I know I was supposed to find Jim Lynch's debut novel, "The Highest Tide," wonderous(!), and magical(!) and mystical(!).  Surely, the diminutive precocious hero of the book, young Miles O'Malley (who has a particular knack for finding odd sea life on his late night strolls along the beach of the Puget Sound) is irresistible(!), and inspirational(!).  As you can tell from my sarcasm, none of it really worked for me.  It's not that I really despised the book -- it's just that I don't like when an author tries to awe me on every other page.  By about the middle of the book, I started getting pretty bored with not only Miles, but also with his rough-around-the-edges air guitar playing side-kick, Phelps; the totally messed up love of his life, Angie; and his best friend, the elderly, new age spouting, prophetic, Florence.  The last described character especially annoyed me, in the way her off the wall predictions always came true.  I guess we have to trust the author's depiction about the sea-life that he describes.  I don't know about you, but I'm not about to start researching the sex lives of barnacles, clams and mussels for verification purposes.  Although, I admit it would be kind of neat to find a giant squid washed up on the beach.   
 Yeah...this book basically seems to follow Dan Browne's to the letter. I had to laugh at another review of it, especially this line: "This is the only [commentary on The Da Vinci Code] written from a balanced, secular point of view."  As if a secular point of view is any less biased regarding God/religion than a religious one is. Hilarious.  If you want to know more, go for the Tony Robinson series on the Real Da Vinci Code, especially when he wants to excavate under the church. Brilliant stuff 
 i would review it if i got it. come on guys. i placed the order on 1/6/06. 
 I have hope that someday Wes Craven will return to greatness, that his abilities as a filmmaker will once again outshine his horrible motives for movies like Scream 2, cursed, and Dracula 2000. I have waited patiently for him to make another cinematic cult classic like "A Nightmare on Elm Street" or "The Last House on the Left", but alas "Red Eye" fails to be anywhere near as good as those two previous movies. First of all, the flick is PG-13, which means no blood, no sex, and no good stuff that accounts for a horrible plot. A pair of breasts and a bloody brain splatter can make up for bad plot twists sometimes.  I must admit there are directors that can pull off a PG-13 horror flick but Wes Craven is not one of the chosen few. 	 As soon as the opening credits are over the plot has unfolded in my head, yeah it's that predictable. The main character Lisa is on the phone with her dad while in the airport. Her grandmother just kicked the bucket and she is hopping a red eye flight (creative title, huh) to visit daddy. Immediately you realize the old man has something to do with the story line, and he is obviously more than a destination point. While on the phone with Pops, Lisa puts him on hold to speak with Cynthia, a girl that is taking her place as hotel manager while she engages on her trip. Cynthia has to somehow be a victim.  Next Lisa meets a gentleman that buys her a drink in the airport bar and the two of them just so happen to sit next to each other on the airplane; he is obviously the bad guy. Not just because of the random circumstances, but he has those bad guy eyes. The movie is over from my point of view, besides a few inconsistencies, the viewer already knows that the father will be threatened if Lisa and Cynthia don't work together to make some violent action against a guest at the hotel. Now we all know that this won't happen because all crappy movies have happy endings. That is why seven was a splendid film by the way, the villain was triumphant. The guy that sits next Lisa on the plane will most likely be the only one who dies in the entire movie. It's all expected, and it's all dribble. Which may be why they made the movie PG-13, no one over the age of thirteen should be allowed to see it.  	This movie could have been saved, if the villain had a better plan, if he was more convincing. If the protagonist wouldn't be so heroic if her morals wouldn't be so goody two shoes. If the movie wasn't so black and white good versus evil it would have been tolerable.  
 This book is pretty much like all the other diet books around. 
 I wish I could give this zero stars.  Save your money and go get a spiral notebook at your local drug store, it would be just as useful.  I love the show Good Eats and had great expectations about anything with Alton's name on it.  I guess I should have read the reviews first. I am sending it back tomorrow for a refund 
 I am a reasonably big fan of Madonna. I bought 'Confessions' the day it dropped in November and went twice to see her on the tour in New York City, both of which were such amazing, absolutely incredible nights that I am absolutely thrilled she is in talks for an NBC special to bring the show to network television this fall.  Nevertheless, I cannot honestly recommend this CD single at all.  Don't get me wrong, the 'Confessions' album is an awesome spectacle from start-to-finish, and the remixes for "Hung Up" and "Sorry" are just awesome. The Bill Hamel and Pet Shop Boys remixes of the former and Paul Oakenfold's remix of the latter are so awesome that they equal or even arguably surpass the fun of the originals.  Thus it is all the more dissapointing that the remixes of "Get Together" are as terrible as they are. Even the "Jacques Lu Cont Mix," which is named for the French alter ego of producer Stuart Bryce, who actually produced the original 'Confessions' album, is nothing special, despite its rhythmic, quirky guitar work which sounds promising at first. Quickly something sounds wrong; this sounds like the kind of frothy, slightly above mid-tempo music that one can usually hear played in swanky, high-brow cocktail bars. That's right - lounge music.  "Danny Howells & Dick Trevor KinkyFunk Mix" starts out to be more promising but quickly grows boring due to its meandering, lingering pace and only sparing use of vocals/lyrics. In fact, none of the remixes on the CD use Madonna's vocals enough at all. The remixes of "Hung Up" and "Sorry," however, did, and that was an important part of why they were so good.  The "Tiefschwarz Remix" and "James Holden Remix" are even worse, since the former starts out with propulsive, frothy, initially promising dance beats but then never goes anywhere, while the latter is pure lounge music, complete with the sound of raindrops popping in and out.  The I Love New York (Thin White Duke Mix) is also terrible. Also remixed by Stuart Bryce (Think White Duke is another one of his undercover monikers), this remix yet again does not feature enough Madonna and the beats simply take the song nowhere.  Sure, you would probably dance to all of the songs on this CD if you were in a club and they came on. But for Madonna, they are terrible. And since they overall make minimal use of her vocals, it is doubly hard to find anything satisfying.  Worst of all, the moment I heard "Get Together" I could not WAIT to hear remixes of it, and when I heard it would be a single I was so excited that I would. The original song, from beginning to end, spells "DANCE/POP CLASSIC."   Imagine my dissapointment then when the remixes finally arrived in June and they were this terrible. With such an incredible song, one would think a remixer who knew what they were doing would not be able to mess it up, yet that is exactly what has happened. This CD is certainly not worth the $7.49 I paid on it.  Let's hope Madonna goes back to Bill Hamel, Paul Oakenfold and Pet Shop Boys for the remixes of "Jump." 
 Way back in the early 90s I bought my first copy of Castleman's Nevada Handbook. I was astonished at the breadth and depth of the book, and I was delighted at the author's idiosyncratic but engaging style. I liked the book so much I actually wrote Castleman a letter of praise (this was pre-Amazon). As new editions came out every three years or so, I bought each one. (I visit Nevada annually.) Unfortunately, someone decided this new edition needed to be a mere ghost of previous editions. I can't fathom what the idea was here. It wasn't just to make room for more Vegas information, because this edition is much shorter than previous ones. Reading over comments from other readers, I notice that the positive reviews seem to come from people who never saw the previous editions. Those who'd seen earlier versions of the book are, like me, deeply disappointed. What a shame that some editor somewhere decided "Hey, I've got an idea --- let's take this great book and make it WORSE. 
 Unfortunately, I haven't read the book, but this page seems to be a breeding ground for posers. 
 An abbreviated version of the REAL Kaizen book; Kaizen Event Implementation Manual. OK for a quick read, copies much of what's in the Kaizen Event Implementation Manual. Something as important as doing and understanding Kaizen deserves the real thing, not this. Save your money. 
 From the 5 star reviews it is clear that Mr. McCarry has found his target audience, Clinton-hating yahoos who will never tire of hearing the same old recycled trash.  And by putting it in a novel he doesn't have to even justify it, just hint, hint.  Another advantage of this target audience is, apparantly, that one need not be able to plot, develop characters, dialogue, or any of the usual writerly skills, just type out the right code-words and one is home.  
 Okay, first things first: "The Magificent 7" or "Seven Samurai," this movie is most definitely NOT.  It is more like "The Storm Riders" meets "Conan" meets "Mad Max."  The action is grotesque, without any really great choreography. The plot is thin. Character development is poor. Overall, very poorly done...   Don't waste your time or money 
 This may be the worst book I've ever finished.  I was expecting a book that would offer small tidbits of funny information, some shots, and some glorious facts about the great men who have led our country over the various centuries.  Instead, we are treated to a salacious compendium of president's peeing on secret service men and other president's blaming secret service men for farting.  If you are looking for "The Man Show" version of the presidents, then by all means fork over your hard earned dollars. We are informed that every Republican from IKE to Bush were bumbling idiots, and every Democrat from FDR to Clinton were mere victims of circumstance. If you are looking for a Michael Moore or Al Franken version of the historical lives of some of the greatest men who ever lived, then by all means add to cart. Thanks to this author's portrayal of U.S. Presidents, I will forever read an author's portrayal of the two most divisive presidents of our time, Nixon and Clinton, before I make such a purchase again. Nixon and Clinton were both failures in their own right.  Nixon and Clinton were both men blessed with an overwhelming amount of potential, but they both flushed it away with their individual incidents. O'Brien ends each portrayal with an accurate summary of the unfortunate end of each of the individual tenure, but it is within the body of these portrayals that O'Brien lends his creative writing skills to the eventual manipulation of the reader.  Examples to the point, Newt Gingrich is snide and rapacious, and Kenneth Starr is a ruthless Republican bloodhound. Do we really need these adjectives?  We read no such adjectives to describe the behaivor of the Democrats in power during Nixon's term. We see no adjectives or adverbs to describe the activities of a Woodward and Bernstein. I would consider it silly for a compendium of this sort to glorify the presidency of Nixon, for his tenure was not one to emulate. Nixon and Clinton had their otherwise promising presidencies brought down by silly incidents that would've been seen as such were it not for the cover-ups that followed. O'Brien goes onto to proclaim Bob Jones university as preposterously Conservative, he declares The Great Society as a legislative success. It maybe true that The Great Society was a success in accumulating enough votes for passage, but can the Great Society be considered a success in an historical perspective? He portrays the anti-American Carter as the greatest living former president in recent memory.  He mentions Carter's farcical Nobel Peace prize as testament to this fact. What is this? Everyone knows that that prize was a joke provided by the Nobel people looking to make an anti-American statement. It should be noted that the great peace activist Yasser Arafat also won this award. O'Brien fails to mention the Johnson administration's propaganda involving the Gulf of Tonkin incident that Johnson used to convince American's that America's role needed to be escalated in Vietnam. It was an incident historians are now claiming never happened, but this isn't used to define Johnson's administration? He maintains that every Republican since Ford gained office with shenanigans and slick marketing. He ends the book with the Moore/Franken style rants against the George W. Bush election, which many nonpartisan publications--including the Democrat Miami Herald and the USA Today--are saying they could've recounted until the end of time and Bush would've won.  He comments on Bush's slick maneuvering to enter into the war with Iraq. I will grant you that this book was written before news of the the oil for food UN scandals broke. These scandals involved France, Germany and Russia, and this scandal may have affected the manner in which pre-war activities were conducted. All in all, shouldn't a book of this variety be written to open debate rather than close it with propaganda material? I found some of the portrayals of presidents one rarely hears mentioned, such as Zachary Taylor and Franklin Pierce, but I found myself reevaluating all of these portrayals after reading about those with which I am much more familiar. I am currently an unsuccessful author, but I have written enough, and studied the craft enough, to know a writer's manipulation when I see it. It's a shame too, for this could've been such an interesting idea. As I have mentioned, Cormac O'Brien has taught me a valuable lesson when buying historical perspectives: try and learn the author's agenda before buying his book. I have read a couple of books of this sort that will lambaste and glorify an LBJ or a Clinton as often as they lambaste and glorify a Nixon or a Reagan. While I will agree that it is difficult for an individual to separate himself from his perspective, it should always be the responsibility of said author to keep this to a matter of degrees. It is my hope that the anxious readers who share my love for information, regardless of their individual biases, will search elsewhere 
 Hey, I shoot for a living.  I was hoping this book would help me shoot perfect scores.  Like the title states, "Master Handgunner".  Well, I wasted my money.  This book tells you nothing.  Pathetic 
 I loved The Secret Life of Bees but I found this book to be formulaic and uninteresting.  Its difficult to like any of the characters, especially  the main character, and much of the scenes with the monk are sexually gratuitous. It has as much deapth as a Harlequin romance novel.  The relationship between her and the mother was a bit more dimensional but only slightly.  All in all, a poor follow-up to Sue Monk Kidd's break out bestseller.  Don't waste your time.  
 I enjoyed the book very much until I read the letter in Chap. VIII. It mentions an amulet. An amulet is of the occult.This disturbed me very much 
 I picked this book up because I saw the author interviewed on the Daily Show. Oops. I'm going to have to lower my trust in Jon Stewart a notch. One useful piece of advice I've received is not to be afraid to cut bait on a book that you don't really like. So after about 150 pages, I calling it quits with this one.  This book is supposed to recount the author's experience of growing up with a father in the CIA but it reads like a history lecture--and a dull one at that. I'm not sure why Richardson writes as though he's trying to distance himself from the narrative as much as possible. I'm not sure why anyone outside of his immediate family or friends would be interested in this book: the personal narrative lacks warmth and emotion and the anecdotes only hint at the gripping spy stories a lifetime of Tom Clancy has prepared me for 
 Most of the other reviews for this toy are correct. when it works my kids love it. and it is pretty cool when it works. but it doesn't work very well very often. you need to find just the right car and everything needs to line up exactly. and even then the car crashes a lot. we have found one car (out of about 200) that works somewhat well. but even with this car the success rate is about 1 in 15. so, read the reviews and make your own judgements. personally, i'm glad this was a gift and i did not spend any money on it. my kids will still play with and enjoy it, but not as much as they would if it worked better 
 I ordered two items for my sister. After almost three weeks my money was returned with a notice that the items were not in stock. The items were a present for her. I will not order from this seller again. 
 This will only please the most ardent vampire fans.  Why?  It's exceedinly poorly written.  I figured when I watched it it would either be a decent movie or so bad that it wouldn't matter.  Sadly it was neither.  Don't get me wrong, it was bad, but in all of the wrong ways.  For example the writing, plot dialog, character development is basically not there...well they are they're just about as interesting as chalk.  Unfortunately the acting's not bad.  This results in what must be the worst kind of bad movie.  You can't laugh at the bad dialog because it isn't bad enough, it's just flat.  And you can't laugh at the poor acting because for the most part it's acceptable.  It's got gore and blood, but it isn't the least bit scary.  In general my accessment is it is bad in the most painfully mediocre and forgetable way.  if you want sexy evil wait for the remake of Amityville Horror to be released.  Ryan Reynolds may not play a vampire, but that movie had more development in it's credits than this had in it's entirety 
 This book was a great disappointment to me. It falls so short of scholarly heights that it might as well have been written by a graduate student. Instead of setting forward a strong  interpretation of ideas and of documents, Sproul merely lists theological views, mixing them with long quotations from very antiquated sources (i.e., page after page from Schaff Herzog Encyclopedia!!!). His work is not up to date, insofar as he does not refer to any contemporary work on the subject; it lacks a critical approach (to him anything that does not reflect Reformed theology is either bad or inadequate); and finally, it fails to reach a conclusion and to break any new ground whatsoever. In other words this book was a waste of my time. Having written a book on the subject myself, I seriously question his grasp of the Semi-pelagian controversy (in my view it was not about monergism or synergism in the work of regeneration, but about the chronological and hierarchical priority of grace over free will and about predestination). The following are the views discussed in his book: -We are capable of obedience (Pelagius). No mention of Augustine's works; no reference to an up to date bibliography on Pelagius either. -We are incapable of obedience (Augustine). No serious review of Augustine's main works on the topic of grace and free will. -We are capable of cooperating (semi-Pelagianism). Cassian was not the abbot of Massilia (p.70); semi-Pelagians' main contention was NOT synergism (p.73). Trent and the recent Catechism of the Catholic Church follow semi-pelagianism because they talk about our cooperari. What book "on grace and freedom" did Prosper write in 432? What is Sproul talking about?  -We are in bondage to sin (Luther) -We are voluntary slaves (Calvin) -We are free to believe (Arminius) -We are inclined to sin (Edwards) -We are not depraved by nature (Charles Finney) -We are able to believe (Lewis Chafer) 
 I loved the first Santa Clause, so I was excited  to see this one.  but it's so lame!  it's like they decided at the last minute to hurry and make this in time for christmas. the storyline is far from solid,  the lines in this one that are supposed to be funny are just flat, and it really doesn't have the warm & cozy 'feel good' that the first one had.  I don't think I'll be seeing #3, after how disappointing this one was.   : 
 NOVA isn't what it used to be.  The BBC Series "The Planets" contains much of the same subject matter, presented more accurately with interviews of more relevant people 
 This is a nice DVD, if you don't mind that 27.9 percent of the original theatrical image has been removed for the DVD exhibition, so that the DVD image fills your entire 4:3 television screen (theatrical aspect ratio - 1.85:1; DVD aspect ratio - 4:3).  If you're okay with that, enjoy! 
 i bought this album one day and i regret it SO bad, i mean i wasted 17 bucks on the lamest cd i could ever buy. take my word for it, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ALBUM!!!!! 
 While I have loved all of the Miss Julia books, this one dragged on and on over the stupidest plot. So you might not be married? Go to the court house and get married. I read the first half, realized it wasn't getting any better, and skimmed to the end. Better luck and a better story next time Ann 
 Cook's Illustrated is the first cooking magazine that I'd found myself truly motivated to read cover-to-cover, even though they DO insert advertisements for their own products, which I suppose, to them, makes this an "ad-free" magazine, but I'm not surprised they've bent the rules with that claim. The one time I found it necessary to contact Cook's Illustrated about a customer service issue, I was simply floored by the treatment that I received... I'll simply leave it at that.  I personally don't intend on re-subscribing ("Fine Cooking", here I come!). You, however, may find that this is the cooking magazine for you. And, as far as what they do goes, Cook's Illustrated IS good at what they do - I'll give them that.    If you have not found this review to be helpful, I'm sorry if I haven't made the value in my warning apparent. Just know that there are those of us out there who HAVE had bad experiences, and are simply trying to prevent others from experiencing the same. 
 This book is very simplistic. It covers basic topics and not in a logical order. In other words, this is not a how-to book. I was specifically looking to gain an understanding of neworking a home computers with a broadband Internet connection. This book could offer no help and had only one paragraph on routers (which wasn't very helpful). If you are just trying to understand what a home network is about then maybe this book will be helpful, but this will not help you set up a network 
 J.D. Salinger's last published work is more than 43 years old now, and still stirs many in the same absent way Seymour Glass animates his brother Buddy in this pair of stories first published in 1963. Are both cases of delusional devotion?  In the first story, "Raise High The Roof Beam, Carpenters," originally published in The New Yorker in 1955, we get what amounts to Salinger's first deep-dish treatment of the Glass family saga ("Zooey" saw print later, and previous stories featuring the Glasses were far less insular) as Buddy shows up for Seymour's wedding, only to find Seymour stood up his bride. In the second piece, 1959's "Seymour: An Introduction," Buddy foregoes any semblance of plot to explain who Seymour was.  Like a lot of other people, I am put off by the convoluted nature of "Seymour," as well as the explanations of those who defend it. Actually, there could be something to the idea of writing a plotless story, using characters like the Glasses people know from other works, but this is assuredly not it. Salinger too obviously indulges himself, spouting contempt at his generation and his critics, throwing up lame jokes and referencing obscure Japanese poets as a smokescreen to conceal his literary, intellectual, and metaphysical nakedness.  "What a marvelous convenience it would be if writers could let themselves describe their characters' clothes, article by article, crease by crease," Salinger writes in the role of Buddy, pretty much summing up the approach of "Seymour" as well as its underlying failure. His interest in his subject is not only all-consuming, it is not all that deep.  "Raise High" is a better story, though that's not saying much. "Franny And Zooey," the previously published Salinger book, also combined a better story with a weaker one, but there at least you got one terrific story in "Franny," a bold, empathetic tale of power and focus. "Raise High" doesn't know where it's going, and is in no hurry to get there. You get nice asides, like when Buddy sees an old chair and remembers a beloved bulldog, long dead, who slept there and left his chewmarks. There's also some arresting ambiguity, as when Buddy reads Seymour's journal and we get maybe a suggestion of unease at some apparent insanity.  But "Roof Beam" doesn't end so much as fizzle away, with Buddy snoozing in an empty apartment after the mystery of Seymour's absence has been resolved via an unseen phone call. Emptyness is a recurrent theme in Salinger's Glass writings, here as in "Franny & Zooey," where various Glasses are often seen in isolation thinking or writing about absent kin. For such a happy family, there's an overwhelming sadness about the Glasses that suggests Salinger found himself in a bit of a dead end with them, one from which he never emerged. Further evidence of this can be found in the web-available "Hapsworth 16, 1924," Salinger's last public blast, published in The New Yorker in 1965.  Salinger was one of the most important American writers of our lifetime, not to mention a seminal figure of our culture, but his greatness lies elsewhere, not here. Read this only if you are a Salinger completist, or else interested in the price genius can extract from its recipients 
 This was one of the few books on Japanese history available in my local library, so I read it second (the first was "Embracing Defeat," a history of the post-WWII Occupation) in trying to learn more about Japan.  Unfortunately, on the one subject I do know in detail, Pearl Harbor (any and all books by Gordon Prange are excellent) the authors were just plain wrong. The errors were all in one direction, too -- dismissing the dull facts in favor of kewl conspiracy theories. I couldn't find out where they got their errors, either, since the attributions both in the text and in footnotes were vague to the point of uselessness.  The result is that I've soaked in a gripping political thriller whose background I _know_ is distorted by an unknown amount in the direction of conspiracies -- and there's a lot of conspiring in this book. I'm not optimistic about how many of the other conspiracies are made up, too, and it's going to take me a lot of research in better books to come to an intelligent conclusion. Thanks so much. Very few books leave the reader feeling dumber than he started out 
 I found the material mostly interesting if not occassionaly difficult to read.  However, I found it infurating that the review questions and problems asked at the end of the chapters, could not be answered based on the materials in the chapters.   Nothing like setting you up for a fall.  This isn't unique to this book, it seems a trend in most text books these days.  It reflects poorly on the material, the publisher, and the author.  You'd think an instructional book, would endeavor to provide its students with the tools necessary to answer the questions asked, instead of asking questions that the material doesn't cover.  Really piss poor.  
 I hate this book. It is extremely boring and it is way too long.  There are too many characters to keep track of and many of them are extremely similar. Do not read this unless forced to. I like to read, but this nearly put me to sleep.  avoid at all cost 
 It's unfortunate, but Todd's tenth Claudia Seferius mystery is probably the worst. Todd has has our lovable heroine hotfooting it off to the tiny Roman governed client kingdom of Histria. Failure to read the contractual small print means she thinks she's off to negotiate a lucrative wine contract but after considerable stringing along she discovers that it's in fact to marry the King. After ariving on the peninsula she finds herself chaperoned by the effortlessly personable Mazares, the oak tree that is Pavan and the King's close family  comprising the King's brother, Kazan, his wife Rosmerta, their sons, Marek and Mir and finally Vanu, married to one of the sons but sleeping with Kazan. As usual bodies start turning up although these are historical. - Mazares first wife, Brac - first in line to throne, the old king Dol, Mazares, son and daughter, a boat builder,  the physician until we get quite a list. After dressing up as a goddess for the Zeltane festival Caludia spends most her time figuring out how to escape her impending matimony and the rest half heartedly chasing down ridiculous murder theories and spending time at the local stray waifs farm headed up by Salome, Tobias, Lora and the rest of the white robed Amazons. All the while we get Todd's small chapter inserts into the mind of the murderer - this time called Nosferatu. It's all a bit tedious until Orbilio turns up to turn over Claudia's stomach again and save the day, Claudia, and anyone else who happens to be around. As I said, this is the weakest of the Serferius novels simply because it's not exciting in any way and Claudia's heart's just not in it. Maybe we've a classic case of Davis here - our heroine needs to be in Rome to be at her best. Hopefully the next one will have Claudia back to her spitting, fiery self.. 
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 I chose this book for my book club because I had read Erdrich's other novel, The Master Butcher's Singing Club, which was flawed, but still great reading.  I was so disappointed in this novel.  It did not meet my expectations.  I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly.  The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la "Weekend at Bernie's."  Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say. I am less inclined to try her other novels after reading this one.  
 We are a family that loves games!  This game appears to be educational, but has NOT been fun to play.  The little tiles aren't easy to deal with, and the cheap plastic set-up leaves much to be desired.  Save your money and play hangman on the chalk board 
 fall asleep in  minutes what a joke.don`t waste your money on this product 
 Disapointed - this is a good 'couple of pages a sitting' bathroom read of occasionally amusing stuff. Perhaps a week's worth of quality turned into a year with silly suggestions and pictures! For a life changer I'd go with Danny Wallace's Join M 
 I've had this book for awhile and I've noticed that some of the drawings, especially the fashion illustrations look rather unprofessional.  There are drawings, renderings, that you would never see in fashion world.   Some of the drawings look like they are fine art life drawings; others look very much like student work, some look just badly drawn and should not be shown as explemary work for those who wish to learn.  I think that they are better books out there and this is not one of them.  
 I just bought a Montessori prescchool & kindergarten and changed the name.  I use 'Montessori tools,' yet I feel there are more 'updated' tools to use as well.  After reading this book and other materials about  Montessori, I feel that the Montessori way of teaching as a foundation is  fantastic, but there are so many 'updated' ways to enhance the Montessori  Method.  I got 'lost' several times reading this book, particularly the  first half of the book.  I just think, like most information out there,  some of the material is worth using 
 Trying to figure out if I like the book or not.  It is a reasonably paced adventure with frequent sex and loving descriptions of skimpy clothing every few pages. Matter of fact, trying to figure out the author's reason for frequent sex and loving attention to detail on skimpy clothing appearing throughout this book kept me from following the plot.  
 This book is not a good introductory to process control. Avoid this book at all cost  
 I ordered this brand because it had the least amount of sugar. The cherries were gritty (dirty?, sand?) and did not have the tart taste of locally purchased dried cherries.  Now I'm stuck with a whole box of them that no one in my family wants to eat 
 This book really isn't necessary. I found this book to be too dense or too superficial for what I needed. I bought this during my first semester of law school and thought after perusing it in the bookstore that it could be useful. The reality is that I used it only a couple of times, and have only opened twice since. The book has a ton of information if you have never had civil procedure, but what I have found is that it's not useful on the job and there are much better study aides. I have repeatedly touted the benefit of the Emmanuel, but I want to doublely do so hear. The charts alone makes the Emmanuel far superior, but the presentation also helps as well. I don't think anything was more helpful for any class than the Emmanuel's flow chart for personal jurisdiction. This nutshell also when you're studying just becomes more of the same-old, same-old. In practice, there are better and more respected books like Wright & Miller that prove to be better sources and are respectable enough to site in a brief. In essence, do not buy this unless you haven't been going to class. It is too dense and won't help for exam. In practice, it doesn't have the resources you need.  Also, it is very expensive if you are a student, and need exam help 
 Dharma states in her book that the thymus has limited function, only secreting immune factors. Thousands of medical articles and numerous excellent books on the thymus have been produced in the last hundred years. Not only does the thymus control your brains health, secrete neuropeptides that strengthen and mature cells ability to recept neuropeptides and fight infections in the brain, the thymus prevents autoimmune diseases by producing new MHC restricted CD3+, CD4+ t-cells that recognize self from non self, prevent death from AIDS & chemotherapy by producing new mature tcells, and to top it off, articles have been produced on the thymus preventing aging, one staying women age slower than men because their thymus shrinks/involutes slower and many interesting papers on hayflicks limit and telomerase (the enzyme that makes cells live forever) which is produce by the thymus to prevent aging. Normal cells replicate apprx. 80 times and die, telomerase allows them to live over 600 replications with no damage!

 This book seems to be more about how to gain a birthmother's trust and confidence in order to get her baby, and how to work the adoption system. In so doing, the book loses sight of the fact that adoption exists in order to provide children with loving homes, not to provide infertile couples with children.  She does, however, help to explode a myth: that children placed for adoption are "unwanted." This is of course far from the truth, as Burns points out that birthmothers today usually aid in picking their child's parents and nearly always want to see, hold, and spend some time with their newborns prior to relinquishment.  Still, some of the advice can get potential adoptive parents into trouble, such as placing ads for a baby. In many states this is illegal.   Some advice in this book is helpful, but I must still urge potential adoptive parents to seek the assistance of a licensed adoption agency 
 I found it depressing and way too long.  Instead of admiration for the heroine, I felt aggravation.  An abusive alcoholic for a husband, no way to make ends meet except the occasional contest win, for items that had no use to the family--Arthur Murray Dancing Shoes, for example.  Barely able to feed the kids she already has, she eventually has 10.  I know women lived differently in the 50's, still, most learned to drive a car!  With so many little ones, it seems to me irresponsible to not be able to drive, esp. with all the emergencies in this very dysfuntional family.  I kept waiting for the part when she would throw the bum out, obtain an education or job skills and show her family how to survive on more than luck and corny jingles 
 The radio reception was good for about a month and then went south.  No matter where I put this in my home it won't pull in the stations I want.  I have two other radios that work fine, so it isn't my location.  Definitely look elsewhere 
 This music does not include the lyrics from the animated movie. A disappointment. Whats the point of this album if you can't sing along to the tunes? 
 Very poorly edited & proofread; numerous errors & omissions make for distracting & frustrating reading that undermines confidence in the material.  Buy, read and enjoy "The Complete Sailor" instead.   
 Sorry, but I'm just not a fan of clicker training or the concept of waiting around *ho hum* until your dog happens to do something that you want it to do. Granted, there is some helpful advice given within the pages of this book, but I'm very glad I didn't pay regular retail for it. (Yay, Amazon! 
 While the rhythm variations are plentiful in this book, there is scarcely little helpful instruction describing technique. For a book that purports to introduce bongo playing, one would expect more than three pages of  striking instruction and technique description. Photographs of individual  techniques are limited to one page of vague, grainy, black and white  photos. No illustrations or step-by-step technique descriptions are  provided. The CD is nice, but without better description of the individual  techniques, it proves but a frame for guesswork 
 I have to agree with Greg Ippolito's review.  The album is simply incomplete without Dirk Diggler's "You Got The Touch."  The most significant musical moment in the film.  Hard to believe it's not on Volume 2 either.  A shame 
 This book contains many fascinating statistics about the USA, and presents the work of an array of information designers.  Unfortunately, much of it is overblown, visually chaotic, and more concerned with "looking cool" than with conveying data to the reader.  I hope no employer sees this as "what information design is", since it does nothing short of degrade the profession 
 I read this book early in the fall of my 1L year.  At the time, I thought that the book was useful and that reading it would give me an edge over my classmates.  In retrospect, the book did not give me any edge and reading the book was a waste of time.    The book does give you confidence.  It leads you to think that you will be able to take apart a legal exam, reduce it to its essentials, and reason in a manner that your professors will appreciate.  I guess it might be worth your reading if you need a shot of self-confidence.    But I do not think that the book will make much of a difference in how anyone does on law school exams.  The authors' main point is to look for ambiguities (or "forks").  When you see something on your exam that looks ambiguous, try to explore all the ambiguities.  In other words, argue in the alternative--i.e., point out that if X is said to occur, then Y results, whereas if A is said to occur, then B results.  Let your professors know that you can see the little things that might produce completely different legal results.    This method is great as a theory.  However, it is difficult to apply the method in an actual test setting.  I remember that my first exam during my 1L year was in criminal law.  I was given a long fact pattern, and I tried to apply the "Getting to Maybe" method.  One problem I found was that I was pushed for time.  It was not possible to discuss all the ambiguities in the amount of time allowed.  The method the book suggested was just not possible in the context of my three-hour bluebook exam.  There was no way I could explore all the ambiguities on the exam the way the authors suggest.   Another problem I have with the book is that it is not really giving you any special advice.  Reduced to a sentence, the authors are just telling you not to be conclusory with your answers--in other words, show that certain items in the fact pattern could be argued multiple ways.  This is hardly novel law school exam advice worth $22.00!   I have read reviews by people who claim that this book helped them make law review or whatever.  I also know many people who have read this book and have gotten below average law school grades.  I do not think that this book will make a difference in how anyone does in law school.  If you are one of those people who has to read everything, because you don't want your classmates to have read something you haven't read, then by all means read this.  If, on the other hand, you are concerned about using your time effectively, then you are probably better off working on your outlines or reviewing your lecture notes rather than wasting your time reading this book.  
 I didn't find this book helpful, and here's why:  My 10 year old daughter tends to over eat and crave unhealthy foods, so I'm working on educating her on nutrition and keeping her active.  I thought this book looked like a good resources, but the problem is that it looks like a young child's book, even though it contains good information in the second half, appropriate to an older child.  So, my 10 year old took one look at it, declared it a 'baby's book' (because the cover and art and first pages look like it's designed for a very young child), and I couldn't get her further in it, because she prides herself on now being able to read 'big kid' (chapter type) books.  The packaging/art approach just don't match the level of the content 
 Not only is this book a poor choice to learn from, but it also is not suitable as a reference for Differential Equations.  As a student who is used to learning math material primarily by reading the book, I have found this textbook far below average.  Each chapter begins with a brief explanation that consists mostly of formal proofs.  I don't mind having formal proofs if there is also intuitive explanations, which this book lacks.  For the most part, the authors of the book don't seem too eager to actually have the student understand the material.  The examples are a little more helpful but usually the authors skip steps or don't even solve the problem the whole way threw almost as if the they want the reader to try to figure EVERYTHING out on his or her own.  This, in my opinion, is not the best way to teach this math 
 So I've got a bookstore, and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up. So why is it that I see so many positive reviews here? Myself, I thought the authentic feel was a definite plus, (much of the time I did feel that I was reading an ancient memoir) but as for being "a page turner," as somebody else called it, you've got to be joking. This book is one of the slowest novels I've ever read. I did it on audio book and I kept falling asleep. It was a lot like sitting in Driver's Ed. after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus. Creighton has written some pretty fun stuff, some of it even mildly thought provoking, but his is neither. Timeline and the two Jurassic Park books fit well into the whole "roller coaster of a book" thing, and personally I thought Sphere was great.  I realize that there isn't too much in the way of popular Viking fiction out there and so I suppose if you've got to have a Valhalla fix you could check this out, but I'd still recommend the Kirk Douglas movie "Vikings" over this book. Or maybe the book "Grendel" by John Gardener, which is based on the same epic poem. But this book just feels to much like a boring history lesson. 
 If you are looking for boring, lifeless adult contemporary music, then this CD is for you.  If you are looking for a great guitar CD, this isn't it.  I had such high hopes for this CD after the Robert Johnson CDs and the Cream reunion, but all winning streaks must come to an end, and Clapton's comes to a screeching halt with this.  Of all the Eric Clapton CDs that I like, this isn't one of them.  I'm glad Clapton is now in a happy place (and deservedly so), but this CD just doesn't do it for me 
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 I bought this for my SciFi class.  We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film.  It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach.  Everyone was so disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.  Bela Lugosi is a much better bet.  For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans 
 We received this book as a gift for our 3 yr old.  I read it to her and it was really disturbing.  Other reviews have noted that it must be read "in context" as far as the time it was written.  I disagree - when was a child's viewing a mother's brutal murder (Babar seeing his mother being shot before his eyes)  ever appropriate fare for a little child?  Then, Babar has to run for his life and later on in the book, there is another death.  Also, Babar is surprised when his cousins have no clothes - this is upsetting to him.  I find it offensive - elephants don't need to be like people - they don't need clothes.  I don't see the charm in this book at all.  I don't see the attraction.  One thing -- Babar marrying his cousin is the one thing that is not shocking - its not like incest, like brother and sister or like they grew up together -- people have been marrying cousins for thousands of years - up until at least the beginning of this century - hardly immoral 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 It is interesting to note that this is not a very good book. After considering the novel's premise, one would think that it would prove as entertaining as any of Mercedes Lackey's books. Lackey, an author who has developed that exacting balance necessary to romantic fantasy, writes here in her new Five Hundred Kingdoms universe, which was, in The Fairy Godmother, so sly, ironic and engaging.   That encouragement seemed cemented by a quick skim through the first few pages, which established that the characters in her sophomoric effort are those reliable archetypes that Lackey has perfected. Princess Andromeda of Acadia, has a kind and generous heart that shines through her shy, bookish exterior; a perfectly flawed heroine. Andromeda's antagonists are her mother, the Queen Cassiopeia, and the queen's adviser, both of whom demonstrate the lewd ambition of most of Lackey's most effective villains. As they plot to cheat Princess Andromeda of her rightful place (one is reminded, often, of Lackey's subtler The Black Swan), Andromeda finds herself allied with an unlikely Champion and a surprising love interest, and summons within her the strength to fight back against the traitors to the crown.  From this brief synopsis, the reader can determine that there is nothing groundbreaking in One Good Knight. That is not necessarily a fault. But what one slowly comes to understand in this, the latest variation of Lackey's perfected formula, is its utter lack of charm. Lackey seemed unable to find in herself the slightest enthusiasm in any of her favorite constructions. Her villains laid manipulative traps for the heroine, only for them to be forgotten shortly after. The reasoning behind most of the characters' actions never developed. And aimless descriptions dragged on as her heroes drifted together, seemingly without real motivation.   By the time the romantic thread of the story was clumsily resolved, one could only stare, wide-eyed, at what could only be the most falsely bland conclusion that Lackey (or any author outside of the romance shelves) has ever wrought. How could any author genuinely enjoy her characters and still lump them together so indifferently? The passionless union of the two couples, not to mention the utter confusion of the "climactic" battle, leaves the reader perplexed. His confusion is not aided by what may be the most mediocre final line ever to span a paperback's page.  There can be no argument: this book is neither original nor well-written. The only place where opinions may disagree is with whether this novel is a misstep, and not a growing trend, in Mercedes Lackey's prolific career 
 I love a great escape and a good story.  This was none of the above.  It reminded me of dull elevator chat that you aren't really paying attention to anyway.    Rarely can I not finish a book, but that's not the case with this one.  
 I first picked up on the Anita Blake series a little over a year ago. I was absolutely enthralled. Not only was the main character witty, intelligent, and kick-butt, but there was a memorable set of supporting characters to see her through. Who can forget Zerbrowski's antics (even in the worst of times) or the cold-hearted killing of everyone's favorite bounty hunter? After reading my share of the books and floating around to some of the other reviews here on Amazon, I am left wondering the same thing many of the other fans are: what happened?  I just finished Narcissus in Chains. Normally when I finish a book, I'm left with a sense of fulfillment, like I've accomplished something. Unfortunately, that was not the case. I've always found this series to capture me from the get-go, but trying to convince myself to read this one was hard. Not only was the plot rather weak, but Anita seemed to keep on debating the same situations over and over. Jean-Claude, Richard, Micah, and even Asher seem to plague her thoughts. And although she will do anything to save a member of her pard, or anyone else for that matter, her focus always seemed to drift back to the boys. And did anyone else notice the repetitiveness in the writing? Hamilton used the exact same wording for certain feelings or actions throughout the book. Unlike the earlier part of the series, the writing in Narcissus in Chains is less imaginative and less memorable. On top of it all, come the end of the book, we have this bad guy who I can't even remember where he came from in the first place!  My favorite part of the books has always been Anita's police work. I am honestly ten times more interested in her career than I am in her love life. I miss having a tight, intense plot that flows, instead of drifting around like some kid with a short attention span. And as pointed out in the book, the charming Anita Blake we used to know and love really has become a monster. A literary disaster of a monster.  Although the reviews for Cerulean Sins are probably just as grim as the reviews for Narcissus in Chains, I plan to go ahead and continue the series. I can't give up on something that has such great potential, and from the sound of it, this next one has a more recognizable plot. I can only hope. Unfortunately, I believe that Obsidian Butterfly was probably the last of one of the best series and best characters ever created 
 This is a tough read.  He gets so bogged down in the details that I forgot what I was reading about 
 I would have given this one star, but watching the one girl who can't do any of the exercises is pretty funny.  She's completely inept, and I don't know how she got chosen.  I guess she was willing to be filmed nude, so that was good enough.  Otherwise, this video is (poor).  The lighting is horrible and the camera angles are bad.  Very amateurish.  Definitely recommend Totally Nude Aerobics over this one.  That video is much higher quality, has better looking women, and they all can do the exercises.  The only problem (well, only a problem depending on how you look at it) with that one is that there are a lot of close-ups and no instruction, so if you're actually looking for an aerobics tape, you'll be out of luck.  But I don't think the main audience is actually looking for an exercise video 
 Buyers beware of the hardback version of E. P Thompson's classic work "The Making of the English Working Class". Firstly, note that the hardback is a 1966 edition. This means that is does not have Thompson's 1968 postscript, nor his 1980 preface (it probably also misses the author's 1968 revisions, but I have not checked this). Secondly, this is not an organically produced hardback: the picture on the cover is glued on, and the spine does not have the author's name (instead, it has the name "Peter Smith" - so who the hell is Peter Smith?). All in all, a shocker for purists, or any serious scholar, made all the worse for the magnificence of the original 
 If you wish to learn something interesting re the fact that the keys of b minor and Bb major share the note D as their third, you would do far better to consult a decent recording of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata than this navel-gazing narcissistic atrocity 
 Ummm.... Why should I pay 20 dollars for this when it comes free in a 5 dollar comic book 
 This product was useless. I was trying to fix my screen and all it did was make things worse. I got a microfiber cloth and everything and nothing seemed to happen. It's not worth the money. 
 There are many new stressors on today's teens, including being the first generation being reared in a completely postmodern culture. Unfortunately, the author misses this and other more subtle cultural changes that impact  today's adolescents in a big way.  I recommend Elkind's "All Grown Up  and No Place to Go" for a more thorough critique of how society shapes  and complicates the teenage years 
 This book could be so much better if it contained *accurate* information about all the animals mentioned!  Conway needs to do adequate research before writing, and Llewellyn needs to do their editorial homework before publishing her books 
 Sewn into the hem of an eighteenth-century cloak stored away in a museum, curators in the early twenty-first century discover twelve pages of handwritten notes, in code. When eventually deciphered these pages seem to indicate that shortly before his death, Benjamin Franklin paid an unemployed dock worker a sum of money to murder, thereby silence, the lowly-born woman who had given birth to Franklin's illegitimate son William. The notes are apparently the minutes kept at a sort of judicial hearing attended in secret by Washington, Hamilton, Adams, and Madison, in order that the question of Franklin's guilt or innocence, and what to do about the accusation, be decided. Are the pages a modern forgery, an eighteenth-century hoax, or did one of the most beloved Founding Fathers truly spill blood to preserve his reputation? I wish I knew. After finishing this novel, I still don't. Lehrer wastes his first eighty pages on flimsy character building, then it's true he finds his stride for about the next hundred, but the trouble is, I'll tell you now, the ending is one of those variety that makes your head hit the table, because it's so frustrating. Books that fail to answer questions are rudely-composed. Why write what you don't finish? 
 Despite not being written on the packaging or website my HP iPaq RX3417 was compatible with this keyboard.  Unfortunatly the software supplied was extremely bad, clogging my PDA making it run very slowely. As well as this, it also flickered when in use making the settings for the keyboard very difficult to change.  In terms of hardware, I found the size and position of keys to be the biggest problem. While targus does include all 5 rows of a standard keyboard, it shrinks the top row (numbers) and the bottom row (space bar). This makes it very difficult to use the space bar (which is for some reason split into three parts) and the numbers (which could have been made full size as there is nothing else in the way). I found myself constantly not hitting the right key or not hitting the right key hard enough for the key to register. In terms of key position, there is a gap between the keys on the left side and right side of the keyboard making hitting the keys in the middle very difficult. Some keys are also very small (e.g. the right shift key and backspace) making them difficult to use (strange considering they are used a lot on keyboards).  One of the biggest problems I had with the keyboard was the lack of proper arrow keys. Targus includes an oval shaped four direction button that controls a mouse cursor that appears on the screen. This mouse cursor is useful, but needs to be supplemented with normal Up, Down, Left and Right keys which are needed when typing to go back to another part of the document. Using the mouse to do this is very frustrating.  The final negative thing about this keyboard was the price. I paid AUD$149.95 for this keyboard. Doing some research on the internet found better models (i.e. Think Outside Stowaway IR Keyboard) available for less than half the price (around AUD$70) and bluetooth keyboards available for less than AUD$190. I think it might be about time Targus releases a new model PDA keyboard with a design and software that are suitable for the use the keyboard will get. No more tiny keys and no more than two space bars 
 Santayana is known broadly as the guy who said that those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it -- whatever that means. And therein lies, in miniature, the charm of this tireless windbag, most of whose vast output is thankfully out of print. The statement in itself means precisely nothing, and its perfect emptiness is what renders it most useful. It requires a trememdous volume of ignorance to make Santayana profound, which is, I suppose, why he was for so long America's national philosopher. If you expect philosophers to be blowhards, then Santayana will never disappoint you. For the rest of us, instead of this volume and the five-volume bolus of which it is the condensate, one can read William James' essay "The Sentiment of Rationality," the wisdom of which it, as it were, repeats 
 CD album not what I thought it was....Of course PB plays a mouth harp.....of course, the songs sometimes all sound alike...that is why he's not a ZZ, BB or whatever. One maybe two songs on these 2 cd's I like.....the rest go in file 13. There's nothing wrong with this style of music but it falls far short of Buddy Guy, BB King, Albert King....I am/was relunctant to negative any musician and this is not the case....Many of his good songs are missing and "fillers" placed instead. Unless you are a whipping Paul Butterfield fan, keep looking..... 
 After consuming everything Hillerman has written, and learning something new about Native American culture from each book, and after Hillerman's squib on the Dust jacket, my expectations were set so far above what this trite book delivered that even two stars seems kind... As a 1/8 Arapaho [& 1/8 Blackfoot] i had hoped to learn something about their life.  The characterizations were also paper thin, including both the male and female protagonists... and the denouement was telegraphed for miles... ergo, even as a mystery/suspense novel, this one flunked 
 I do not know why Stephen King let this trash be made. Read the short story instead and avoid this film 
 What a chore this book was to read.  If it weren't for my OCD about finishing books that I start, I would've read the first couple of chapters and then given up.  It seems like a wannabe-suspense, but it's not.  It seems like there might be a love story in it, but there's not.  It feels like there might be a creepy angle in it, but there is not.  What I can gather about this book is that the author thinks she's going to connect all these people with different circumstances and perspectives together by one tragedy.  She tries to make a connection, but falls WAY short.  Read Vinegar Hill - that one was worth it.  Pass Midnight Champagne by 
 I purchased this book -- unfortunately before I read the reviews here -- to prepare for the CISA. Despite the optimistic title, the book fails to deliver in just about every area. The book is not connected to the exam in any logical form or structure. One of the biggest draws for a book like this is the practice test software. Sadly, this book fails yet again. The software works, but the questions in some cases are just plain wrong! I wrote to the editor and they offered me an errata sheet that I could use to spot mistakes in their data???? What good is that? My advice is that you skip this book, avoid this author, and not patronize this publisher since they are not willing to make good on their promises 
 A stunningly bad exercise in stupidity.  The book was both poorly reasoned and poorly written.  The authored failed to support their "argument" with even the most rudimentary analysis and quantitative evidence.  In addition, they completely failed to place their loose ideas into context and apparently have no understanding of history.  To wit: A poll tax on voting?  Um, excuse me?  Have you no education in the history of voting oppression and the fight for civil rights in history 
 How can a collection featuring Yma Sumac, Townes Van Zandt, Nina Simone and Moondog get only 2 stars, because of Kenny Rogers & the 1st Edition. This version of the song sucks, and the scene in the movie sucked. Edit this self indulgant dreck out of both and they rate higher 
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 "The Door In The Floor" is difficult to like, even, (or perhaps especially), if you're a fan of John Irving's book, "A Widow For One Year," which was the source of this film.   The movie is dark, depressing, & slow-moving. It also showcases the least likable characters from the book. To make matters worse, it focuses only on the first third of the novel's story, which leaves us with an entire movie about an alienated, (& alienating), couple's suffering. The film is completely devoid of the novel's interesting & more enjoyable journey through this tragic period of a family's life & into the more fulfilling chapters in the lives of characters who aren't well developed in the film, but who are central to the book's satisfying end to an otherwise hopelessly sad story!   This may give you an idea why the film wasn't very successful with audiences.   The theme is of deep personal loss and the devastating effects it can have on people. Unfortunately, the film version of the story concentrates almost entirely on the agony experienced by the parents, played by Jeff Bridges & Kim Basinger, in the aftermath of the accidental death of their two teenage sons. It wallows in the empty chasm that's grown between them & delves into the sad, meaningless, & even cruel love affairs they each engage in, in vain attempts to ease their sorrows & escape the pain of the love lost between them & of course, the greatest loss, the loss of their sons. The film also highlights the rather ugly way this couple inflicts damage upon the people they use for this purpose.   And finally, we witness the pain of their very young daughter, who was born out of yet more of the parent's attempts to fill their empty, sad lives, and we're treated to a view of her pitiful childhood, growing up with parents who truly "aren't there."   The greatest mystery for me is why the screenwriter chose to tell just a small slice of the story of this great novel, and even worse, why they chose to "bring to life" only the most depressing and frankly least interesting parts of it! If the theme of loss is one you're very interested in, you might find this movie quite affecting.  As for me, a great fan of the book, I can only hope that someday someone makes a better & more complete adaptation of this great book. It's not nearly as desperate & sad a story as this film version!  On subsequent viewings I've grown to appreciate this film a bit more. Taken completely apart from the novel, it's not a "bad" film. Undoubtedly, the performances are wonderful, however little fun they are to watch. 
 Creationist A: Boy, am I getting frustrated.  The evolutionists have an incredible amount to evidence that's really hard to refute.  I mean, WE true believers know they're wrong, but to the general public, let's face it, the evolutionist case just looks too good.  They got TONS of science on their side. What can we do?  Creationist B: How about this. Why don't we get someone to write a book that says there are complex biological features that could not evolve because the parts they're made up of couldn't function alone.   CA: But haven't we already tried that dozens of times in various ways?  I mean, the evolutionists have always said that looking at complex end products doesn't tell the full story.  And you gotta admit, that makes sense.  I mean, the whole point they make is that biological features evolve in a slow, step by step process over huge spans of time, one small change at a time. In the meantime, they say, the transitional forms could become extinct, making it seem like a complex form came out of nowhere. Like I said, this is frustrating.  CB: You're missing the point.  I know a guy who's a biochemist.  He can write up something using all the technical jargon.  He can even get into things like genetics and DNA and all that stuff and make it sound really convincing. I mean, it's not gonna fool biologists or biochemists but let's face it, THEY aren't the ones we're trying to fool.  We'll call it "intelligent design" instead of "creationism" .  We'll try to make it sound like it's something new.  People won't know what to think. When they see it on bookstore shelves, a lot of people might just think it's actually a legitimate science book.  What are they gonna do?  Go out and take advanced university courses in biology and chemistry to find out for themselves?  They're gonna think it's real.  CA: I get it. You just want to deliberately create confusion among the general public by writing over their heads, even if you know what you've written is garbage.  CB.  Precisely.  CA: Very sneaky!  I like the way you think.  Let's just hope those people don't bother to look at other sources of information.  They might just find out this ID stuff is baloney.  CB:  Shhh!!!  You'll give it away!! 
 Leon R. Kass, M.D., P.h.D., is chairman of the 'President' George W. Bush's Council on Bioethics. This book was intelligently written without any reference to religion but the whole underlying message was "Do not touch Gods property even if it means healing the sick." These religious fundamentalists will do anything to STUNT us in our pursuits of happiness. This guy is for KEEPING PARALYZED PEOPLE PARALYZED. "Dr." Kass is for KEEPING AMPUTEES AMPUTATED. He's for KEEPING the depressed and suicidal DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL. Ill spare you the bull and say what Dr. Kass really wants to say - "I want you to follow Jesus with all your heart no matter how much pain and suffering you are in. If God made you depressed than thats how you should be. If God made you paralyzed then thats how you should be. If you are miserable in your existance then thats obviously how God wants you to be and thats how you will be with our new conservative laws that will effectively ban progress to help people". For this is the ONLY real argument you can use to support the banning of progress designed to help humans. - He wants everyone to follow the 'divine' rule of sanctity of life, not quality of life - an ugly ethic for a very stupid man. 
 The trust a young reader places in a writer is something to appreciate and value. Many young readers have been following this promising series for several years and have paid the writer with their return through a dozen books and waiting for the conclusion to this saga. The writer has commited the ultimate betrayal to his young readers in delivering this last book. The book is poorly written and reveals a very undisciplined writer. Perhaps it was too much success-too soon, or an editor who rushed this last book to publishing which led to this fiasco. It is disappointing that the writer did not value the many young minds who waited for the conclusion. The rambling shows the control of an alcoholic and the shoddy conclusion reveals a lack of creativity. It is clear that he did not give enough time and thought to develop something with more control and imagination. It is sad that many children will approach other serial writers skeptically after this miserable ending to the miserable series 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 This book speculates about both the advance of computer technology in the 21st century and the socio-political response to it.  Although it is peppered with a few interesting notions worth skimming, much of the speculation is unreasonable and philosophically naive.  In the first chapter, Kurzweil attempts to lay a sort of theoretical framework for his speculations, which boils down to his belief that Moore's Law is just one instance of a cosmic principle of exponential advance which explains everything from the first second of the universe after the Big Bang to the evolution of life on Earth and now the evolution of technology.  The second chapter argues that it is possible for an intelligence to create something more intelligent than itself:  just as evolution "intelligently" created us, we will (soon!) create computers which will build machines of far greater cognitive ability than us.  It is indeed intriguing to consider that someday machines will outperform humans in many ways, but the book to this point is best skimmed, because there's actually very little substance and a lot of dry, pseudo-intellectual filler.  Chapter 3 examines the philosophical problem that is going to be brought to the forefront by super-advanced computers:  what is consciousness, and can machines possess it?  Kurzweil unimpressively touches on a handful of schools of thought here (his sentences on Descartes made me wonder if he has read anything on the subject besides pop philosophy), though he does not try to decide between them.  Instead, his prediction is social:  eventually machines will be accepted as real people -- just as real people will physically merge with technology -- even if that sounds bizarre to us now.  This theme comes up again and again, and it proves to be one of the only thought-provoking issues of the book.  Chapters 4 and 5 talk about the field of artificial intelligence, where it has been, and where it needs to go.  In a section entitled "The Formula for Intelligence", Kurzweil provides his recipe for the strong AI of the future:  recursion, neural nets, and genetic algorithms -- all taking hints from the reverse engineering of the human brain.  This wishful thinking is one of the Achilles' heels of this book.  For a software entrepreneuer, Kurzweil is strangely blind to the evidence:  software is hardly becoming more complex or "intelligent" at all, let alone exponentially.  Today's software systems are perhaps bigger but not significantly "smarter" than systems of past decades, and software quality continues to barely meet the lowest of expectations.  Despite Moore's Law and the faith that it will continue to provide more and more cycles in the hardware world, progress in the world of software seems, to this software engineer of 15 years, to be nearly a flat line, not an exponential curve.  Just compare how many hundreds of man-years have gone into the lastest version of Windows, versus what it would take to design and implement Kurzweil's ideal of software that is able to write more powerful software.  Part of the problem may be that Kurzweil simply ignores the fields of cognitive psychology and epistemology, which are in their infancy.  He does not seem to even be aware of the issues in these fields which would have to be solved (probably by geniuses) in order to create "strong AI."  Instead, the solutions he predicts are purely materialistic:  brain deciphering, massively parallel hardware, and genetic algorithms.  Part 2 of the book focuses on potential technologies.  The most powerful computers he speculates about are quantum computers, and he doesn't waste any time before asserting that someday we will be able to download the entirety of a brain into a quantum computer, so that the computer will in effect have a clone of that person's mind.  Kurzweil, in his materialism, does not seem to even be aware that there is a philosophical argument that this is impossible.  He also speculates about nanotechnologies and how they will eventually give us a unprecented ability to manipulate physical reality.  Part 3 of the book is comprised of specific predictions for 2009, 2019, 2029, and 2099.  This book was written in 1999, and we can already see that some of his 2009 predictions are either just simple extensions of things we were starting to see in 1999, while others wildly miss the mark, such as:  "the majority of reading is done on displays", "the majority of text is created using continuous speech recognition", and "intelligent roads are in use, primarily for long-distance travel."  That Kurzweil could be so far off in his 10 year predictions does not bode well for his 20-, 30-, and 100-year predictions.  Indeed, his predictions for 2019 sound like a science fiction novel, and of the ones that sound plausible I think he must be off by at least 30 years.  His speculations for 2029 are just fantastic.  In general he seems to "predict" based on the assumption that new technologies will be deployed as soon as they are available, underestimating a myriad of resisting factors:  legal, political, social, market, scientific, etc.  Ultimately this book can be fun for skimming and raises a couple of thought-provoking issues, but as speculating about technology more than 10 years in the future is necessarily a foolish activity, there's plenty of foolishness to be found in here 
 I loved Rose in "Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman" and was looking forward to reading more about her. However, Rose doesn't put in an appearance until almost halfway through this book. It's all about Minty, the second wife. I found this book disappointing and light on the plot that the first book had. 
 I owned a Salton 3 for All over 10 years old. I thought that with the purchase of this Krups unit I'd be moving up in the world. Boy was I disappointed. The steamer has a detachable nozzle which frequently pops off while frothing milk, splattering everything nearby. The Salton had a 4 shot capacity while this makes only 2 shots at a time, and weaker at that. The Salton for its $99 price included a carafe and steamer jug. You'll have to purchase these separately from Krups. Krups recommends purchase of a separate water filter for the water reservoir for the espresso unit. When it's in place the pump can't draw water through it. I brew espresso every morning. I don't understand how anyone could rate this product favorably if they reguarly make espresso. However the coffee unit works well. I've never written a review for Amazon before. The poor quality of this product motivated me 
 I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!   Unsatisfied customer 
 A bit of context: I am an intermediate photographer recently introduced to digital SLR through the purchase of a Nikon D70.  I am well-versed in general photographic knowlege and the theories behind color management and light in the context of digital photography.  I purchased this book hoping that it would help me to understand enough about color management to at least start asking the right questions about how to apply color management to my setup.  I became so frustrated with it that I've had to stop reading it several times just to collect myself.  In no particular order, the book is flawed in the following ways:  * It is not well written.  I stumble over poor writing more than the average reader, but this book simply had too much akward prose and was overly conversational.  Unfortunately, this poor writing was more than just a distraction: important points were frequently lost to unclear writing. * Full of marginally useful examples.  The author provides step-by-step instructions for numerous software programs (and a few pieces of hardware too) that are completely useless for those of us who don't have the software (or hardware). * Many "tips" revealed to be unimportant.  One of my biggest pet peeves was that on several occassions the author provided lengthy explantions of processes, features, or concepts, only to wrap up his discussion with "but all of this isn't really important, so you don't need to worry about it." * Poor organization.  The book could have benefited significantly from a reorganization around those tasks that the average reader was likely to try to do.  I found myself finishing the book still unclear where to even start thinking about my color management setup, and with basic questions still unanswered. * Meaningless examples.  The author provides (some very striking) images in support of his ideas, but many are not directly related his points (single images with captions like "Professional photographer X uses color management to make sure that the colors he sees on his screen are the same as those on the final print")  I give it two stars instead of one because there is some useful information in the text -- it's just incredibly hard to find amid all of the clutter 
 Is it me or did the author of the book in question most likely write that last review? The writer ran out and bought 5 copies to give to his friends? You have got to be kidding me.  I haven't read the book, it may very well be good, but I highly doubt that last review was by someone that is not connected somehow to profiting by this books sales.  I have read Giuliano's books before and have enjoyed them, but he is seen with such skepticism by most who know anything about the Beatles that I find it hard to believe that anyone not connected to the book would dish out such over the top praise as the last review.  
 The book is actually rather short, less than 200 pages. But the book might have been better received by me if it were an article. First off, Bartov includes too many sources and excerpts most of which demonstrate the same point, over and over.  Additionally most of the excerpts were not necessarily of exception quality, which meant the reader reads account after account of the same type of entries about ideology or the horror of war. At one point, it was just better to read only one excerpt and skip the rest.  Bartov also just simply doesn't convince me of his thesis. In the last three chapters, there were so many excerpts I simply forgot what he was trying to prove. And when he did go back to his ideas, he would suddenly make, in my opinion, great leaps of logic.  After a few excepts he might say something like, that demonstrated that the soldiers were completely indoctrinated in Nazi ideology.  Well, I'm not so convinced because even though they were fed propaganda, who is to say they didn't already have their predispositions and prejudices against "jewish bolschevism," before joining the army, and more importantly, before Hitler even came to power?  He also concludes at the end that the Germans removed themselves from hitler and made themselves victims and that, so-to-speak, "others" committed the crimes of WWII, whether it be on the east front or Holocaust. Regardless of whether or not that's true, the conclusion came seemingly out of nowhere and I have a hard time believing his statement, because he doesn't explain it.  He doesn't explain how they remove themselves, etc.    Lastly, this is probably just a pet peeve, but I hate how random german words pop up in excerpts and in the text that aren't translated, but others are. He talks about an author having heard a veteran in a "german Kneipe," but didn't bother translating it to bar.  Or in my translated texts, he leaves some german phrases in brackets. I just find it redundant and at the very least, inconsistent.  The first chapter, however, is a rather good description of "demodernization on the front," and worth reading. The rest of it is rather, mediocre 
 The author is not an expert on jade at all. Features pieces from own private collection and some of the descriptions are obviously inaccurate (eg. Goddess of Mercy holding a fly swatter???!!!). Would give it -ve stars if possible. I am also aghast that the publishers did not have more rigorous standards 
 This book is dated; the law changes at least one a month, sometimes more often. Your examiner doesn't live or work in the past or regard out-dated laws as useful tools for business. You will never know what is current, right or wrong when you trust a dated law book. NO. NO, NO, NO, GET SOMETHING NEWER 
    After viewing the history channels' decoding the past segment on Islam and reading  endless historic accounts of Islam (and all other religions) I find Esposito a dangerous academic with blinders to the truth mysteriously attached to his head. The atrocities of Islamic AND Christian leaders are there for anyone to read...it is tempting to cave into Carl Sagans Godless void but somehow it doesn't fit......who would I pray to?? I feel Christs' new testament was pretty close to correct but he still had that "Lake of fire" and "eye for an eye" thing....good Koran material that.     I really think that most muslims and many christians are sadly brainwashed and quick to feed off their own self righteousness. Islam, as the "fastest growing religion" is particularly scary though. I see similarities to the "big lie" of the third reich clear as day. Just watch the footage of the recent 30th anniversary (of Khomeni) in Iran recently and then watch some film of the Nuremberg rallies of the 1930s'. Yeah I know the decadent west  isn't representative of good morals but the vast majority that don't make the media ARE good MORAL people who don't profess to know all the answers but insist on the freedom to persue progress and truth. Islam ain't the answer unless you think the middle ages were a good thing.  
 Not to put too fine a point on it but this book is DRY - almost like a text book.  There is very little action and/or suspense brought forth about involvement in the Angola operation and what could have been was quickly blunted with operational and bureaucratic detail.  And that's how the book drags on, with excruciating detail. In one part, Mr. Stockwell describes what he did to finally get a desk to work from at Langley by sitting in the hall in everyone's way and stacking his papers up beside him.  What took him pages to describe should've been done in a simple paragraph.  To be fair, the book is written from the viewpoint of an intelligence staffer not a cloak and dagger operative. Yes, there might be some interest in how inefficient the CIA was operating back in the mid-1970s but that's true for most large government organizations. He also describes some of the "political" machinations between officials within the CIA.  Again, mildly interesting but nothing notable. Some of the descriptions of dialog and reactions of persons seems contrived, almost as if he (or some ghost writer) added these things for effect. It almost "reads" like a fiction novel in that respect. Rather than writing a solid, crisp account with thoughtful and concise opinions about CIA policy and inner workings the book devolves often times into monotonous detail. However, in the latter chapters the account does get more interesting as he discusses "plausible deniability" and the deception of the CIA to "hide" their involvement. One of the more interesting parts is the organizational background and resources needed to run an operation of this type including the shipping of weapons and ammo, the propaganda strategy, the political workings thru committees, the State Department and the President to gain support, etc.  The book does makes one wonder what other rebellions or conflicts the CIA was involved in over the last 30-40 years and is an eye opener about our nations espionage policies. On this level, the book succeeds.  But, in the end the book was almost a grind to finish.  I'd only recommend this one for the hard core 'spook' fan 
 Michelle Malkin's pathetic excuse for journalism is disgusting. Purchasing this racist, biased, terrible thing she calls a book will only feed her to continue. She has posted numerous stories with outright racist remarks and it's gross. Pathetic at the most. Her "blog" online is a prime example of that.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOO 
 This is a very difficult item to construct.  It has many pieces and lousy instructions.  Unless you are an expert at constructing flat pack - my advice is dont buy this item 
 I recently watched this and was very disappointed. I really love the music of Blackmore's Night. I have almost all of their CDs. But, having stated all of that, I just could not tolerate the poor sound production values. All of the vocals were distant and muddy. It sounded like the mikes were placed about 50 feet back in the audience. If I hadn't been familiar with these songs, I would had no idea of the lirics. There is no reason not to take the audio from the mixing board. This would have resulted in much better sound values. In all, I was not pleased 
 The sound quality on the DVD was atrocious.  Too bad, given the great Burt Bacharach score 
 I guess I only finished it becuase I always finish a book I start reading (especially if I paid for it).  It was so hard to read, the style is tiring, resembling a ranting inner dialogue more than a book on an economic category, even iof it is from a cultural and anthropological perspective!  At the end of the day I can say I know what Aztecs used for money (and how they tortured children to death as children's tears were considered some sort of "rain magic". damn, I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW THAT!!!) and that coins were invented by Lydians (and a number of simiral pieces of information) but I also have a HEADACHE and am feeling frustrated and nauseated and extremely unhappy.  I don't think that is how you are supposed to feel after reading a book on history of money! I don't feel informed or enlightened at all. Having read other people's reviews I guess accuracy of information presented (unless it refers to social or cultural aspects of money) might also be problematic?!  
 I received this magazine as a gift... and I will not renew. Articles are very short and refer you to websites, telephone numbers, etc. for more information. Why so little information in the magazine itself? Additionally, there is a load of advertising: take that out of the equation and the magazine would only be a few pages long. For my money, there is much more available elsewhere, including a "google" search. Waste of paper, IMHO 
 Despite careful aiming, this has exactly, and I mean exactly, the same signal strength as my cheapie $6 Airlink 7db omni, and is weaker than my homemade Pirouline cantenna. Probably not a bad antenna if you can pick it up cheap, but save your money if you're expecting 15db performance 
 I ordered this item several months ago and its yet to arrive 
 I can't give her a half a star? Yep, I heard Me'shell for the first time in quite awhile on XM Radio just recently. Her new jazz album is being featured alot lately, which is too bad, because I like Beyond Jazz on XM, but I have to turn to a different channel everytime I hear that dreadful sax player she's got playing with her. If you like "stress-free" jazz, definately stay away from this one. I like Me'Shell from back-in-the-day! 
 I think that if you are into literature than you might like this book but I think that it wasnt as great as my professor said it was going to b 
 "My edition of Demanding the Impossible was published in 1992 by HarperCollins Publishers. On p.561, Marshall writes that:    David Friedman sees such agencies as both brokers of mini- social contracts and producers of 'laws' which conform to the market demand for rules to regulate commerce. Each person would be free to subscribe to a protective association of his choice, since 'Protection from coercion is an economic good.' Apart from adumbrating The Machinery of Freedom (1973), Friedman has popularized Hayek's defense of capitalism as the best antidote to the serfdom of collectivism in books with such self-explanatory titles as Capitalism and Freedom (1962) and Free to Choose (1979).  The true author of Capitalism and Freedom and Free to Choose is of course Milton Friedman, David Friedman's non-anarchist father. Milton Friedman is not mentioned in the two preceding pages of the chapter; and in any case "Friedman" clearly is meant to refer to David Friedman. (Nor is Milton Friedman in the index or bibliography of the book, although at least Milton Friedman's books are omitted from the bibliography rather than attributed to David Friedman's authorship a second time.)   This error is so egregious that the reader can only conclude that Peter Marshall presumes to write about books that he has never even seen the cover of, much less read. Whether Marshall corrected it in a subsequent edition, or whether the error was simply corrected by the transcriber of the widely available Internet exerpt , I do not know. But even if the correction was Marshall's, for this kind of error to have made it into a published book speaks volumes.   On the same page, Marshall writes that:   The writings of Ayn Rand, a refugee from the Soviet Union, best represent the intellectual background to the new right-wing libertarianism in the United States. In her The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism (1964), she attempted a philosophical defence of egoism while in her novels she portrayed a superior individual fighting the forces of collectivism, particularly in the form of the State. Her superior individual, driven by a Nietzschean will to power, appears in the guise of a capitalist entrepreneur who is presented as the source of all wealth and the creator of all progress. Rand claimed that she had a direct knowledge of objective reality, and her 'Objectivist' movement had a considerable vogue in the sixties. Like most anarcho-capitalists, she is convinced of the truth of her own views, which to others appear mere dogma.  And in my edition, the paragraph immediately ends. The next paragraph begins, "Amongst anarcho-capitalist apologists, the economist Murray Rothbard is probably the most aware of the anarchist tradition."   Again, this outrageous error has been corrected in the Internet excerpt of Demanding the Impossible. But it provides additional proof that Peter Marshall presumes to write about books and authors that he has never read. Ayn Rand's attack on anarcho-capitalism (in "The Nature of Government," one essay in her The Virtue of Selfishness) is so clear that Marshall could only make this error by failing to have even read the author whose views he is describing.   These are only two of Marshall's numerous factual errors which demonstrate a shocking lack of basic standards of scholarship. After all, a book is not a Usenet posting; one is supposed to spend months or years in study, fact-checking, re-writing, and so on.   Some similar errors appear in Ulrike Heider's Anarchism: Left, Right and Green. Once again, there are errors so gross that the only possible explanation is that Heider presumes to write about books she has never read.   A few examples of her poor scholarship:    "Menger is considered the founder of the Austrian School of Economics, which continued to refine its theory of monetary value until the middle of the 20th century. The most prominent descendent of this school of thought is is monetarist Milton Friedman, the economic authority for such politicians as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and others." Anarchism: Left, Right, and Green, p.100.  Milton Friedman is not and never has had any affiliation with the Austrian School. In fact, he is the most famous member of the rival Chicago School, which even a minimal study of the differences between free-market economists would have revealed.   "If it weren't for their obsession with work and their misanthropic outlook, one might mistake Rand's heroes for left-wing bohemians. They are always Anglo-Saxon Americans." ibid, p.105  Francisco d'Anconia, one of the four major heroic characters in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is of South American nationality.   "Roark's rival, the mediocre architect Peter Keaton..."ibid  The character's name is in fact Peter Keating. While the error is trivial, it does indicate that Heider sees no need to get the basic facts straight when she discusses a book. The Fountainhead is divided into four sections, each named for one major character; "Peter Keating" is the title of the first section. It would be very hard to miss, unless you never read the book (or wrote from memory years afterwards).   Reversing her previous confusion about the Austrian vs. the Chicago schools of economics, Heider appears to attribute monetarist policy prescriptions to Rothbard: "The monetarist road out of such misery must lead through a depression, the 'painful but necessary process by which the free market rids itself of the excesses and errors of the boom.' [quotation Rothbard's] Rothbard recommends that the government do the exact opposite of what the Keynesians suggest: it should simply abandon its policy of inflation by giving the free market reign and by reinstating the gold standard." ibid, p.131.  Again, Rothbard spent the better part of his academic career attacking monetarism and the Chicago school of economics with which monetarism is associated.  I have been informed by admirers of Murray Bookchin that Heider's work contains similar gross errors about eco-anarchism. Since this is not my field of expertise, I do not presume to point them out, but it would not surprise me.   It is one thing to violently disagree with an author, and to express one's disagreement in a book. It is another matter entirely to get basic facts wrong; so wrong, in fact, that it casts doubt on whether the author read the books he or she presumes to write about. "  
 I believe that this book was very poorly written. It had a slow moving plot and the ending was dull. It had a good story line but as I said it moved to slow. There is better literature to be reading 
 Thought I was sending our youngest son a birthday present.....turns out this version was not the one my husband and I listened to in the car but an abbreviated version that requires a special CD that he does not have in his car 
 I feel really bad for those poor students of Mr. Pearce who don't drop out of his class the first week.  This is the first book on public speaking that I've read where I honestly haven't taken anything from this book, and I've read about five.  He talks about all of the mechanics of public speaking, but something big is missing from this book.  Also, leadership via public speaking, which seems to be the titular topic of this book, is missing from the pages.  Mr. Pearce reminds me of one of my statistics professors.  This professor, which I'll call Mr. Banal, was a very smart person, had studied a lot, was up on the current statistics methodologies, and was a nice person.  However, Mr. Banal's lecture consisted almost entirely of an analysis of what he thought of the textbook.  Mr. Banal always had some new "insight"--which usually amounted to a very minor disagreement that he had with the author of the text.  He talked about this minor disagreement for the entire lecture hour.  I think that doing this allowed him to feel good about himself, because he was proving to the students that he was smarter than the author of the text.  This was really confusing to me.  Who should I believe, Mr. Banal or the author of the statistics text?  The author seemed a lot more interesting (which is funny considering the subject), but Mr. Banal was the one who ultimately would be testing me.  This is what Mr. Pearce does in his book.  He is constantly rewriting speeches of others into a "better speech."  A really funny example of this occurs during the end of the book, where he's quoting Anita Roddick, managing director of The Body Shop International.  Roddick is an excellent public speaker, and he quotes often from one of her speeches, which is probably the most interesting part of the book.  Toward the end, Mr. Pearce cherry picks a paragraph from her speech and reworks it.  The initial paragraph wasn't all that bad, but Mr. Pearce's "improved" version of it was terrible.  This is the same kind of difference between a sports commentator and an avid fan.  The sports commentator will describe the athlete, what the athlete did during the performance, and trace the effects of the athlete's performance.  This is very complex and requires a lot of skill.  The avid fan will say things like, "I would have done this...I would have done that."  This requires very little skill at all.  Mr. Pearce is the avid fan, telling us what he would have done, rather than actually doing anything himself.  It kind of seems like Mr. Pearce was writing this book for the dean of UC-Berkeley, rather than for the public 
 I expect a lot out of anything with a Disney association, and in many ways this does not disappoint. However, I believe it has a fatal flaw that makes it less child-friendly. I love to read with my children, but I view these read-alongs as a good alternative so our young children (3 & 5) can "read" a book on their own. However, none of these stories include cues to let a child know when to turn the page! This leaves them guessing and was a severe disappointment for all of us 
 This is a horribly miscategorized book.  While the case studies are entertaining, there is absolutely no advice on how to deal with the situations presented.  The book is sprinkled with humiliating demotivators like "When dumbness at the top insists on perpetuating itself, a miserable life for everyone else is assured."  With no solutions, the book is essentially little more than an extended gripe session, best suited for discussion over a round of drinks at your next pink slip party 
 I liked the MD671 for the home office so I thought the MD7161 would be a good upgrade for the home phone. Not so. The handsets intermittently cut out when the person on the other end is speaking. I tried all the troubleshooting recommendations with no change in the problem. If you cannot hear the entire conversation that sort of makes the phone unusable, right 
 This book has not been helpful to me in this first few months of loss.  Although it does show similarities people have in their experience of deep grief, it does not offer solutions.  Shakesphere and Poe may have had similar experiences, and may have written about them elloquently, but that doesn't help me today.  I think this book needs to be targeted to a diferent population than those of us who are looking for answers 
 This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste. 
 Since he is the famous writer and I'm just a reader, it must me be. But I find stuff written in the first person and the present time a nuisance. Having read almost all of Hiaasen's books, this one was like a cold shower. I sometimes actually doubted that he had written it himself 'cause often the phraseology is so totally not the Hiaasen I got used to 
 Hugh Farnham is a blue-collar survivalist who likes to play Bridge.  His college-age daughter Karen, her friend Barbara, his lawyer son Duke, his alcoholic wife Grace, and house servant Joe are playing cards at his house the night the bombs hit.  Everyone scrambles to safety inside Hugh's modern bomb shelter.  As the bombs fall and his wife is passed out, Hugh starts up an affair with his daughter's friend Barbara, right in the shelter.  As if Hugh's shallowness and arrogance wasn't enough to turn you against the protagonist, this nauseating little scene will.  When the shakes and quakes finally end, the family pours from the shelter to find themselves in an impossible, pristine, clean world.  At first glance, it looks like utopia, but then as they settle into a rustic lifestyle they are suddenly set upon by an advanced race, imprisoned, and brought into a vastly different culture as slaves.  Somehow, Hugh needs to find a way to break free of the civilization they are trapped in, so that he can be free with Barbara.  Of all the Apocalypse Fiction, this book is the worst.  The protagonist is so lowbrow, so arrogant, so unlikable, so self-centered, so shallow, so immoral that he simply cannot capture any interest.  He's not even a "love to hate" person.  The dialogue is flatly emotionless and yet irritatingly flippant, and Barbara and Hugh's constant prattlings of "Darling, Dear, and Beloved" do not fit the characters.  Neither does Hugh's occasional spouting of words like "shall" and "shan't" along with racial diatribes that include heavy use of the "N" word.  There is little emotion from these one-dimensional characters even though they face the death of Hugh's daughter and Barbara's friend Karen, cannibalism, castration (Hugh cared more about his "boys" than he did his real children), pedophilia, racism, and $exual slavery, they show no more feeling than they would biting into a doughnut.  The entire plot-over-plot had a contrived and vapid feeling to it, as if the author himself didn't quite believe his story.  And if he doesn't believe, how can he expect the reader to?  Overall, there is no depth or flavor in this story at all, other than the ugly aftertaste of a musty trailer park visit in the dusty twilight, as old men drink cheap stinking whiskey and the wind blows over the city dump next door.  I recommend avoiding this book. 
 Well if you want to see Angelina Jolie young and naked in a short one time scene this is the movie to buy, if you don't then leave the movie alone it's just another teen rebelion movie 
 to call something one thing and for it to function as the exact opposite, how classically 'trickster' of you John.  This book had very few rewarding elements. The steady, lame use of hip-hop slang was so hackneyed it made me wince.  Someone tell this guy that Hip-Hop is the most dominant, most pervasive and most corporate form of popular music in history. Mr. Leland evidences scant knowledge of the indie-rock scene, and I couldn't disagree more with his glib conclusions regarding the Beat generation authors. Independent cinema is barely mentioned. This guy is a marvel of philistine co-option.  My advice is to not read this book, if you are looking for hipness-as hollow as that sounds- then read Whitman, read Kerouac, read Ginsberg, read Twain or Melville, Dostoyevsky anything but this rediculous foray.  At best its kitsch and at worst it meanders off into frivolity.   
 Writing is about more than researching. This is the worst written, worst edited book I've ever read. Scribblings from Professor Hirshson's notes - I had to stop after 76 pages 
 Reference picture quality on HD-DVD.  Basically unwatchable though.  I would not recommend the blind buy on this one.  
 When my grandson first received the game he loved it! Then he and his family had to re-locate which meant taking down the game. When they got to their new home, the game doesn't stay up like it did 
 So apparently for this flick you must not only love dogs, but bad soundtracks as well. I don't know what's going on here, but I don't like it. The CD is comprised of a mix of country songs and overused classics that need to be left alone. There's a decent song or two from artists like Ryan Adams, but a song or two can't always save an entire album. The final straw of my annoyance with this CD would have to be the last track, straight from the movie I'd imagine, where the actors get together and sing "Come On Get Happy." Maybe this is supposed to be funny.....I'm not laughing. Maybe the whole album is suppose to be funny, but to me it seems like one big, corny, Hollywood joke.  Robin Bacior Synthesis.ne 
 ONCE A BOOK BECOMES A BESTSELLER, IT BECOMES DIFFICULT TO FIND NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THAT BOOK. THIS BOOK MAYBE A BESTSELLER BUT I DON'T THINK A NON-PHYSICIST WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE AUTHOR. UNLESS ONE IS PREPARED TO EXERT ONESELF MENTALLY TO A GREAT EXTENT, ONE SHOULD NOT EVEN ATTEMPT TO READ THIS BOOK. ONE OF MY FRIENDS, WHO IS A PHYSICS UNDERGRADUATE RECOMMENDED IT TO ME. I AM A PHARMACIST AND EVENTHOUGH I LEARNT A FEW SURPRISING THINGS FROM THIS BOOK HERE AND THERE, I WAS UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND IT AND UNTIMATELY HAD TO LEAVE IT ONLY HALF-READ. 
 Don't bother.  Characters are lifeless, plot is boring, can't believe her first book is a best seller.  Maybe it was just pure luck 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 Throughout the 1990's, American popular culture was awash with frisson-producing paranoid fantasies ranging from the hit TV show, "The X Files", to accusations that the President's critics were being sytematically murdered by methods and persons unknown.  Observers began to notice what scholar Daniel Pipes called "fusion paranoia"; i.e., the blending of disparate (and sometimes wildly contradictory) elements from Christian apocalyptic rhetoric, UFOlogy, 'moral panic', millennial fears of what the year 2000 might bring, techno-thriller fiction, and what has been dubbed "the paranoid style" in U.S. politics.  Conservative Catholics proved no less prone than fundamentalist Protestants to being swept up in the surrounding culture's manias and follies.  It would be nice to think that the apocalyptic fever has disappeared now that the turn of the millennium is several years behind us having ushered in nothing more remarkable than the failure of widespread predictions that the world's computers would all crash on cue at midnight.  Unfortunately, the continuing incredible success of the (at last count) 12-book "Left Behind" series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins militates against such comforting thoughts.  It was probably inevitable that a Catholic writer would try their hand at this sort of thing, and so we have Michael D. O'Brien's "Father Elijah:  An Apocalypse" along with the rest of the novels in his "Children of the Last Days" series.  Needless to say, as a Roman Catholic, Mr. O'Brien writes with considerably more polish than his benighted Protestant brethren; he also seems able to create characters that have somewhat more depth to them than paper dolls.  Since the author is not shackled by the constraints of biblical literalism, he can also dispense with bizarre and off-putting fixtures from the Book of Revelations, such as giant six-winged brazen locusts whose stings kill, and other equally gory visions.  Despite granting the above points in their favor, his books still hew with amazing precision to the hackneyed formula laid down previously by such Protestant fundamentalist authors as Frank Peretti and Tim LaHaye. In this book, Father Elijah, a Jewish Holocaust survivor turned Catholic priest is dispatched to North America on a perilous secret mission by the Vatican. This is nothing less than to make contact with the Anti-Christ to dissuade him from his evil plan. At the risk of spoiling things, it will be noted here that this infernal personage turns out not to be Nicolae Carpathia, Secretary-General of the U.N., but the President. President of what is made none too clear; Father Elijah's mission takes him to Canada. Considering that this book was published the same year as the Clinton impeachment extravaganza, faithful Christian readers should have no need of having the answer spelled out for them. (All good Christians know that Bill Clinton is the beast with seven heads and ten horns described in Revelations 13.) As with similar-themed books, there has to be at least one token Jewish good guy, presumably to ward off accusations of anti-Semitism.  While Mr. O'Brien has the good taste not to mention what lies in store for those Jews obstinate enough not to convert to Catholicism, other sowers of apocalyptic panic more than make up for this deficiency. (Hint: Jews should pack enough asbestos underwear to last for a long trip.)   Other books in this series take the form of `prequels' and sequels, with settings extending from, roughly, the Paleolithic age (Note to reader: pace, this is meant ironically) to the near future. In the novels set in contemporaneous times such as "Father Elijah", "Eclipse of the Sun" and "Plague Journal", the by-now tiresome tropes of contemporary religious fiction are all wheeled out.   Among these are:  the "soft" totalitarian state that persecutes Christians. (Holy Herbert Marcuse, Batman! Self-pitying Christians in North America who whine about "persecution" should be shipped--perhaps one way--to the Sudan to see what genuine religious persecution is really about.  They might also take in the killing fields of the former Yugoslavia lest they think that religious massacres and expulsions by Christians are something from the remote past.) Noble, upstanding Christian parents, who live in fear of having their children torn from them because they are insufficiently `politically correct'. (Will that hoary cliché never die?  In case anyone has been living under a rock--or perhaps a remote cabin in Ontario; it is now conservatism that has degenerated into a hare-brained hash of contradictory `correct' opinions, all bound together as tightly as the rods of a Roman fasces.) "Feminists", an epithet usually used by conservatives to mean any woman not a doormat, are portrayed in the usual lurid fashion practically as evil succubae; the fons et origo of the Universe's every ill. (Quick!  Can anyone name a single leading present-day feminist now that Betty Friedan is dead and Gloria Steinem long since retired?)  Evil sodomites are presented in time-honored fashion as dissolute and sad--that is, when not fiendishly conspiring with the other standard conservative bugbears to destroy civilization in a fashion similar to "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion".  Top all this off with some Tom Clancy-style high adventure, and voila! There you have it.  Where are Graham Greene, Flannery O'Connor, and Georges Bernanos when you really need them?   It may seem like breaking a butterfly on the wheel to hold up grotesque twaddle like these books for pitiless inspection in the light of common day.  It is not.  During the mid-1980's the publishers of this series of books produced and distributed a truly tenebrous and evil tome, "The AIDS Cover-Up?".  This vile book deliberately aimed to terrorize with spurious projections that AIDS would kill tens of millions of Americans within a decade. To forestall such a cataclysm, it advised that all gays--much less anyone found to be HIV-positive through mandatory testing--be rounded-up and forcibly interned in concentration camps.  According to conservative science writer Michael Fumento (who by his own account lost his job with the Reagan administration for criticizing the book--and the morals of the people touting it), copies of it could be seen on desks all over official Washington in those days.  There are probably still some conservatives who treasure this theo-porn, if only behind the door.  None of the horrors either predicted or recommended by the book ever came to pass, but it was a near thing.  The moral of this story?  Ideas, even the most vicious or worthless, have consequences.  At a time when fantasy and reality are becoming blurred in many minds, books such as Mr. O'Brien's cannot be excused merely because they are classed under "Fiction". People who gabble about the `End Times' in this fashion are (to use a formulation of Orwell's) like those who play with fire who seemingly don't realize that fire is hot and can burn.  If your opponents are not merely mistaken or even just wrong, but are conscious servants of the devil.... Well, there are plenty of deluded souls out there who may decide to suit actions to words.   This series of books (and similar ones by other authors) share a rare distinction: they get it completely upside down. Instead of being threatened by "the dictatorship of relativism", it turns out that what really threatens peace, human rights, and democracy in the world today is what might be called `the dictatorship of certainty'.  In the United States under the presidency of a man gripped by the unshakable delusion that God's will is his will and vice-versa , we now see rank obscenities such as routine and officially-sanctioned torture, cover-ups of massacres, indefinite detention without trial of American citizens and others neither charged nor convicted of any crime, and declarations by the U.S. Attorney General--the nation's highest law-enforcement official--that our "first Catholic President" (as some theoconservative pundits dub him) will only obey such laws as he wishes to.  Not even Presidents Lincoln during the Civil War, Wilson during World War I, or Franklin Roosevelt during World War II did anything like this.  Meanwhile, in Iraq, the Balkans, sub-Saharan Africa and sundry other places; nauseating slaughters go on almost daily, inspired by... feminism?  No; religion, Christianity very definitely included.    Catholicism, more than any other Christian denomination in the U.S. has the poor as its special concern, at least if you believe the hype. In reality it has joined Protestant fundamentalism in collapsing morality down to the private, principally sexual realm.  In this scheme of things, robbing the widow's pension funds for executive perks, and the orphan's Social Security to fund kick-backs to wealthy political donors is, of course, small fault or none.  Instead of showing how they are "not like the rest of men", the popularity of books such as the "Children of the Last Days" series show that some Catholics who preen themselves on bearing witness to a corrupt culture only reflect it as faithfully as a polished mirror--the image is reversed, but every detail is precisely the same. 
 One of my high school students absolutely insisted that I read this book, so after some feeble attempts at making excuses, I agreed to do it.  Because I didn't want to disappoint the boy, I finished the whole book, but if I hadn't promised to read it, I would have put it down about halfway through.  The plot is trite and predictable, but it takes the author forever to get to the predicted point.  (If you're going to write a trilogy, I guess you need a lot of filler.)  The pacing was horribly uneven, the characters are annoying, and the "Kyralian" and "Elyne" words for things we don't have in our world are just plain silly.  There is a glossary in the back of the book if you can't figure out from context what "bol" and "sumi" are.   The magicians don't seem able to DO anything with their magic except create force-fields and communicate telepathically with each other.  Perhaps this book is really an allegory about classism and talent in a stratified society, or maybe it's just another sophomoric, second-rate fantasy novel.  Don't waste your time with it.  Reread Tolkien.    
 This game stinks! The disc its on isnt worth using as a frisbee 
 I'm a big Dean Koontz, fan and it's painful for me to say this but this book sucks. It's about 221 pages long, probably the shortest novel Koontz has ever written (especially if you compare it too novels such as "One Door Away from Heaven" and "From the Corner of His Eye"). The novel is too short, to (A) present any mystery whatsoever and make us care about the characters. The novel is about a woman named Mary, a clairvoyant, who has a gift for tracking down murderers. Both her brother Alan and her husband Max both live with her but can't manage to get along. Alan doesn't trust Max, Max doesn't like Alan. But then Mary begins having visions of murders of young women. The women seem familar to her, but she doesn't know why. It's obvious in the first hundred pages who the killer is, the story is the most mystery-free novel I've read by Koontz. D 
 This is a compelling story, but it's full of inference and excessively fluffy.  From a historian's perspective Huffman does not have enough evidence to be legitimate.  If you're looking for a real history of either Mississippi or West Africa (my two areas of expertise) look elsewhere 
 The authors of this book have not reviewed the latest research on nutrition.  Consequently, their book will not tell you more than you already know.  If you know that vegetables are good for you, you don't need  this book.  That is all you will learn 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 Eden Gray was great as spending a lot of time saying nothing.  This book is a testament to that legacy.  Her insight to the tarot is nothing more than warmer over Pictorial Key by Waite only "vaguer" and her ability to write is questionable; no wonder she spent countless hours in her Mt Kisco home answer angry letters and since she died at 98 in 1999, so you can't be one of them.  
 This is a nice DVD, if you don't mind that 27.9 percent of the original theatrical image has been removed for the DVD exhibition, so that the DVD image fills your entire 4:3 television screen (theatrical aspect ratio - 1.85:1; DVD aspect ratio - 4:3).  If you're okay with that, enjoy! 
 I listened first to the Power of Intention, which was the reason I purchased the Secrets of the Power of Intention.  I found the Secrets of the Power of Intention to be a long version of the Power of Intention, by far the Power of Intention is a disc that will fire up ones sense and the drive to learn more and more.  The Secrets of the Power of Intention is BORING and makes you upset that you even purchased the set, it bring little to lite over the first disc.  I would love to return the disc's, not worth the money 
 Not a bad overview of educational psychology, with plenty of resources for existing teachers to use in their instruction.  As such, the title of this book would more properly be "Educational Psychology for Teachers".  For psychologists and educational psychologists, it is rather inadequate, missing many of the new ideas in educational psychology that have not yet reached the "mainstream" of teaching, where Woolfolk resides.  Most distressingly, her adherence to traditional ideas in education is annoyingly pervasive and interferes with the reader's process of inquiry and the formation of their own conclusions.  As an educator herself, Woolfolk should know better that this 
 I was really displeased with this product. It's horribly dim lighting and distorted lines across the page. The batteries are difficult to jam in also. I'm sending this back. 
 The first thing that you'll notice is that this is a skimpy, short book at 134 pages (160 if you include the appendices).  This would be ok if the content was substantial and useful.  Unfortunately, it provides a very introductory, shallow overview of the covered call writing strategy.  This too would be ok if this was a $15 quick read paperback, but it's an expensive hardcover (which is not worth the price).  I'd suggest the interested reader should check other books on the subject instead 
 This is an incredibly structured book about creativity.  Although I agree with most of what he says, I find little value in this book.  The thing that I disagree with most is the need for tension between bizz and buzz.  I know that harmony between the two is not only acheivable but more productive.  The short stories about real companies earned this book its second star.  They had real value.  To the writers of the 5 star reviews that convinced me to buy this book, I would ask "How in the world did you manage to walk away with anything of practical value?"  It reads like an outline  -- five steps to this, four tools for that, two types of that, three stages of the other thing.  How boring!!  And what a cluttered mind!!  In a sense, it is a great road map but tells you nothing about road conditions or the best route to take.  To me, the creative stories just took up space and slowed me down.  There is more information in a three frame Dilbert cartoon than in one of these stories.   I managed an innovation group for a fortune 100 company for 23 years and my experience taught me that people who try to create a "Cookbook" for creativity are usually devoid of it.  This would be a great $6.00 book 
 TYR vol. 1 consists largely out of modern quasi-philosophical ramblings about the evils of monotheistic religion, science, modernism, humanism, communism and nearly every other form of -ism you can think of. The writers of TYR degrade our historic pagan faith to an antidote or anti-religion to these evils instead of a full-fledged pagan religion, fit for modern age people of Germanic descent. And with a subtitle like: Myth - Culture - Tradition I really not expected this.   Academic value of this journal is not noteworthy, because it mostly contains modern philosophical statements and anti-modern propaganda (!) and not anything noteworthy historically.   Also the writers of TYR call themselves anti-mass culture, a statement not even close to the truth about our ancestral faith and society. People back than lived also in a mass-culture. People from all Germanic countries interacted with each other, shared the same overall religion and Indo-European ancestry. And ironically TYR just became a modernist or even postmodernist perversion. The only difference in society today is, that mass-culture backed by materialistic science leaves no place for religion and in at least Northern Europe people are just not interested in religion, and if they are, it's probably a form of agnosticism. Options of returning towards the spiritual `openness' to the gods as suggested by Collin Clearly are just out of this world. Give up society, go live in the woods and kill your own food, I'm really marvelled about this genius, instead of making Asatru an addition to life and subject of technological and ideological progression, as our forefathers experienced it, we should all return to the woods from whence we came.. Or more truthfully as I see it, we should return to a more traditional collectivistic society, where you live for your family and loved-ones, were hospitality is not something to marvel about and worship again the eternal order, the eternal circle of life and live our lives in worship of the Gods, while working to fulfil our individual destinies, go write a book on that.[... 
 I realize that this is supposed to be an introductory book, however it does not provide enough detail to be very useful in my 2nd year inorganic chem class. I am extremely disappointed by this since the book costs so much money. I wonder how much more it would cost if it was hardcover.   It does have a good layout and bright pictures and colors though. I guess this is supposed to stimulate the brain or something 
 This book wil make you snore. unless you need the statistic of free blacks, and black slaves being freed in New Orleans during Spanish rule, this book is little more than a complete waste of you time 
 So many people have written glowing things about this book, but I don't know why.  I think that I am becoming too practical and logical as I mature, so have less ability to appreciate pointlessness.  I think that the writing was well-done, but the novel itself failed to express or achieve anything of value.   Either a lack of literary sophistication or possessing an understanding of life far deeper and more profound than this novel attempts to portray prevents me from appreciating this novel.  I didn't see why I should ever want to read it again, or have read it at all.  It is kind of like someone tried to artfully arrange dead flowers, so they looked all pretty and still alive, but still, the flowers are dead and have nothing to offer.    About the only thing I got out of it was that the author struggles with mental illness and thinks that being a transient is a glorious transcendent existence.  I assume that I am missing the boat on what this novel has to offer, but still thought it was rather a waste of my time.  
 This is a story line attacking the merits of the resurrection of Jesus as is popular in modern culture.  This work of fiction capitalizes on the swell of popular culture to attack the resurrection of Christ.  One of the books tactics regards Bible inerrancy and addresses the supposed contradictions in the resurrection narratives (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in the Bible).  This is a favorite study of mine and I assure you the accusations are false.    Other than that, the book is an okay read, kinda entertaining in places.  Not too convincing 
 Terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top.  The flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and I wondered what I was eating...!  Alone they were nearly tasteless and I'll never purchase again.  Yuck 
 After seeing the travesty that was episode one in the theatre I decided to give this one a try, assuming that it couldn't possibly get any worse. Was I right? Oh man, I was worse than right. I was wrong. The weak character development that took place with Anakin Skywalker in no way led me to believe that this person could eventually become Darth Vader. The character Anakin is such an undisciplined whiney little brat that it becomes utterly unbelievable that this kid could become a dreaded supervillian. On top of that, the chemistry between him and Padame was very weak. The supposed romance between them was devastated by mediocre acting and no real interesting dialogue.  So once again the special effects department has broken their backs carrying this movie. Without a strong plotline or interesting characters, this movie becomes not a story, but just an impressive light show. It seems as if George Lucas figured that if the technology that he has now is light years ahead of what he had twenty five years ago, then the audience won't need anything else. The special effects in the three 'prequel' movies was so inconsistent with the older films that they should have been released as a completely different story alltogether.  And finally we get to Yoda. A puppet that can bounce around and defy gravity with a lightsaber, but still needs a cane to walk. In the older films, Empire Strikes Back for example, Yoda was balancing on Luke's feet during his handstand. When Luke lost his balance and fell over, wouldn't Yoda be able to just use the force and gently float to the ground instead of tumbling to the ground out of control with him? Is that because of lack of special effects technology back then, or just Yoda was getting too old to use the force anymore? Just a little food for thought. I'll let you decide.  So once again the only plus in this film is the impressive visual effects. If your expecting more however then George Lucas will once again let you down 
 I bought this CD for the song "Tender Years", which has been one of those songs I've had a distant admiration for since I saw this movie back in the 80s.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the audio quality of this cd isn't the best.  It sounds like it's been recorded live with some guy with a microphone (without the live crowd noise) 
 This book is terrible! It's horribly written complete with dialogue that is as trite and flat as a bad 80s sitcom. It starts off with a passive unemployed stay-at-home father whose wife appears to be having an affair. It then develops into a highly boring and implausible tale about nanoparticles trying to take over the world, or trying to eat us all, or something. I don't think Crichton ever really got that far in his thinking.  ***possible spoilers below***  This book is very important in pinpointing a few useful life-rules:  1. Anyone who looks like they have lost weight/bulked up is dangerous! (Those nanoarticles are deadly, but boy, do they help ones' body image)  2. There is nothing much out-of-the-ordinary about a mother slapping her baby when she gets home from work. In fact, if anything, you should always be the one to apologise...it doesn't matter for what.  3. If you're trying to get a few crazy nanoparticles to rule the world, make sure the FIRST thing you do is call in the main guy who is able to destroy your whole big plan.  4. Nanoparticles bear a striking resemblance to sandflies. They say they're thousands of times small than a hairs' breadth...but don't worry, when they buzz around you'll see them no problems. They also have the ability to bite.  The whole things is so badly written from start to finish that it wasn't even a  guilty pleasure! The characters are all so one dimensional and the whole thing towards the end (Ricky and Julia being coated in nanoparticles?!?!) is just ridiculous.   Plot holes are abound, for example, why on earth would this thing need to be transferred via saliva/kissing? They're nanoparticles! If they can buzz around and take differennt shapes etc, then surely they can fly into whatever or wherever they wish.  The BIGGEST surprise for me was that in the end, our 'hero' manages to save the world from these critters with explosions, a trusty sidekick, and some kind of virus that the plant has been haroburing all along.  If someone can give me back my 2 days that I spent reading this rubbish I'd be eternally grateful. I'd ask for my money back, but the book was given to me for free by a bookstore. Obviously they knew its true worth 
 "No one buys or sells without the MONEY of the beast on/in mind or hand" -- Apocalypse. The correct, in context translation of the classical Greek word mistranslated as "mark" is karagma, which means MONEY.  You won't discover the truth about this in Strong's concordance because Strong's Greek-English Lexicon is an abridged version of Liddel-Scott's Greek-English Lexicon.  Same with the word Mammon, which also means money in the Aramaic language, which Jesus spoke. They did not even bother to translate the word because the Pharisees love money. See the whole context of: "You can't serve God & MONEY, you'll either love the one and hate the other . . . but the Pharisees, who loved money heard all this and scoffed.  The so-called christians today do not follow the Logos-Logic of God (John 1:1) but the trite, anti-Christ/anti-Logos-Logic of "Saint" Paul, who was BLINDED by the light.  Confessing with your mouth that Jesus rose from the dead will NOT save you. Only logos-logic will.  The Truth will rise again. Nearly every great philosopher, leader, or revolutionary has realized that the mark of the beast is MONEY, i.e., that MONEY is an unnecessary-evil stumblingblock for the blind.

 I purchased this dvd because I own the 2nd one and like it so much.  Boy, was I disappointed!  The abs diet people must have decided to create the second dvd because this one needed a good edit.  The second dvd covers basically the same exercises but with better instruction and form.  Skip this one and buy the Abs Diet Workout 2 
 Jung is loopy. Jungian psychology is loopy. Jungian psychologists are  loopy. It surprises me that people take this stuff as seriously as they do.  Maybe there's a good Jungian explanation for that too. That said, Jung was,  in my opinion, the Wagner of early psychology, and, like Wagnerian opera,  there's a lot to be learned by mulling over some of the ideas presented  therein. But remember, Jung was more of a Romantic philosopher than a  psychologist. Colorful stuff. Just don't take it too seriously 
 I really enjoy the Falco novels, but this one was disappointing.  I purchased it soon after it was published, started it, but left it unfinished until recently.  I finished it and started Time to Depart which returns to Rome.  I feel that Last Act leaves much to be desired, but enjoy the other titles in the series.  Keep up the good work 
 Well I bought this for my mother-in-law who is hooked on Su Doku.  I bought it just as a small token.  The price was cheap and I thought why not?  Well it is hard to see the screen.  It is also a bit impractical in that if you realise that you got a number wrong 20 turns ago, you have to go and delete all the 20 turns you just spent time doing to get to it and amend it.  The price was cheap, so I was not expecting anything fancy but to be honest I was disappointed with it.    When I realise that I have gotten a number wrong I do not bother trying to find it, I just start a new game.  But the fact that is is so hard to see the screen and find the curser is very annoying and in fact no one even bothers using it now.  We just print out the sheets from the web and do it the old fashoned way with pen and paper on a clipboard.  As I said, no harm done, it was a cheap thing anyhow 
 I thought this movie was decent but nothing spectacular.  It kept me awake but just on the verge.  The few comical scenes helped to keep me interested as did the totally unexpected ending which was probably the best part of the entire movie.  I thought the acting in this movie was just mediocre at best. Overall I was not impressed with the movie but the few good scenes earned it two stars over just the lonely one star.  
 Discursive and digressive, David Thomson's `The Whole Equation' is less a history of Hollywood than a meditation on the business of making pictures.  The book's title comes from a line in F. Scott Fitzgerald's `The Last Tycoon' and refers, I believe, to the multi-faceted quality of picture making.  Motion pictures are products, widgets produced by a place called Hollywood; they are also art, as well as a mirror to our culture, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.    I wanted to like this book.  Thomson seems to be a well-respected film critic and I'm not averse to jumping on a passing bandwagon, but I also wanted to learn a little of the history of Hollywood.  You know, facts piled upon facts?  Thomson is more inclined to impression and analyses, some of it a bit off the board.  The chapter "Divorce, America Style" examines the connection between the rise of the divorce rate in America with what was happening in motion pictures.  It isn't the first, or the last, time Thomson strays to pursue such things.     If you have the patience for it there are some amusing moments, but if you're like me, looking for a just-the-facts history of Hollywood `The Whole Equation' isn't it.  
 When I lived in Santa Fe,parts of the movie were being filmed at a ranch outside the city.There was a fire on the set---which sounds prophetic.It foretold a disaster.  I've seen the first 20 minutes&last 20 minutes of this movie,since the rest is unwatchable.In fact,these segments are unwatchable.There's a gross scene involving a head (even Will Smith looks like he's about to vomit).Kenneth Branagh has tons of awful make-up that would put Tammy Faye Bakker to shame&an unconvincing moustache.The dialogue between Smith&Branagh is made up of terrible racist&impotence jokes.Branagh,after all,has a bevy of scantily-clad beauties.  The final scenes are one looooong chase scene.Ohh,the agony!Avoid this movie at all costs 
 "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"   When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live 
 This book is a collection of Q & A's where Donaldson responds to people who ask her advice about their particular dog problems. Although some generalizations can be made from the problems included, it's hard to know how to generalize--i.e. whether and how a suggestion given to one owner makes sense in your own case. This means that this book is at best marginally useful for people who want and need detailed advice on how to reform their dog's behaviour. If you have a serious problem, don't look for reliable solutions in this book of anecdotes 
 I'm a med school student, and I hate to say that this book was not helpfull at all in my anatomy class. It doesn't get into the specifics we were requiered to know. In addition, it is organised by systems, which is too different from most books and atlases, which are organised by areas of the  body (for example Moore's textbook or Netter's atlas).  If you want a faster review book then your textbook, get Moore's essentials of clinical anatomy instead 
 I did not like this book.  It seemed like something a high school student would have written.  Several other reviewers mentioned that they like the characters.  I found them boring.  I much prefer the characters in Elizabeth Peters series of Amelia Peabody mysteries about Egypt, or the Rumpole series by John Mortimer 
 This may have been a good album, but lets be honest she is not a good singer, did you now hear her performance on BET???? Her backup singers she get her record sales...I was loving her w/ "Torn" till I heard her perform it and not only was my heart torn but so were my ears.  Come on now I don't care what kinds of songs she comes out with she'll never be on the same level with "B" I'm sorry: 
 Why? Someone tell me why. Someone e-mail me and explain to me why. There is nothing to gain here. Nothing to be learned, nothing to excite, no story. Why? Seriously, is there any documentation that might explain WHY this thing (not a film) exists. Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre is so unprecedented in it's poorness, that it doesn't even succeed in being a dumb slasher flick. Let me reiterate. The filmmakers actually FAILED at the least complicated genre in the book. If I wanted a series of randomly assembled images leading nowhere I would have rented "Week End".  The only reason to see this is that ever crafty curiosity value. Yes, you will be compelled to watch, if only to observe some clue as to why both Matthew McConaughey (pre-"A Time to Kill") and Renée Zellweger (pre-"Jerry Maguire") accepted the lead roles (the clue never comes). Texas Chain Saw fans will, of course, feel the completist need to see this, the death knell of the series. And finally, I think just the concept of Leatherface as a shrieking cross-dresser will garnish a few bewildered viewers. But believe me folks, this still doesn't answer the ultimate question: Why? Why?! WHY? 
 This book has little in specifics for a photography business. It does have lots of basic common sense advice about home businesses in general. For example, he tells you to check in the yellow pages to see who your competition will be. Also, you can get some of his information for free, such as the tax regulations from the IRS 
 I am a proclaimed lover of musicals and movie musicals and I was incredibly disappointed by Gigi. As if the overdone french accents aren't enough to turn one off altogether the acting is ridiculously overdramatic and forced. The one redeeming thing in most musicals is at least the song and dance aspect, however for me that might have been the worst part. The songs were repetitive and catchy in a way that makes you want a lombotomy or temporary memory loss to get those stupid tunes and words out of your head. The moral of this story is, spend your time and money on the plethora of wonderful movie musicals and stay far away from this on 
 Short version: A half dozen scientists and engineers are working in the arctic, attempting to use explosives to create a huge iceberg that can floated to someplace in dire need of fresh water. They become marooned and only have a few hours before the explosives they've planted go off and kill them. However, a Russian sub may be able to save them.  Koontz had the right idea when he originally released this book under a pseudonym, because it's a stinker.  The set-up building to the scientists being stranded and the deadline imposed by the explosives is unbelievable. Suffice it to say that a natural disaster hundreds of miles away just happens to target the exact location of where the scientists are working. Additionally, they've planted explosives in the ice that are on timers and can't be switched off.  Besides suffering from incompetence, the characters have unbelievably bad luck (beyond being targeted for destruction by Mother Nature, that is):   -One is highly phobic, terrified of (you guessed it): ice & snow (because of an accident that killed her parents)! -Another's family was murdered in China -Another's had close relatives assasinated while in office and is disillusioned by politics (a thinly disguised JFK jr?) -Another lost his son to cancer -Another's psychotic  If that's not bad enough, the main characters are a husband and wife team who run the project. She had a relationship with another scientist that ended badly before getting married to the current guy. So who does her husband pick to spend months on ice with? Why the ex-boyfriend of course! Because he was the best at what he did (excuse me, wouldn't second best have made more sense?)  If you don't mind really bad dialog and trite situations, give this book a try. If you want a really intense adventure/thriller try Wilbur Smith's "Hungry as the Sea" or anything by Nelson DeMille 
 I love the idea behind this game and it's pretty impressively exectuted. I had three gripes though: 1) It's so fast paced that I found it really difficult to progress past the third procedure. 2)I couldn't get the magnify and reduce (with quick little circles) to work.  This caused me great frustration. 3)There's no way to skip through the seemingly endless pages of character dialogue if you have to repeat a procedure a couple of times. I quit playing it pretty quickly 
 This is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected. Lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself. Then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie, the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper. Queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music. This is ridiculous! Kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game. Please please please spare us and stop rapping 
 Mr Yoo moves on from his earlier arguments that torture falls at a point slightly short of physical death, organ failure or loss of limb. Mr Yoo makes some interesting if devastating points with his new theories. The President's war powers, he argues, allow him to do, basically, whatever he wants. The President may, if he chooses, crush the genitals of children, maim, torture or kill civilians. In this respect one might remember that Bush ordered an air strike on the house occupied by the infant grandchildren of Saddam Hussein AFTER the end of the Iraq war and even though the house was surrounded by US troops. The President is limited, according to Mr Yoo, only by how he CHOOSES to interpret International Treaties and as he has the power to repudiate such treaties or ignore them entirely (as in the International Human Rights for the Child Treaty, the Geneva Convention or the Treaty of Vienna,) then, this means that presidential power is absolute EVEN if despotic criminal or tyrannical. Mr Yoo appears now to say that the President and his henchmen, cronies and agencies MAY indeed use indiscriminant torture. Mr Yoo however does not adequately explain how the President can thus overturn congressional treaty ratification. As what constitutes a 'time of war' is also up to the President and does not rely on any 'legal' declaration of war (which is a matter of international law to which the US is thus not subject,) then the US may have, effectively, a Despot Emperor for President. Does the 'War on Drugs' thus give the President the same wartime powers as he asserts for his 'War on Terror' - an undeclared war on no particular nation state? Is the US thus always in a state of war? This is interesting, not just semantically, as the District and Supreme Courts appear to agree with Mr Yoo's interpretation, blocking cases connected with this on grounds of national security whilst Congress does not appear to care. Perhaps Clinton should have used Mr Yoo's arguments in the Monical Lewinsky scandal and impeachment hearings. War powers might have thus allowed him to do whatever he wanted with his cigar and to lie about it in the national interest. The problem with Mr Yoo's argument is that Checks and Balances thus no longer appear to exist. Interestingly if one applies Mr Yoo's arguments to their logical end he becomes an eloquent advocate for terrorism or for the Holocaust where the ends justify the use of any means, however horrible. Of course, either this is pretty much nonsense and makes toilet paper of the Declaration of Independence, Magna Carta, democracy and human rights OR the truth is more terrifying and the US is now a Stalinist or Nazi state. I suspect Mr Yoo could be subject to arrest as a war criminal should he ever leave the United States and visit a civilised country?? 
 Communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history, responsible for the extermination of 100+ million people. This book (which started it all) holds at least much of the blame. Communists were and still are a threat to the free world, and communism is a slave system. Some "intellectuals" actually support the tired mantras of Marx's philosophy, whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven't seen enough sunlight, I don't know. In any case, if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property, and is totalitarian and slave-driving (the government owns everything, including you). And the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up. Pol Pot, Mao, Stalin (of course), etc etc...who are these people kidding 
 You loved Ender's Game, right?  And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean.  Terrific.  Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.  It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books.  The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).  This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.  It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.  It hardly makes any sense at all.  Beware 
 This book is very thin.  Basically, have good ethics and good customer service skills.  It could have been written as a brochure.  Some of the tips are good, but overall very weak 
 This ebook version is totally unusable.  The interface is fine for a document that will be read page by page.  It is impossible for this 1,00+ page reference book.  When you download it and find it is completely unsable, you will then find that Amazon is not making refunds on ebooks.  THAT FACT IS NOT SHOWN ON THIS PAGE.  Save your [$$$].  If you want Bartlett's - as many of us do - buy the printed version.  This virtual version [stinks].  [Of course that is a technical term. 
 My son who's 6 just received this Playhut for his birthday and it looked like a really neat idea before I set it up. It's extremely flimsy, does not want to stay up, the tent space is TINY and the sleeping bag is extremely thin. All in all, it's a total waste of money, unfortunately I can't take it back because it's a gift 
 I just finished this book a few days ago and was left feeling largely nothing.  The plot was more interesting than Jack Maggs, but not by much.  The story of a desperado in the Australian frontier who becomes somewhat of a Robin Hood figure fighting agaisnt the corruption of the government, is something that should be right up my alley.  But for some reason this missed the mark, almost entirely.  I didn't care that much for the main character.  He was noble in intent, and and interesting guy, but I never really felt like I was "rooting" for him wholeheartedly the way one should in a "hero" tale like this.  The dynamics within his family and his gang were very hard to relate to as well.  People seemed to change their feelings towards each other at the drop of a hat.  The lack of punctuation was somewhat annoying, but I can't blame that entirely either, since Jose Saramago's "Blindness" used the same device and is a book that I really loved.  The plot jumped around a decent amount and could get a bit hard to follow at times.  I've read an awful lot of multi-layered and intricate books and usually have no problems, so I don't think it was just me.  I agree with some of the other reviewers at being surprised at all the fuss that was made about this book (and Carey's writing in general.)  It certainly is not awful, but I wouldn't rank him up there with Ian McEwan, Donna Tartt or John Banville (whose "Book of Evidence" I just recently discovered and am thoroughly enjoying presently).  Anyways, Ned Kelly was not a terrible read, but I do feel there's alot of stuff that is more "lush", and flowing and moving in a literary sense, that is out there currently 
 I bought the book,but am sorry I bought it.Maybe I'm overeducated for this book,having taken courses in Geography,Geology and History.I read little that was new to me.For someone less knowledgeable,it could be interesting.The format is easy to use and the descriptions are easy to follow.But I was not inspired and as I indicated  am sorry 
 This book contains more useless history and religious education than viable techniques. Even most of the usable information themselves are dumbed down with ancient, irrelevent mystic ambiguoussness.   Perhaps this book would be more useful to a person with a keen interest in eastern religious values. To its benefit, it also contains some relevent basic psychiatry, predominantly when it describes how the human mind saves information, as well as the use of symbols.  Get [i]The 48 Laws of Power[/i] by Greene, [i]Influence, the pshychology of persuasion[/i] by Robert B. Cialdini and [i]Four Arguments For the Elimination of Television[/i] by Jerry Mander. The information provided in those three tomes are more precise, more in-depth, and more worth your time and money. Don't buy this travesty 
 The protagonist in this novel is so unreal and unrelatable that it's difficult to read.  Besides the fact that this book is extremely slow moving, it's almost as if the author made a caricature of a character and we're supposed to buy it.  She's completely unsympathetic and it's almost embarrassing reading about her naivete.  It's just too difficult for me to buy that she could be as dumb as she is sometimes and then so insightful at others.  She's not likeable and it's not any surprise that she has no friends (because, basically, she has no personality) and it's totally confusing when she catches the eye of the most popular boy (even just for sex) because it doesn't ring true at all.  There are just so many things about being young that it seems the author has gotten wrong.  To me, Fiora is the opposite of preppy, it's something she doesn't even know how to be.  There were a lot of times when I almost gave up finishing this book, out of boredom and annoyance and I don't think that, by completing it, I have gained anything.  Which proves, yet again that, just because a book is a "bestseller" and loved by the masses, does not mean it's quality 
 The best part about this book was the intro.  In fact all you need to understand what the late Mr. Bloom was trying to put forth is in the introduction.  The rest of the book is  a chore to read.  The confusing and tedious writing  style leads to a lot of re-reading of sentences to figure out the point the author is trying to make.  Someone should have counseled Mr. Bloom that "Brevity is the soul of wit."  
 I am an adult who enjoys YA literature, but this book was absolute nonsensical fluff.  I became aware of this book when Amazon recommended it to me because I liked The Boyfriend List.  I read the book in an hour or so last night, and I got nothing worthwhile from the experience.  What stood out to me the most is the fact that the main character's motivation never really made sense.  The plot construction hinges on Claudia concluding that her sex appeal must be waning and deciding to practice her flirting skills by striking up a conversation with one new guy every day.  So far, so good.  The problem is that she comes to this conclusion after only one week of being single, and immediately after some random guy at a party tries to kiss her.  Claudia successfully extricates herself from the guy trying to make out with her, is complimented on the way she handled the guy by her Crush, and what she takes from those back-to-back experiences is that she must not be very attractive to guys.  That makes no sense whatsoever.  Seriously, that's precisely the lack of internal logic and appropriate plot development you can look forward to in this book. Claudia is swarmed with male attention to an unrealistic degree (her ex-boyfriend is trying to get back together with her, band members that she interviews proposition her, the most socially important guy at her first Greek party hits on her, guys at the gym ogle her, a really great guy sees her at a coffee shop once and is so taken with her that he arranges a way to meet cute with her later) and yet she keeps telling us in her narrative that she lacks confidence in her ability to attract men.  I was never able to really connect with Claudia and I did not think that her experiences had any ring of truth to them.  It's a fast read, but completely forgettable and only slightly enjoyable 
 I feel I must protect other unwitting prospective readers from this directionless, suspenseless, bore.  Being a fan of all things Egypt and an Agatha Christie fan as well I thought this book would be sure to please---not so!  Short of Grisham I've never read about heroic characters so impossibly beautiful, charming, intelligent, desirable, and perfect in any way and SO boring.  Was this a mystery?  I don't remember much of a plot at all.  Just characters going from one place to another and getting engaged in conflictless conflicts.  Finally, why set it in Egypt if you intend to use next to nothing of the country, its people (other than a few trite stereotypes), and its antiquities?  Reading it on a long plane flight, I actually pondered whether finishing the book or crashing would be preferable.  For my guilty pleasure I'll go back to Stephen King---Tolstoy by comparison 
 This essay may be worthwhile reading for someone getting started in the sport but it useless for the experienced sportsman. Little more than a superficial retred of what so many others have written. Save your money and buy something from the classic outdoor writers like Ruark, O'Conner, or Gene Hill. You could also try the nature writers like Teale, Carrighar, Thompson-Seton, Paul Brandreth, John Taintor Foote or many others 
 One question for people who think this neo-Confederate is a legitimate historian: If the  cause of the Civil War was not slavery, what was it? If you can name something, and show that it has NO connection to slavery, then you win. But of course, you can't do this, because slavery was at the heart of everything during the sectional crisis. Westward expansion was about slavery. Bleeding Kansas was about slavery. So called "States' Rights" is really just another way of saying "The Right to Own Slaves," because what other "rights" did the South have to maintain that were so different than the North? None.  Think about this: What about Lincoln's election so terrified the South? Did Lincoln threaten to take away southern land? No. Did Lincoln threaten to shut down southern manufacturing? No. Did Lincoln threaten to take away southern lifestock? Did he threaten to dismatle the southern court system? No. No. what was the one thing, the one single cornerstone of southern society (and the one thing that seperated the South from the North) that seemed to be at stake with the election of Abraham Lincoln? Yep, slavery.   If you still don't think slavery was the single root cause of the Civil War, answer this: could there have been a Civil War without slavery? No. Because if you take slavery out of the equasion, than you take away the root that connects every other minor branch of supposed reasons for the outbreak of war, from "States Rights" to the "Southern Way of Life," ie: the slaveholding way of life. If you are still ignorant to the basic truth, consider this famous quote from Alexander Stephens, Vice President of the Confederacy, from a speech he delivered in Savannah, Georgia, on March 21, 1861. Quote: "The new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists among us-the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. Jefferson, in his forecast, had anticipated this, as the 'rock upon which the old Union would split.' He was right."  I, of course, did not make this quote up. Look up Stephens' speech in any history book or archive, and you can read it for yourself. Slavery was the cause of the Civil War. When you say your Southern ancestors fought to maintain "Their way of Life," what you are really saying is that they fought to maintain the most defining aspect of Antebellum southern society: slavery. Go ahead, say that the majority of Southerners did not own slaves. True. But, the majority of people today do not own BMW's, or summer houses in the Bahamas. That doesn't mean they do not ASPIRE to own those things. The average southern yeoman may not have owned slaves, but because slave-owning was the highest mark of status in southern society, he certainly hoped to SOMEDAY own a slave, or two, or three...Many southerners fought for the right to maintain slavery, in the hope that someday they might own them. Read REAL history. It is not "Northern Biased," it is simply conclusive fact based on imperical evidence.    
 I zipped through the first 100 pages of this book unable to put it down.  Unfortuneately the author seems to run out of gas after that.  The main character just goes on a big, boring sight seeing tour.  It reminded me of that show on the Travel Channel where that girl visits hotel after hotel fawning over the interior design. There is not a hint of conflict until the final pages and then it's very short-lived and quickly followed by one of the worst non endings I've ever read.  The book just stops.  Not a hint of resolution or even a cliff hanger pointing to a sequel.  It's a shame because Grimsley had some great concepts to work with.  In my experience novels that mix technology with magic usually fail at both, but Grimsley had a workable foundation he could have developed into something unique if he had focused on the SF concepts instead of minutiae.    Once in a while the characters stop admiring the drapes long enough to notice the GIANT FREAKIN' PORTAL BETWEEN TWO WORLDS--but enough about that.   Gee, what a lovely sofa.. 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical 
 This book is horribly outdated!  If you have Acrobat 5, - fine. Or maybe not so fine... use the money you would have spent on this book and upgrade to the current Adobe version: Acrobat 7 as of Sept 2006. ..and beware of Wiley Books that don't specifiy the application version - -  Wiley is notorious for this -- remember, when purchasing a Wiley book -- think twice if the version of the application is not specified. 
 It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book. This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.  The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.  People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.  I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad 
 I tried not to put this book down and just give it up-it was a true test of wills!  Cheryl Ladd may have accomplished her goals as a golfer but the book is nothing but fluff as big as Farrah Fawcetts' hair in the '70's.  A real disappointment in a book that I thought would be more provacative, at least have a few good golf tips 
 Bought this book used and it was still overpriced. The time I spent reading it was priceless compared to the completely inane "blathering". As others have said, the sex isn't even sexy. At least the wife-swapping showed some unusual relationship-type intereaction. What a boring, bizarre story. Somebody spank Piers and put him back in the land of Xanth 
 I'm a psychiatric nurse. Peter Breggin is well known in the field of psychiatric medicine as being anti-all drugs.  Has prozac been overprescribed or mis-prescribed? sure. but this drug and the class it belongs to have helped WAY more people than they hurt. penicillin and other antibiotics can kill you too if you're allergic and don't know it. and antibiotics are WAY over prescribed if you ask me and other professionals. i've worked in state psychiatric hospitals and i've seen a LOT of people who only got out and back to the world because of medication.  i would hate to think that a book like this would turn back the clock to the old days when there was no medication and people wasted their whole lives in the hospital. GET A GRIP: ANYthing you put in your body has side effects and you can die from taking too much Tylenol, too. picking on this drug is a cheap tric 
 A formulaic thriller that includes everything but the kitchen sink - unrepentant Nazis, Basque separatists, an outcast murderous tribe of Eskimos, Canadian natives in northern Quebec, environmental activists and the usual female sex interest. This one goes beyond the pale and actually seems comedic at best. The heroes can thank their lucky stars that the dastardly villains resort to that time-worn cliche of gloating instead of getting on with killing them when they've got the chance!  This one's definitely a laffer! Give it a pass and save your pennies for the next one.  
 Having used Sybex Study Guides in the past, I thought this book would be all I needed to pass the 70-271 exam.  Boy, was I wrong.  The material presented in this book was not nearly in depth enough to properly prepare for the test.  After reading this book and using all the resources available on the CD, there were questions on the exam that I was simply not prepared for.  If you must buy this book, get other materials to supplement it.  Sybex makes some really good study guides.  Unfortunately, this isn't one of them 
 I am reading & reading to get over what seemed to be endless story telling without excitement.  King should rewrite the part what Straub had written and relaunch a revision.  Even die-hard fans of King will loose patience 
 Here is another example of where 90's-era digital animation ends up being mundane.  Even with the decade or so that has passed since the brief explosion of digital animation releases, I still enjoy watching the good ones (Gate to the Mind's Eye, Televoid).  This one doesn't count.  The effort that went into this work was obviously tremendous, so you can't fault the quality.  It's also fairly unique in mixing animation with real imagery shot on location.  But it's just so dull.  I suppose if you've had a really bad day and wanted to watch (and hear) something soothing, this would be a good choice.  I, although I certainly have my share of hectic days, want my animation to be gripping, weird, and fun.  Illuminated Manuscripts is just high-tech yoga. 
 My husband and I LOVED the original Amityville and were SO disappointed by this remake. With the special effects we have nowadays I thought this movie would have been great, I was wrong. It was pure Hollywood garbage. 
 I felt cheated after I read this book.  It wasn't fair to draw Scotty so precisely, yet leave the other characters (his family) so undeveloped.  Did anyone ever explain to Scotty that it wasn't his fault that his mother left?  Did anyone ever consider getting Scotty some therapy with a trained counselor?  Did anyone attempt to help Joan before she left?  Too many unanswered questions and poorly drawn characters left me thinking: "This book could have been so much better." What's the point of breaking our hearts if there was never any real substance to begin with?  
 I downloaded this sonng called FRONT A BUSTA right? this dude on here said it was beatin, it aint beatin worth sh&t u know? plus his rhymes are weak, theres pauses in the middle of the songs too. if i were u just stick to project pat, 36 mafia, devin, twista, brotha lynch, c-bo, z-ro, 2pac, lil flip, and ugk.thank yall 4 listenin SHOUT OUT TO MPMS IN DA FORT AKA 4TWAYNE! this ur boy heath aka tyrome? arright then go get those albums aight? peac 
 I bought three of these for my two 6 year olds and my 7 year old.  Every one of them arrived in abysmal condition.  Strings everywhere... loose tuning screws that could not be tightened... and scratches.  I could not believe that anyone would sell something this inferior.  Shocking is an understatement describing this purchase 
 I really wish I had read the book flap before buying this book.  Had I read that it had anything to do with NASCAR, I would have put it down and spent my $25+ on another book....my mistake.  The ONLY reason I actually read the whole book is because I did pay $25+ for it and just felt like I should.  It was not entertaining and just dragged on and on.  So, not only was it dull and slow, it was about NASCAR...a sport and subject that is just not my cup of tea.  I love the Stephanie Plum series and will continue to purchase Evanovich books in that series, but will not buy anything else 
 It's hard to figure out which review point to what...  Why doesn't Amazon.com simply leave reviews for this volume instead of linking to other books in the series.  It makes it confusing to figure out if this hardcover edition is worth buying over the paperbacks... 
 I ordered several items from the collection "Texture Leaves" by Corelle Corrdinates and twice the 4-piece casserole bake & serve set was broken in shipment. The other items were replaced and made the second shipment.  I recommend ordering the 4 piece casserole somewhere else or buying in a store. 
 If you want a historical perspective on the H2O2 studies conducted during the past century, this is the book.  I should have saved my money.  I recommend "Flood Your Body With Oxygen: Therapy For Our Poluted World" by Ed McCabe.  McCabe explains it so that the information is understandable and usefull.    
 I purchased this after reading rave reviews as well as the recommendation by my company and was very disappointed. Even though I have a BA in Business, I'm always looking for new ideas and ways to learn.  However, I was disappointed at how much Charan oversimplified some basic terms and didn't even give a thorough defintion of "velocity" -- one of his key points.  I read in just a few hours and am giving to goodwill -- one of the few books I won't put in my home library 
 steer clear.  This movie suffers from terminal SCS... Shaky Camera Syndrome, the latest thing nowadays to make a movie look cool.  Not only does that leave you disturbed physically, but it distracts you from what could be crucial elements of the story, such as Giovanni Ribisi's family history, which they also manage to screw up, leaving you really not caring if he wins or loses in the end.  Pile on top of that the awful acting and the extremely poor casting choices of Ben Affleck and Vin Diesel, and you have a waste of time.  As for Giovanni Ribisi, he's ok in this movie, but go buy/rent Heaven with him and Cate Blanchett 
 I love Radiohead.  Repeat, I love Radiohead.  They put out the best 4 albums in a row since the beatles in the 60's.  That being said...  This is the worst produced DVD I have ever seen.(!)  It features perhaps 8 cameras with random selection of camera choice at almost exactly 4 second intervals.  It is almost impossible to become interested in any part of the proceedings because you don't have the opportunity to watch any one of the fellas do ANYTHING for more than 4 seconds at a time.  I can't believe anyone allowed this to happen.  Who thought this was a good idea?  He (or she) should be forced to watch this abomination.  It's like staring into a strobe lite for an hour.  The only saving grace is that it is "filmed" at a time when the Band was beginning to ferment. Play it, but don't you dare watch or your likely to wind up in convulsions on the floor.     Come on boys, enough is enough.  Give us a good, modern DVD, in at least dolby 5.1.  I wouldn't care if you just used one camera.  Please.  Pretty please.    By the way.  Would everyone please drop any references to the band called Coldpl_y (sorry, my fingers won't allow me to type the complete name)?  How did Radiohead ever get linked with this completely unoriginal and mediocre band 
 I should have known that decorating "Martha-style" would not be my style.  Her passion in finding the "old" at bargain prices and making it "work" for her is not what I call decorating.  She loves to re-furbish, re-store and re-model ... I don't.  However, my expectations were really dashed after completion of the book and realized there was no valid reason for her publisher to classify it as a decorating book.  If you like to read about Martha's homes, her anecdotes and her convoluted names of Martha-labled paint colors, you will enjoy it ... maybe.  I've seen and heard it all before.  
 Most of the allegations made in this book, usually by rightwing mudslingers rather than leftwing ones, are old smears and distortions which have been disproven by responsible journalists (sadly, a disappearing breed.) Consider the source: Alexander Cockburn is an arrogant 'cocktail party vanguard' fake leftist who's best known for wacko conspiracy theories and vicious personal attacks 
 This movie just doesn't do anything for me. I am suspicious the marketing people and staffs working on this movie write most good reviews here.  The movie is just creepy. The uncle totally abuses his nephew. That's so not showing a kid how to play the game. That's child abuse. The main character (the uncle) is obnoxious. He just keeps yapping and yapping nonsense. It gives you a headache.  The dialogues are poorly written. It's not smart or funny. Everything coming from the main character's mouth makes me want to hang myself. He is so annoying and 99% of the movie is him talking 
 I am a Vietnam War history buff, but I just couldn't get into this book at all.  Not because the material isn't good, it is just presented poorly 
 I was truly excited when I heard that Heart had released a brand new studio album, after so many live and compilation releases during the 90's.  Heart's last studio album "Desire walks on", if not a masterpiece, is certainly the best they had done since... let's say "Bebe le strange". The "desire" album certainly rocks and tracks like "Black on black" or "Desire walks on" should be ranked among Heart's best ever.  But... then here comes this "jewel", Jupiter's darling. Dear Ann and Nancy WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING!!!!??? Did you think that coming up with raw, unifinished songs, horrible vocal effects, dully lyrics and AN EXTREMELY LARGE SONG SET was going to put you back in the market??? The answer, and you could have probably noticed in the charts, is clear. IT'S NO. I tried, really tried hard to give this album a chance, but I confess, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LISTEN TO IT COMPLETELY. Just listen to "Fallen ones" for example, what is going on!!! I thought I would never say that about Heart, but Lindsay Lohan is better than this!!!!  The only track that is vaguely rescuable is "The oldest story in the world" and that is because of the amazing opening riff ONLY! The rest of the song is crap, pure crap and boring nothingness.  Ok the first tracks of the album aren't that crappy but it gets worse and worse as it goes on (and I don't really know how it ends, and I don't wanna know!!)  If this is all that Heart was going to come up with for a comeback, they should have remained in our memories instead. Actually I had to relisten to a few seconds of some of the tracks to get again the bad feeling I had when I first listened to this and now I will listen to "Anything is possible" (in my opinion, Heart's sweetest ballad) to get rid of that feeling!  By the way, what happened to "Heaven" and some of the songs that were suppoused to be in their "next studio album"? It would have been much better to have an album based on that material than in this "concept".  Jupiter darlings please retire!!! 
 The author was fairly comprehensive in this book, covering everything that beginning and intermediate-level ice anglers NEED to know for safety, comfort and fishing success.  However, after reading half the book I had to put it down due to the overwhelming support the author gives to his obvious sponsor, HT Enterprises.  HT does make good equipment, but this book is blatently biased toward their products and the reader is literally pummelled with free advertising for their products.  I almost liken this to some TV fishing shows that are obviously paid advertisements cloaked in the veil of good ol' boy entertainment.  Consequently, after forcing myself to read the rest of this book, this angler had a bad taste left in his mouth and is wishing he had purchased a different title 
  People actually gave this movie 5 stars! Are they for real? If you want a good shoot'em up action movie with lots of hip hop and blunt smoking then this movie is for you. It is fun to watch, but to say it is true to life is like saying cabin boy is politicaly thought provoking. It is a fantasy about how rappers wish there life styles really are. Their are so many Scar Face ripoffs it's offencive, and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said "Okay, we don't have much film left, we gotta' rap this up real quick. DMX, find religion...and cut." Rent the movie, try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying, ignore the horrible acting of Naz, then return it. And when you review it please don't give it five stars, those are supposed to be for the cream of the crop, not just some "Phat movie you and some down ass playas' watched while moms was outta' da' house. 
 I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!     
 The problem with the book is not with how much material it covers, but with how well it covers the material. Most good computer books that I have read have covered a topic and then gone to explain something step by step using examples and multiple scenarios, but I feel this book just gives a "it works because it does" attitude 
 Here's what I learned from this movie:  Oscar Wilde was gay.  That's it.  Never mind that he was a brilliant writer, an astute observer of society's foibles, a witty convesationalist, and a darn interesting guy.  Because he was gay, and apparently that's the only thing that anyone should care about.  Sadly, the film doesn't explore any other aspect of Wilde's life.  I wonder if he'd been heterosexual if the filmmakers would have felt the need to subject us to so many graphic and pointless sex scenes.  Doubtful.  These scenes are not distasteful, just unnecessary.  How many times must I watch Oscar fondle a young boy before it just becomes redundant?  Ironically, while making a solid case that Wilde was a victim of a rigid, unforgiving society, the film itself falls victim to its own good intentions.  Where once Wilde was villified for his sexual preferences, here he is nothing but his sexual preferences.  I wanted more.  I wanted to experience Oscar Wilde as a full human being, not just a gay man.  Even this falls flat.  His relationship with his young male lover is surprisingly shallow and uninvolving.  Oh, well, Oscar.  Maybe they'll make another movie in a hundred years, and we'll all be uninterested enough in who Wilde was having sex with to actually learn something about his life. 
 MC Hammer.  Then... "Hammer".  Then the out of control payroll.  The mega dancers... the big show, the baggy pants, the funky hair-cut... the bankruptcy, Vanilla Ice Feud, and then Surreal Life with Webster.  MC HAMMER!  This was the second big album from the late-80's, early 90's dance guru that had a penchant of taking old school baselines and tunes while dancing to them with this enormous entourage of performers.  1990... the year of Wilson Philips, Milli Vanilli, Sinead O'Conner, Bel Biv Devoe and loads of others.  Or was it 1989?  Bah.. does it really matter?  To be fair, this really WAS the bees knees back then.  Who can forget "2 Legit 2 Quit", or how about "U Can't Touch This"?  That song was so wildly overplayed that I actually credit it for teaching me the basics into radio programming and commercialism and the value of my own personal collection.  My word... I'm getting nightmares just thinking about how you could turn from one station to the next, and then to the NEXT with the same bloody song still on the radio.  But it got the dance parties going and you just weren't in the know if you didn't have your copy of MC Hammer's album in your jr. high school.  And gees... this was so un-original.  I mean, they took the line from Prince's cut yet "When Dove's Cry" wasn't ancient when this came out.  Then the "Have You Seen Her" love wrap was sorta funny and cool (back then).  But y'know, now that my memory is jogged, I don't think I was so impressed with the general album in the early 90's either because there were some crummy tracks in it even for that time period.    For the sheer comedy value, I'd recommend this.  For the 'musical value', i'd say your red cent is better spent in the circling coin rolling machine at your local shopping center.  Yes, people are actually selling this for 1 cent (maybe not even American...) - that's perhaps a fraction of the cost of shipping!  I'd actually haggle with them until they agree to pay the shipping for you and throw in the atrocious bomb of a 'step' album that he put out in the mid 90's too.  Looking at all of the behind the scenes things that happened, the rise and fall of such artists that came from his entourage (B Angie B, Vanilla Ice, etc.) you can't help but remember the past and chuckle.  The image of the video to "Can't Touch This" alone puts me in tears ... the bridge where he dances - priceless.  Yet I can't be too hard on him - Hammer was always about the live shows and if you got to go to those, the man could really move!  I mean, didn't it help distract you from the hollow lyrics too?  But I guess in an era with emerging gangsta rap (NWA, etc. were still on the rise), it was a welcome, lighter change.  
 If there was 0 stars, that's what it would get.  My kid INSISTED on buying this crap.  I said it was okay, hoping she wouldn't eat it.  Then she cooked it in her easy bake.. very excited about it.. and I absoloutly refused to let her eat it.  It was GROSS.  the smell was revolting.  She ate it anyway and nearly threw up.  Thanks but.. GROSS.  
 After reading Maureen Dowd's article, "What's a Modern Girl to Do?" in the October 2005 New York Times, I immediately ordered this book. Maureen Dowd's writing is certainly entertaining, and she is obviously a sharp intuitive writer. Are Men Necessary, however, is one of the most jumbled books I have ever read. Throughout the book, she lacks a clear unifying point and she often reuses information. I felt like I jumped into a crazy stream of consciousness and was never oriented.  Maureen Dowd obviously was well researched when she wrote this. Her witty sarcastic writing often masks her lack of a clear path. The book was entertaining, and at times, thought provoking, until the last chapter.  The final chapter was ultimately a tribute to Hilary Clinton. Dowd does not clearly conclude her book; instead, she aimlessly hopes that in a dreadfully long tribute the reader can come to some sense of finality.  Nevertheless, if you are interested in this topic, please check out her article, "What's a Modern Girl to Do." It is wonderful and well worth the 15 minute read. 
 A story that fails to engage the reader and leaves Dan Lenson stranded in the desert, with no water in sight. Not up to the earlier efforts 
 ...I read a chapter of the book at a bookstore and my opinion is it is good if you want more practice questions to add to other resources you are already using. (I know it is kind of funny the way review question and answers are numbered 
 Is this research? Is it a long statistical essay? Or is it an agenda-laden piece of you know what? Has Mr. Greene ever spent a second in front of a real classroom? He criticizes Jonathan Kozol referring to his writing as "anecdotal" and not research-based. OK. But at least Kozol has done some 'real" leg work and visited schools in poverty stricken areas all over the US and speaks with the kids, parents, teachers, and principals.  Plus, Kozol is a talented writer.  Reading this book, however, one gets the feeling that Mr. Greene has been hanging with the high set rather than the homeboys.  The chapter where he contends that there is no evidence demonstrating that smaller class size has educational benefits is pretty laughable. Ask anyone who has ever taught both small versus large classes. There is no comparison.  Come on, Jay, even you can't believe what you've written, deep down 
 I was completely enveloped in the stuff I read about this movie.  The main selling point was somewhere it says "the film Tarantino calls 'the roughest revenge movie ever'."  Now, I love Tarantino, but he must have been completely wasted, and/or thinking of a completely different movie when he said that.  That, or it was 1976.  This movie is absurd.  I'm sure back in 1974, it was cutting edge and over-the-top and totally controversy-worthy.  Well it's 2006 now.  Blame it on desensitization, but I'm no more desensitized than anyone else that would be wanting to watch this movie.  The hardcore pornography is the only thing that might cause a stir these days, but it won't because you'll see worse things popping up while you browse the internet on any given day.  Violent? HA! Anyone buying this hoping for a fun action-gore movie will be let down.  Here is a summation of the violence and gore in this movie:  Girl gets shotgun.  Girl shoots everyone in the gut in ULTRA SLOW MOTION with shotgun.  Girl also kung-fu's a few dudes in ULTRA SLOW MOTION with unimpressive chops and kicks and throws.  *spoiler* Girl busts a cap in a dude and proceeds to own him in a pretty cool manner involving a hungry hungry horse and a rope. *End Spoiler*.  That's all.  The effects of these people getting shottied to death are horrible.  It looks like something from a bad student film.    I give this movie 2 stars for one reason;  If it were remade today, it might be interesting.  They could jazz it up with some not ULTRA SLOW MOTION fights, some modern special effects, and some frigging music.  I don't think there was 30 seconds worth of music in the whole movie.  No ambience at all.    Plus... an above-average looking girl gets her eye cut out with a scalpel and proceeds to wear an eye patch, which everyone knows is awesome.  
 "The Mermaid's Chair" was a big disappointment after Kidd's spectacular first novel, "The Secret Life of Bees".  A bored woman hooks up with, of all people, a monk, on a barrier island off South Carolina.  Illicit sex in the mud follows, followed by cleaning up, both physically and morally.  Not sure how I got through it--Kidd's descriptions of the the fauna of barrier islands helped 
 This book is just common sense. It takes about 20 minutes to read through the whole thing, but you can get comprable information from any website about hair care. Almost half of it is just the author disputing other people's claims. Would not reccommend purchasing it unless you really don't know anything about your hair.. 
 I ordered what I thought was a full size intro to yoga book and got the pee wee version for elves. I had been breathlessly waiting for my full size edition to arrive in the mail because I was so excited to be starting yoga. As I held the pitifully small thing in my hand I got so depressed because it reminded me of some bad relationships i've had in the past--big promises and nothing to back it up with. I binged on a quart of dulce de leche ice cream and a dozen black bottom cupcakes to try to numb my pain. These evil satanic deceivers must be stopped 
 As a mom of an 8 yo with Asperger's, I am always looking for new ways to help my son.  This book just wasn't helpful to me.  It could be my son's ADHD makes his issues so much different than those she addressed.  I just didn't find anything in there to help him so I didn't bother finishing it.  I borrowed it from the library and for that I am thankful.  
 There must be some movie buffs out there who like this film for whatever reason, like it enough that this movie has been classified as a "cult classic" of sorts. Obviously this is a candidate for inclusion in the Criterion Collection, they have a cross selection of everything from the works of Bergman, Antonioni, Fellini, Godard to the bottom pit of hell with Michael Bay's The Rock and oh dear god, Armageddon! The Man Who Fell to Earth is therefore prime Criterion fare, but is the film itself any good?  Nicolas Roeg is truly a pale imitation of a director. Has he ever made a satisfying film that was not deeply flawed? This David Bowie vehicle is no different with it's oh so 70's mileau. I especially love how time changes throughout the film, you see characters getting older except Bowie who is an alien. Decades pass and the characters age but we are still in the 1970's! Awesome, really!  It goes without saying that this film is another of Roeg's many exercises or rather fixations on the concept of alienation and modern malaise, capitalism, consumerist spending, etc. That these ideas are packaged so blatantly, ( the movie about alienation with an alien! ), and ineptly is shocking to connoisseurs of fine art cinema. If you want to watch great films about the concept of alienation in the modern world, there is no better director than Michaelangelo Antonioni with L'avventura, La Notte and L'eclisse for starters. Nicolas Roeg by compasion is painfully incompetent.  The best part of this film is it's sense of humor, it can be funny in a tacky, empty sort of way. Plus we get lots of nudity and sex, so that's fun, supposedly. Directors by the 1970's were over the whole censorship of the preceding decades and had as much nudity and sex in their art-house movies as possible, because lots of sex and nudity equals profound insight into the human condition! Right? Ugh...   The DVD is high-quality Criterion Collection work, but the quality of the movie is your call. I find it to be utter junk but worth a look, you may have a different opinion after this pretentious mess robs you of 2 hours and 20 minutes of your life. Nicolas Roeg is a fraud, we have to face up to it 
 A glorified cliche, this book does little justice to Shakespeare's writing ability as it isn't nearly his best work. Its marvellous dissemination and public love and recognition beffudles me. Superficial, lackluster, and diaphanous often foolish and loathsome compourtment and intelligence of the characters makes this book nothing more than a wonderful waste of valuable time. Never has Shakespeare created a work so imbued with cliches and idiocy. Basically, Romeo and Juliet is a story about two romantically-impaired "star crossed" lovers who have to avoid the obstacles presented by the feud between their families to realise and consummate their ephemeral marriage. They arent star crossed! They are inane idiots too immersed in "love" to recognize the imprudence of their actions. Their deaths were not the least bit pitiful, but risible. Cognitive, yes. Irritating, yes. Interesting? No. The utter folly of the characters is murderous, very uncharacteristic of Shakespeare who usually presents intelligent and philosophical personages. Do not base your opinion of Shakespeare on this pathetic work, he has created and transcended this one with a myriad of his other much more meaningful and enthralling plays. I d much rather recommend Midsummer Night's Dream or Hamlet 
 I completely recommend this book if you like being underwhelmed, or if you want to be whipped into a catatonic stupor. If you must read it, get it from the library so you won't feel like you did when you bought the Ding King from the TV commercial. (As for the writing style, I'm not sure our president can push a subject against a predicate, at gunpoint.) If this was written by a ghostwriter, he or she should be taken out and shot.  As for the veracity of the text, don't believe it. Karen Hughs, the probable ghostwriter, called up Bush's former national guard base after he became governor, or the national guard's commander-in-chief. She told the commander she wanted to be able to check his records. Translation: I'm going to purge anything bad about him before I write his book.  George's words ring as hollow as his vaunted national guard record and his smirking heir of superiority. This book says that he continued to fly for a number of years, which was patently false. After his two million dollars worth of training, he tried to get a slot in the Air Force post office of another base in Alabama. He was turned down. Then, he refused to take his flight physical. Flight physicals are orders, not requests. Years later, Karen Hughes would tell a cowed press that Bush didn't take the physical because his personal physician was in Houston. No one questioned that these exams are given by Air Force flight surgeons, period.  This book was not only inaccurate, but dull and too self-serving. I recomment it only as a Christmas gift for a person you only pretend to like. (Don't forget to add drums and trumpets for his or her children too.) The collapse should be total.   By page 5 this book was by my bedside as a cure for insomnia. (A Charge to Sleep.) If you have a choice of painting on New Year's Eve and watching it dry, or reading this, go with the paint.   If someone gives this to you, change your home phone number. It can only mean he or she really doesn't like you.  Look for this book in a clearance bin near you.  
 ...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.    John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.    A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.    It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.    It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.  Watchable, but barely.  The Player covered this terrain so much better.  
 Well, I guess I should've read more reviews of this DVD. It is STRICTLY for beginners. I don't sweat and my heart rate barely goes up (if I do breath of fire it helps). When I want an easy day I'll pop this in and do both sessions. Very simple. But I'm sure it's good for a beginner--a BEGINNING BEGINNER. Sara Ivanhoe is soothing though, and encouraging. But seriously, this is a very easy workout 
 I really did love his collaboration with Deepak on Living Beyond Miracles, but I am beginning to grow tired of hearing the same stuff. If you want original and someone who is a gifted writer and humble man, Deepak is so much more of a deep thinker. I get really tired of hearing Wayne regurgitate other people's work. It is as if he doesn't have an original thought without quoting someone else's work.  And when he told the audience thank you for him being able to buy a house on Maui, I was actually a little bit offended in that I felt sorry for the audience. (I saw this on PBS) At first, they laughed and then they actually looked sad after he said it. I have heard him do this in every single audio work I have listened to in some way or another, and it is truly full of the ego he tells us to get away from.  I know we're all human, but there always seems to be a sting in his work that shows how big his head really is. Too bad! Without it, he could change so many more people's lives 
 One of my guilty pleasures is to review science fiction movies over and over again...Maybe I'm hoping the movie will get better with time. Unfortunately "Judge Dredd"  does not! I'm a science fiction fan that can be suckered by mediocre CGI , an action hero star, a comic relief, and a beautiful love interest but please don't mess with the storyline. Maybe thiis is the case for "Future Shock" and too much information was being given out but all in all science fiction deals with the person's humanity and  "Dredd" forces it down our throats too fast and too sugary....In fact , I feel two stars is gviing this movie too much! 
 This is one of the most boring CD's I've ever bought.  Its as if for political reasons the music was cranked out as background to now fairly mainstream anti-war lyrics.  It sounds so computer generated.  Did they really have a drummer or was a drum machine used on every song?  Were the guitar sounds recorded 40 years ago and then mixed into the songs?  If you want anti-Iraq war listen to the Dixie Chicks. 
 where are larger sizes for big chested ladies, we exercise also!! 
 Well, I would like to give this duet of horror stories two-and-a-half stars - almost three. It's not bad. But it just didn't make much of an impression on me.  The first story, "Incident On and Off a Mountain Road" is like a video-game version of the excellent horror film "Wolf Creek." In fact, it seems to land the heroine in a torture shed setting almost identical to the one used in Wolf Creek.   However unlike Wolf Creek, which has a sort of terrifying inevitability to it, this story has - I wouldn't say a twist ending - but a turn-the-tables sort of ending. But that's not enough to bring it up to the level of a really good horror movie. The villain here is an unrealistic, cartoonish figure. And the action devolves into pure gore fest.  "Chocolate," the second story on this DVD, is a little more imaginative and intriguing. But again, another movie does it better. In this case, Chocolate's theme is trumped by the 1970's movie, "The Eyes of Laura Mars."  So there are worthwhile things about this diptych of thrillers. But if you feel the press of limited time and limited life, better to just watch "Wolf Creek" and "The Eyes of Laura Mars," which come off as classics in comparison. 
 this book sucks.  plain and simple.   i have some respect for the author, i've used his libnet and he's a funny guy.. but this book is garbage.  the last good thing mike schiffman wrote was libnet, and after that he figured why not just take it easy and write dumb books like this for the rest of his life, be a manager @stake and get paid way more than the researchers who are doing the actual work.   he goes into stupid crap like backdoors in inetd.conf, how outdated can you get..  what is this?  incident response to that crappy phrack article he wrote years and years ago about simple unix backdoors?  hah.  the real challenge here is for a real hacker to read the whole book and maintain his sanity 
 I think I paid way too much for this extremely slim and small book.  This paperback book measures approximately 3 inches by 5 inches.  About 1/10 of an inch think.  I paid over $5 from Amazon.  The pages can easily be torn by a toddler or preschooler.  It's just way too small to read to several children at once.  Everyone is complaining that they can't see it 
 I haven't read the two preceding books, but I sincerely hope that they are better than this one.  I'd like to think that a federal judge would have better sense than to keep an obviously raped 6 year old in the woods for a week "until she learns to trust him."  Meanwhile, her poor mother is searching town after town with no indication from him that she is even alive.  I feel very doubtful that said mother, on discovery of the man with her suddenly verbal child, would say to him, "I would have done the same thing in your shoes."  Even knowing that he wasn't the original kidnapper, I'm pretty sure I would have sent my daughter out of the room and shot him anyway.    No thanks to Ramsey, the kid hasn't died from internal injuries, and now that the mother (who is far, far more clever than every incompetent law enforcement agent in Colorado) followed the only solid lead that the police "blew off" and is back with her daughter, I think I'll leave them to go on the run without me.    Lazy writing -- it wouldn't have been hard to create a situation where Ramsey and the child together made sense.  
 I felt this book was to much like other ghost story collections and really embelished a great deal of facts 
 If you have listened to the original cd you will find this one to be  terrible. It can never be as good as the original.  Also Snoop Dogg screwes  up in Gangsta Gangst 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 Neither beginners nor practitioners should ever buy this book, this is one of the books from a bunch of books that Fabozzi has edited on ABS and almost all of them are not worth looking into, it is neither a plesant reading nor mathematically adequate. This book like other Fabozzi's books on fixed income bypasses serious issues related to investment, risk and analysis 
 This is a terrible product. It is too big for your BlackBerry. They send it with another door for the backside because your current door won't fit over this huge battery!!  It is frankly unbelievable that BlackBerry, and Amazon, would foist this product on us.  The battery is so big that the device will no longer fit into your BlackBerry holster.  DO NOT BUY THIS IDIOTIC PRODUCT 
 If you are an animal lover, beware.  After reading part of Chapter 5 "Will You Be Amazed?", I closed the book for good.  Yes, I was amazed.  The author doesn't believe that animals have eternal souls.  Out of all the multitude of books I've read, this is the only one that eliminates the idea of our beloved animals in heaven.  Rest assured, if we make it to heaven, they will too, indeed.  In fact, we are also animals, mammals, just as our beloved dog & cat friends are!  So what I've read in Chapter 5 doesn't make any sense.  I'm very disappointed & won't ever recommend this book to anyone 
 A plain-looking girl with the most horrible name a mother could invent EVER-Herculeah!-loves solving mysteries,and -I give the author credit that they don't just fall into Herculeah's lap from nowhere;instead she likes to solve the mysteries that her mum-a private investigator-is working on-she is trying to work out ifn escaped loony-bin patient is really dangerous.I would not buy another Herculeah mystery,although it was OK.I am also aware that this review inludes an abnormally long sentence.Oh well.Bye 
 If you read between the lines on all these glowing reviews, you will find out that this is a ridiculous movie with some good (not great) acting.  Jessica Lange basically does an impression of Marilyn Monroe with a southern accent.  Well not all of the time, since her accent seems to come and go.  The amount of effort that you will spend trying to suspend your disbelief will negate any good qualities this movie has.  Skip it unless you really, really, really love Jessica Lange.  By the way, if this movie is set in the early sixties, why does the daughter have a peace sign on her bedroom wall?  This is the same daughter that finds a grenade in a drawer and promptly pulls the pin and tosses it to her boyfriend! Puh-lease 
 This product was very interesting and informative.  Difficult to follow detox rules are made much easier with this product that breaks down each stage and day into an easy to follow cue card format.  A lot of info is consisely written into a cue card format 
 It seems like Bartov decided upon the results of his research first, then cherry-picked whatever sources he could find to "demonstrate" that the Wehrmacht became "nazified". He makes sweeping generalisations based upon flimsy evidence and poor logic, then expands upon the results to make even more flawed conclusions.  For an excellent critique, see   [... 
 The first Saw movie was like a breathe of fresh air to the genre.  It wasn't a PG-13 rated teen fest or a remake of a classic 70's horror film either, and while it wasn't perfect, it still managed to deliver the goods with a little bit of originality thrown in.  Saw II picks up where the first film left off, with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) playing another game with a group of people; among whom is survivor Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and the son (Erik Knudsen) of crooked detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) who is forced to play along as well.  Replacing James Wan as director, Darren Lynn Bousman ups the ante in terms of grotesqueness and the design of Jigsaw's game, but the story (originally based on an older story by Bousman that was later transformed into Saw II) isn't close to being as engaging as it was the first time around, and besides Bell, Smith, and Wahlberg; the rest of the cast (including a returning Dina Meyer, along with Glen Plummer, 7th Heaven's Beverly Mitchell, Franky G, and Emmanuelle Vaugier) range from grating to awful.  There's some pretty good gore effects, and the scenarios offer some imagination, but Saw II is a far step down from the original.  All in all, Saw II isn't horrible, but it's definitely the worst entry in the series by far 
 Just another of the endless sagas, with much detail but little story!  The characters get on their horses and off, they tie them up, talk for a while, then get on again;  The author repeats this cycle over and over again with a little action thrown in every 70 pages or so!  If you love minute detail and endless repetition then you'll love this book 
 Unfortunately I was disappointed in this CD as I did not remember that there were practically no lyrics to any of the music that was played throughout the movie 
 There are limited texts on East Asian history and it is unfortunate that this author decided to spike his with unabashed personal commentary.  Overall, the content is impressive but some of Murphey's claims are hard to stomach.      An example of such outlandish claims is the theme in later chapters that American Cold War policy drove Asian Communists to a harder line by resisting them with military campaigns and non-democratic governments.  Murphey insinuates that Mao Zedong, Ho Chi Min, and other Communist leaders had more moderate programs planned for when they came to power but were forced into reeducation programs and political purges because of American policy.    Besides this outright opinion paraded as fact, Murphey also annoyingly snickers and gripes with hyphenated and parenthetical commentary.  There are also facts suspiciously left out.  For example, Murphey spends a great deal of effort detailing conservative corruption in earlier Korean politics but mentions nothing of the massive scandals accompanying the end of Kim Dae-Jun's term.  Lastly, many of Murphey's dubious claims can not be investigated by the readers.  Facts are not referenced and a bibliography of only 40 sources is available at the end -- suspiciously thin for a work of this magnitude and considering the many "facts" quoted.  Murphey's bias and this lack of sourcing make this book marginally useful for graduate level research, unless one is willing to accept the good professor at his word.  The Ivory Tower is alive and well in Ann Arbor 
 1. The Twelve Steps do not work as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems.  The A.A. failure rate ranges from 95% to 100%. Sometimes, the A.A. success rate is actually less than zero, which means that A.A. indoctrination is positively harmful to people, and prevents recovery. Some tests have shown that even receiving no treatment at all for alcoholism is much better than receiving A.A. treatment:  One of the most enthusiastic boosters of Alcoholics Anonymous, Professor George Vaillant of Harvard University, who is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), showed by his own 8 years of testing of A.A. that A.A. was worse than useless -- that it didn't help the alcoholics any more than no treatment at all, and it had the highest death rate of any treatment program tested -- a death rate that Professor Vaillant himself described as "appalling". While trying to prove that A.A. treatment works, Professor Vaillant actually proved that A.A. kills. After 8 years of A.A. treatment, the score with Dr. Vaillant's first 100 alcoholic patients was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.  (Nevertheless, Vaillant is still a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, and he still wants to send all alcoholics to A.A. anyway, to "get an attitude change by confessing their sins to a high-status healer." That is cult religion, not a treatment program for alcoholism.)  The A.A. dropout rate is terrible. Most people who come to A.A. looking for help in quitting drinking are appalled by the narrow-minded atmosphere of fundamentalist religion and faith-healing. The A.A. meeting room has a revolving door. The therapists, judges, and parole officers (many of whom are themselves hidden members of A.A. or N.A.) continually send new people to A.A., but those newcomers vote with their feet once they see what A.A. really is. Even A.A.'s own triennial surveys, conducted by the A.A. headquarters (the GSO), say that:  81% of the newcomers are gone within 30 days,  90% are gone in 3 months, and  95% are gone at the end of a year.  That automatically gives A.A. a failure rate of at least 95%. But the GSO does not count all of those people who only attend a few meetings before quitting -- they don't qualify as "members". (That amounts to "cherry-picking".) If we included them, then the numbers would be much worse.    First there is the propaganda technique of "everybody's doing it": "AA or a similar Twelve-Step program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries".  That is a complete falsehood. The vast majority of the successful people recover without A.A. or any "support group". It's what "everybody" is doing.  Then they use the propaganda techniques of use of the passive voice and vague suggestions: "It is widely believed that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can put a recovering addict on the road to relapse."  It is widely believed by whom? And what do those unnamed people know? What are their qualifications? Are they doctors? Medical school professors? Or salesmen for a 12-Step treatment center? Why should we care what some unnamed invisible fools allegedly believe, anyway?  The authors also use the propaganda technique of fear-mongering: you will be "on the road to relapse" -- you will probably die -- unless you practice Bill Wilson's Twelve Step cult religion.  And then the fluff-headed Pollyanna attitude is outrageous: Just going to the wonderful A.A. meetings is supposedly all that is needed to fix some alcoholics.  But since A.A. has a zero-percent success rate above and beyond the normal rate of spontaneous remission, that cannot possibly be true.   
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
 I am a Trevanian maniac. I buy every used copy of Shibumi I can find, just in case the world ends and I am left to wander the rubble with no chance of a new edition of Shibumi. get it? I love Trevanian. This new book? More closely resembled something my cat coughed up than Shibumi. Reading this new one, I was praying for the end of the world, just so I didn't have to finish the book. I finally tossed it aside after three hundred pages. Look, I understand that Trevanian prides himself on being a master of every  genre. Maybe I was the only one who loved Incident at Twenty Mile. But I found this new book to be boring, trite, petty, and poorly written, and it gets one star because, as a Trevanian diehard, I have no choice 
 Luther Krank and his wife decide, since their only daughter has joined the Peace Corps and will be away, not to decorate for Christmas and go on a cruise instead. Their Christmas-decorating-frenzied neighbors are incensed by this and make life miserable for the Kranks--as if decorating for Christmas was mandatory and everyone has to have singing and dancing lights and a plastic Frosty on their roof to be happy. Then the Kranks' daughter decides to come home unexpectedly, with a boyfriend she wants to show her family's wonderful Christmas celebrations and the couple has to scramble to do things at the last minute and the ingrate neighbors are no help. Granted, Luther isn't the most likeable character, but I truly felt bad for him with this wretched bunch of insensitive, asinine neighbors, and his wife, who completely turns around and repudiates him. The only thing nice that happens in this book is something Luther does at the end to some neighbors who are having a hard time. I didn't find this funny at all; I found it appalling. If I were the Kranks, I'd pull up stakes and move the moment their daughter leaves again 
 I don't think you can really write a book to teach someone to be funny.  Fortunately the author does not even attempt that task.  Judy talks a lot on the structure of jokes and setting up punch lines.  I guess I have a hard time buying into this cookie cutter approach of humor.  I have not yet read her latest book so I can't speak to that but I would not recommend buying this book 
 I was so hyped to read this book ~~ really, I was. I thought, man, "When the Wind Blows" was really good and intense (and surprisingly, rather better-written than a lot of his other books) ~~ so I picked this one up and was hugely disappointed. I finished this book simply because I wanted to know how it ended. I kept turning the pages in hope that maybe just maybe that it would evolve into a wonderful story and all the questions would be answered.  I shouldn't have bothered. The first half was a replica of "When the Wind Blows" and the second half was just repetition of previous paragraphs; no depth to the characters and it was so poorly written, that I just cringe whenever I think of my English teachers struggling to teach decent grammar to their students. I learned absolutely nothing new. It wasn't suspenseful. It didn't provide any shocking revelations. It was just a disappointment. It felt like he was hurrying through this novel so he could write another one. Whatever happened to taking the time to hone a craft?   Anyways, this book focuses on Max and the other bird-children who have been snatched away from Frannie and Kit, whom they considered their parents. Max has a great secret and she knew that they're being hunted again. While living with their biological parents, all the children were separated, taunted, teased and made miserable by humans who didn't understand them. Longing to be with Frannie and Kit again, Frannie and Kit weren't even together. Frannie was still in Colorado while Kit was back in D.C., doing his job as a FBI agent. Max and Matthew were being hunted again for capture, so everyone got together to outwit the enemies who supposedly have this great secret.   If you're a die-hard Patterson fan, then buy this book. If you're not ~~ don't bother as it's not as good as "When the Wind Blows."   11-21-0 
 The breakdance trio are back . this time around they're trying to stop the demolition of a community center. And at the same time solve some personal issues , like kelly's - Lucinda dickey - theater dancing career , ozone's  - adolfo quinines - feelings towards Kelly and turbo's - Michael chambers - love interest .   If the first movie was great and full of amazing breakdancing , cool music and acceptable story , then this sequel is the complete opposite . you get bad acting , bad choreography , bad music and  bad costume design . even ICE T sucked in this film . what a waste of good dancing talents.  But , If you liked the first movie , like me , then you can't resist  buying this sequel. at least you'll see turbo's ceiling dance . the best thing in the film .ozone cheesy roof dancing and kelly's not that bad acting .  Otherwise avoid . 
 This is so buzzword laden, I really couldn't make out what the guy was driving at. I abandoned it midway through the first chapter 
 this book wasnt as fantastical as i thought it was going to be. I had heard puzo was a good writer so picked it up and got bored about three quaters the way through the first page. Im not saying not to read this "novel" but it might work better as a coffe table.. 
 Very easy to set up, but no matter what I did, I got several horizontal interference bars.  One very nice feature is a built in video modulator that allows you to connect to older TVs using a coax cable instead of RCA.  I am returning this product 
 It's ideas are sound, but it's all stats. This year there was this much and hey look now it's tripled, quadrupled, whatever... Just reading the conclusions of each chapter will give you everything that you need to know. 
 A fascinating story that succeeds somehow despite the terrible writing.  It as if the authors simply assembled at random the chapters and, in many cases, whole paragraphs within any given chapter.  There is no discernable  flow or organization to the tale -- chronoglogical or otherwise -- and it  is difficult to follow the events being described.  As acknolwedged in one  of the introductions, it appears that the book was all too hastily thrown  together in the face of a looming deadline.  Still, the story is worth  reading for software engineers, entrepreneurs and others involved in the VC  industry 
 Well, well, here's Steve Flower's ( alias Edred Thorsson's ) latest edition of sucker bait for wanna-be Vikings! Step right up, folks! Get it while its hot!  Why do I call it "sucker bait"? For the plain and simple reason that there is NOTHING left of ANY Old Norse spiritual/sorcery practices to be found ANYWHERE...except bits, pieces, and disjointed fragments....none of which can be fit into anything remotely resembling a coherent "system" or set of practices, much less be made into entire "courses" of "majick".  What Steven Flowers has done in this book ( and in all his other works ) is to take some, many, or almost all of these bits/pieces/fragments of information on Old Norse beliefs, and sprinkle them over a system of majick that is NOT connected to them at all ( a la Setian and other Middle Eastern elements added in ).  In other words, if you think you're getting anything close to Old Norse/Teutonic spirituality in any of Flower's books, you're crazier than a hedge fence! The beloved Church with all its Jesus-loves-me fanatics made sure to obliterate as much of Old Norse/Teutonic/Northern European paganism as humanly possible, and to top it all off, they also distorted accounts of historic events and of long-dead persons to make them look as diabolical as possible. For example; I remember reading of some Asatru loonies raving with wide-eyed enthusiasm over how "the old viking women would make shirts lined with fish hooks for their children to wear to toughen them up"! Of course, the Asatru loonies couldn't possibly comprehend that this was Christian story telling about pre-Christian Europeans! Instead, these imbecilic "true believers" bought into the idea of their ancestors deliberately torturing their young children by having them wear shirts lined with fish hooks! What makes more sense, a pagan doing that to her children, or a Christian scribe ( who himself loved whips and torture to get closer to "god" ) inventing such nonsense? But you see, when you've got unquestioning True Believers, you've got suckers you can sell anything to - including the scholarly-sounding, complex, highly pollished "stuff" Steven Flowers ( alias Edred Thorsson ) has been churning out.  Now, you want to practice this "Stuff"? Go ahead! Nothing wrong with it. Just remember that you are NOT practicing ANYTHING connected to genuine Old Norse/Teutonic spirituality, since that belief system has been lost forever thanks to the zealous efforts of crack pot Christians of the post-Viking age in Northern Europe.  And if Flowers overlays various bits, pieces, and fragments of Old Norse/Teutonic concepts and beliefs onto something Setian or Golden Dawn-ish, well then go ahead and follow it if you want. Again, there's nothing really wrong with practicing this "stuff" because at least it counters the "love, light, rainbow" kookiness of Christianity and Wicca and other "New Age" drivel. But please don't even try to convince yourself that what you're following is "THE REAL THING" in terms of Norse/Teutonic majickal systems. Cause it just ain't! Its as modern as can be and is just dusted over with some disjointed remnants of the pagan age of Northern Europe to give it the proper "flavor". 
 I love Beatrice Small's books but I can honestly say that this book is an exception. I felt that the heroine Rosemunde was a shallow character. She supposedly had this heart stopping love for Patrick Leslie and as soon as an osbstacle comes between the two, like loss of memory, she splits. Whatever, happened to that love that was going to last forever for Rosemunde, obviously she wasn't in love with Patrick Leslie that much. The guy she winds up finally marrying is a narcotic stalker. Definitely,not one of her better books 
 The cover of this film says "If you loved THE MISSION and THE APOSTLE(which I did!) then you will LOVE MOLOKAI!"........Sorry....I didn't!This film cannot even begin to be compared with those wonderful films.Paul Cox's direction of such talent as Sir Derek Jacobi and Peter O'Toole is an utter travesty.David Wenham is positively laughable as Father Damien.The screenplay dialogue is sheer dribble and the film is as static as static can be.What SHOULD have been a riveting retelling of Hawaii's "dirty little secret" is reduced to pure nonsense and cliche deplorably acted by all parties.Even the breathtaking cinematography of the Hawaiian Islands (which was minimal at best) could not bring salvation to  this leperous bore!Even the film BLACKROBE was better than this 
 This book is lacking substance.  She talks about Zen & it's teachings.  I'm not interested in reading about Zen.  I don't share her opinion in writing practice.  I believe quality is more important than quantity.  
 Audition apparently seems to be some kind of unwanted stepchild of Adobe, based on the scarcity of resources Adobe seems to have dedicated to it. I bought this book based on other positive experiences with the "Visual Quickstart Guide" series, but as another reviewer states, this book barely covers what should essentially be in a basic user's manual. There is little if any detail, very few case-study example, and some significant holes in the instructions.   Example: in the "Using Cues" section - there is a section "to list and edit your cues," to "move cues" and to "delete cues"...but it says nothing about creating a cue to start with. These types of omissions can drive beginners insane, and signals some pretty bad editing.  Further, abstract explanations of sounds (or worse, how sounds work) are nearly useless. This book badly needs an accompanying cd. Five seconds of actual audio can teach more that fifty pages of words. Avoid this book 
 I'm sure this is a very nice book, just like the Writer's Market books about agents and publishers. The problem with these books is that unless you have a close personal friend in the publishing business or the theatre world, you will never get anything published or produced. No book can help you do that. It's a matter of luck and coincidence, and if you weren't lucky enough to go to college with someone in the business, you're out in the cold, and no book will alter that fact for you. Have a nice day 
      Moreover, much of  this character development takes the form of chirpy asides and dense, introspective naval gazing.  When the action finally begins it is invariably accompanied by a maximum of discussion.       Reading this book was a bit of a chore, not worth the effort invested 
 My wife bought this for me.  I was really looking forward to listening, but I found it a painful experience.  I not sure if it is the song choices, the production values, the arrangements or a combination, but the album overall is just a huge disappointment.  No songs from it have made it on to my Ipod 
 If you like nurture arguments more than nature, read this book. He actually uses sociopath and psychopath meaning one who is socialized into becoming a psychopath versus one who is born. I don't agree with it, nor do the foremost experts on the subject. If you enjoy sociobiological explanations for rape and murder and psychopathy, then it's probably for you. For those of you who think, however, read Without Conscience by Hare, he is a foremost expert on the subject and doesn't meander through an essay on why he thinks people are psychopaths, but gives portraits of psychopathy and doesn't shy away from the fact that much of antisocial disorder and psychopathy occurs randomly. This is NOT a good book. It's full of irrelevant information and just plain wrong conclusions 
 Small holes, unstable, no space for the bum. My daughter cried everytime we tried it. We had a Pool School deluxe baby float before but we left it at the pool and it dissapeared. She loved that one. I could not find it in the store so I bought the Swim School and am regretting it. Buy the Pool School! 
 Season three of Enterprise is one of the primary reasons the show was cancelled.  Ratings dropped during this season and the announcement of the show's cancellation came before the superior season 4 could save it.  The problem with season three is that nearly every episode deals directly with the Xindi threat.  Long story arcs have happened in Star Trek before, such as the Dominion Wars in DS9.  The problem with the Xindi arc is that there are too few "change of pace" episodes.  Having three out of every four episodes about the same stroyline is boring.  There was not enough variety in this season.  It became quite redundant and I was quite happy when it ended.  Plus, there was no real suspense.  It was obvious that Earth was not going to be destroyed, so the outcome was not enough to keep one on the seat of his/her pants.  Season 4 was much better, but unfortunately couldn't save the show.  The idea of shorter story arcs was excellent, given the poor ratings they got in the previous season.  These mini-arcs were somewhat unique in the world of Star Trek, but worked much better than the mega-arc that was season 3 
  After reading the book Medicine Woman and the San Francisco Review of Books on the back which says this is an Autobiographical I have to question a few things.     I come from Manitoba and have lived there over 50 years.  I've never heard of a Crowley and the Cree First Nations in Manitoba that I was raised with would not be seeing a Kokopelli or a Kachina.  It's not part of their culture.  The last and final huge mistake is the fact that most of this story could not have taken place outside without huge huge bottles of mosquitoe repellant as anyone who lives in the bush in Manitoba knows especially those who may have a reason to go naked in the woods.  Perhaps Lynn shouldn't be peddling her strange brand of spiritualism as true when it's not.  There are enough charlatans in the world without one stealing someone's culture and calling it her own for the sake of the almight dollar.    Carol 
 The hullabaloo surrounding the book will lead one to believe that this is an epitome of all adventure/suspense stories. In reality, the book is nothing but a wanderings of a disturbed mind, disillusioned with life and suffering from abnormalities of mind - so common among soldiers after attending a bloody war. Those readers who praise the book sky-high must have some ulterior motive in mind; otherwise this is a shoddy piece of work and written obviously with a film script in mind rather than a book, which anyways what Hilton was, scriptwriter in Hollywood!  His other tiny book  Goodbye Mr. Chips is a better read and doesn't pretend to be something else or is it we who label a book. No wonder Lost Horizon is out of print and should remain so. I don't blame the writer as much as the so-called critics, readers and other writers for whom the world begins in Western Europe and ends in North America. A very myopic view!    
 If "wear a tiara to the grocery store" is the type of advice you're looking for- you'll love this 
 .............Is not functional................ . If you are reading this then you are Gump-y! And, you and I must be family.  First, I love Amazon; they are the consistent type of e-merchant.  And that's good! But but but but, why?:  would a designated (by me) upper "echelon" merchant like Amazon carry this Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). It simply is not functional information that I stored Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) is gone, or not readable. I am surprised that Amazon did not catch-on/up with the problem.  The product won't retain any info then I had to store less and less information on the card, so that my info is able to stay on the card another 6 hours. I decided to contact Amazon, they were very shortly, and cordially sent me a replacement Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768), with the paperwork for returning the original Sandisk 2gb compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768).  Then I got something that:  A.	Did, have the shape of a 2gig Sandisk CF card;  B.	Did, have the Sandisk label that says Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768)......;  C.	And did have the original shiny factory Sandisk package. None-being the-less 3 different computers later and 2 hour had passed couldn't recognize what is inserted into the CF reader.  D.	The brand new replacement card I got with the original factory wrapping, that's brand new and untouched and unrecognized by computers. One may safely assume (pardon the facetiousness), Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768), is yet to be recognized.   From Amazon, twice in the mail, I got a Sandisk 2 GB compact which flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768). Both cards I received had a problem. And therefore, it is safe to assume that Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) production have a major glitch. I mean, the memory card cannot be used for memory purposes. I have to yet see what or for what, other than memory, can I utilize a memory card. I beg your pardon, but in essence I am trying to imply that... The Sandisk products were a joke! :-).  Being the consistent e-merchant that Amazon always been, Amazon agreed to return them. This was not a surprise (coming from Amazon).  In essence, I strongly urge any person that makes a living, and tries to have some fun with their hard earned living to: 1.	Not be fooled. If you see Sandisk, run away as fast as possible,  2.	You'll lose it all in a matter of a day or so.  3.	Sandisk 2GB compact flash card type I (sdcfb-2048-768) is not compatible with data storage! or even short transfers of data, from a home computer to work. 4.	Spend the extra.... on an alternative brand.  5.	That's the only way you'll get a CF card that is correctly labeled; and, serve intended functions.  6.	I strongly recommend, as well as urge individual who is thinking of  getting that "other" brand of 2-giga...... cards to make sure do so:................ 7.	Use Amazon only, and don't be fooled by any other e-merchant who's not as high of an echelon as Amazon....... Amazon!  8.	Had it not been for Amazon, I would have lost all I paid. :).  God bless Amazon for their extreme timely tentativeness, I also pray for Sandisk, so that god renders it with the power to accomplish the purpose they stick onto their product line. God bless, and keep on shopping. 
 The story is ok, but the acting is a bit off and the movie drags to much... but if your looking for some raunchy sex  there is a non-simulated oral sex scene in it 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 I have glorious white hair, and I thought this would be good for it.  But it seems to dry my hair too much, and frankly I don't see that it's any better than the two dollar bottle of Suave that's out there. I've also used Lush's BIG shampoo and Soak 'n' Float shampoo bars, and I like them much better. 
 I am a big fan of Dee Henderson.  When I read the O'Malley series, I could not put them down.  I was hooked from page one and never lost interest.  Because I was such a big fan, I was excited to go to a Christian bookstore and see her latest work, "Before I Wake."  I could not wait to get home and start reading it.  What a disappointment.  She took 381 pages to say what could have been said in half that.  It was extremely wordy.  I found myself falling asleep at times and had to re-read sections several times.    I kept reading though, just knowing from past experience that it was going to get better.  It never did.  When I finished the last page I turned back and re-read the last few pages to see if I missed something, and discovered I didn't.  My first thought was that I was missing pages.  There was no ending!!!  You suffer through 381 pages of boring text to find out that it led to nowhere.  Ms Henderson is much better than this!!  If you don't believe it, just pick up any one of the O'Malley series.  You'll be spellbound!  Also, the editor missed countless spelling and grammatical errors.  Should never have gone to press like that.  Sorry Dee!  I know you'll do better with the sequal.   
 I was disappointed with how dirty the book was.  I had to remove a dead insect from one of the chapters.  
 If you are a student of landscape architecture, it would be in your best interest to stay away from this book. It is truly outdated. The graphics here are mediocre at best (at the time of publication). Don't waste your money or time on this style of drawing. Unless Mr. Reid publishes a new and updated How-to book, I would think that this book will be out of print (hopefully soon). It is critical that students learn to draw and draw well, both by hand and computer. This book will not help in either endeavor. If you as a student of landscape architecture use this book to learn to draw the landscape, don't count on working as a Landscape Architect upon graduation. You will be lucky to find a job as a janitor in the office building of a second-rate 2person; design-build; landscape design office 
 These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply 
 It is obvious that they have a lot of talent.  The first song has a lot of energy and is quite good.  But after that, the tempo of all the songs is moderato at the fastest.  Most of the songs that were chosen were just to slow of songs.  It does not match up to the caliber of Bond, where I thought it would have 
 no monsters in there worth buying the book. Stick with the first monster manual. 
 We bought this humidifier as the low-cost alternative when our kids were sick this week.  It's horrible!  We're returning it today!  When this unit is running, it leaks water between the reservoir and motor units.  Overnight it leaked enough water to completely saturate a folded up large bath towel I placed under it!  Two days later & the towel is still wet!  Additionally, the unit is noisy, spits out water droplets with the mist, and is very difficult to clean (oddly shaped water reservoir makes it impossible to completely empty the unit).  If you need a humidifier, buy a different product 
 I PLACED A WRONG ORDER AND SO NOW I AM NOT ABLE TO WATCH THE DVD I PURCHASED. IT WAS  FOR AREA NO 1, BUT WE CAN'T WATCH THE NO 1 AREA MOVIES IN TURKEY. THEREFORE I DO NOT HAVE A REVIEW  
 Carolyn Chute is well able to evoke a sense of place in which these  Northeastern hillbillies live by describing the detritus of their yards as  well as their lives.  However, the story meanders--again, not unlike the  aimless day-to-day existence of the characters she describes. Her  characterization provides the Beans and their friends and neighbors with a  rough dignity, although not enough to keep them from seeming pitiable to a  "sophisticated" urban readership 
 + Defacto standard + Accompanying WebCourse  - Too deep if used as an intro book; lacks solutions if used for a reference book - It's HUGE!; hard to carry around  = Tries to appease too wide an audience.  Definately attractive to professors who already know the information and feel this is THE book yet probably too deep for an intro algorithms class.  Wish there was a searchable pdf version that came with the book on a CD as well as odd numbered solutions. 
 Since he is the famous writer and I'm just a reader, it must me be. But I find stuff written in the first person and the present time a nuisance. Having read almost all of Hiaasen's books, this one was like a cold shower. I sometimes actually doubted that he had written it himself 'cause often the phraseology is so totally not the Hiaasen I got used to 
 I received Turner's book "The Hidden World of Birthdays" and Gary Goldschneider's book, "The Secret Langugage of Birthdays" as Christmas presents. I became fascinated with the subject after reading Goldschneider's book years ago in a library, which seemed accurate to me.   I had similar high hopes for Turner's book. I thought it would be an in depth study of astrology and birthdays. Her study is advice that, in my opinion, could be found online or in any book about astrology. The personality profiles she gives for each birthday is general, unhelpful and sometimes stupid. For example, on one birthday she gives the advice, of "Health Scent: Lavender--This scent might lead others to trust you and make you patient." Excuse me, but how can a specific scent lead others to trust you more? Or, on another she gives the Possessions and Desires, "Crocus: You may spend too much time stewing over those who have innocently harmed you." Turner doesn't give an explanation for why each of these flowers, charms, or colors are right for each birthday.   Turner doesn't give any historical background for why certain stones, numbers, etc; would be good for one birthday as opposed to another. Nor does she explain how she develops the numerological numbers for each birthday. Another thing noticeably absent from Turner's book is that she doesn't have any descriptions about each one of the astrological signs or their "element" (i.e. fire, water, earth, air) and how they relate to one another.  In fact, Turner's book was so bad, the person who gave me the gift initially told me to trash it.   One might ask why I'm being so harsh on Turner? It's because I believe she's borrowed the "personology" premise from Gary Goldschneider and Joost Elffers in "The Secret Language of Birthdays" who do a much better job than she does. Each profile is more in depth, and they include names of famous people born on your birthday, as well as meditations, numerological and tarot cards related to your birthday profile, as well as specific explanations of how they developed them. At the beginning of Goldschneider's book there are definitions/personality traits of each specific astrological sign. Each sign is then divided into four groups (which includes the "cusp" group) and with personality traits and advice for each group. For example, Virgo is divided into Virgo I, Virgo II, Virgo III and the Virgo-Libra Cusp. It includes information about colors, plants, foods,composers,etc; attractions, and life path "themes" for each sign and the stage of human life that every sign represents. There's also an astrological chart included and an index to look up famous people and their birthdays. Turner's book has a few of these features, along with angels for each birth date, but no explanatory notes about why they're used for each day.  If you're looking for a great astrological study, there is no comparison:  skip Turner's book altogether and go with Goldschneider and Elffers's "The Secret Language of Birthdays." 
 I didn't care for the way  that each chapter was written about the thoughts of each family member, except for the murderous son.  We never hear much from him. Enjoyed the beginning, then I kept skipping pages waiting to read about what really happened.  The family didn't seem bothered that their son had killed a girl, rather that he may go to jail.  The mother was the only one who showed some concern for the girl's parents.  The book could have gone into more detail about the trial, but most of the book was about the father's thoughts.  Don't recommend it.  When I saw Merryl Streep was in the movie version, I know the movie must be pretty slow moving, as are all of Merryl's movies.  
 Before I start, let me nail my colours to the mast: I'm pro-science, I'm pro-evolution, I really like the idea of rational enquiry and I'm a sceptic bordering on the cynical. I'm *not* some lentil-munching, kaftan-wearing, feng-shui-hugging hippie with airbrushed unicorns and a yin-yang sign on the side of my Kombi. Honestly.  Now we've got that cleared up, let me say it straight: This book takes on some big arguments, but, other than humorously swatting some flies, loses hands down. All it succeeds in doing is illustrating that there are fakers, losers, charlatans and wankers to be found in the Social Sciences departments of any given University. Anyone who's been to university and didn't know that deserves a clip around the ear and to be sent to the back of the class. Now either Sokal didn't know that ( - ~clip~ -), or he's spent half his book shooting fish in a barrel. That might seem like good sport, but before long it becomes obvious it's a cheap thrill.  Having said that, I sincerely doubt that the titillation of seeing dumb French Feminists taken apart is what made this book such a splash: I think it's because of Sokal's purported intent: to undermine the notion of cognitive relativism, especially as it associated with modern philosophy of science, in particular the work of Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend. This is the battle: Sokal aligns with those who say scientists are the exclusive purveyors of a shining light called truth; the Barbarians at the gate are these simpering postmodernists who want to tear the temple down.  While the poseurs cited in this book are certainly (for the most part) phoneys or idiots, I think Thomas Kuhn was neither, and while Paul Feyerabend overplayed the court jester hand, he had some important things to say too.  So, to the first point: Proving that one writer (or a hundred, or a thousand) who purports to adhere to relativism is a charlatan doesn't establish anything about *the idea* of relativism. All you have established is that you have a found yourself a charlatan. Give yourself a star.   But while you're pinning it on, remember that postmodernists do not have a monopoly on illogical, bamboozling, balderdash:  Example: Sir Roger Penrose (Emeritus Rouse Ball professor of mathematics at Oxford University, no less) and his dreadful, lumpen-headed, and deliberately bamboozling anti-AI tract "The Emperor's New Mind". The very point of the (no doubt correct but nonetheless entirely irrelevant) science deluged on the reader in that book is to obscure the fact that the real emperor was Roger Penrose and his arguments on AI really blow the kumara.   Example: Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker's Linguistic Nativism, which has held sway for a good thirty years in many linguistics departments, and is anything but post-modern: nativism holds that humans have an innate understanding of grammar hard wired into their biology. From my paltry readings in linguistics and the philosophy of language, my impression is that Pinker's and Chomsky's arguments are seriously flawed. (See: Sampson: "The Language Instinct Debate" for a thorough linguistic critique of nativism; see Rorty: "Contingency Irony, and Solidarity" for a philosophical perspective on the contingency of language). Make note of this example, as it becomes relevant later on.  Secondly, Sokal and Bricmont (quite deliberately) refuse to engage on certain topics, in particular on cultural or aesthetic relativism, which they say (without providing a reason) "raise very different issues". Take that star away, for this statement betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about relativism. Actually, ethical, aesthetic and cognitive relativisms raise different manifestations of *exactly* the same issue: Cognitive relativism, in that it relates to "epistemic" truth (as opposed to "moral" truth or "aesthetic" truth - both of which seem intuitively more questionable ideas) is simply a cut closer to the quick: indeed, the aesthetic and moral brands of relativism rely for their plausibility on cognitive relativism anyway (i.e. if the truths we understand about the physical universe are contingent on our language, then it follows that ideals of right and wrong and beauty must be similarly contingent on our language).  Thirdly, Sokal provides the following account of cognitive relativism:   "While scientists ... try to obtain an objective view ... of the world, relativist thinkers tell them that they are wasting their time and that such an enterprise is, in principle, an illusion"  Now that, to put it mildly, is a *very* punchy version of relativism, and not one that any credible relativist philosopher I know of (and certainly not Thomas Kuhn, who spent a whole book explaining how and why the process scientific discovery works) subscribes to.  That is, in the trade, known as a straw-man argument: You set it up to knock it over. Here goes:   P1: Relativists say science is a waste of time P2: Science helps us reliably predict and react coherently to phenomena occurring in the world  P3: Things which help to predict and react to such phenomena have genuine utility  C1: Therefore, science has genuine utility C2: Ergo, science is not a waste of time  Case closed. Is relativism dead? No: the problem is, most relativists I know would completely agree with all of the above argument except for premise 1. The cat is most definitely still out of the bag. (In a nutshell, all reasonably stated relativism says is that you can't know that your theory actually maps onto the actual configuration of the outside world; it may, it may not: logically there will always be some other possible explanation for the same set of data, however implausible or difficult to imagine, and in part that difficulty in imagination may be a function of the historical contingency of our belief in, and description of the world in terms of, the current "paradigm". Relativism simply says the best you can do is to know that, for now, your theory works, not that it is *true*. Though Sokal and Bricmont may disagree, I don't think this is controversial amongst philosophers nor, really, scientists.)  Lastly, in criticising an admittedly utterly ludicrous passage bestowed on the world by that splendidly silly feminist philosopher Sylvia Kristeva, Sokal makes the following footnote:  "...Kristeva seems to be appealing ... to the 'Sapir-Whorf thesis' in linguistics that is ...that our language radically conditions our view of the world. This thesis nowadays is sharply criticised by some linguists: see, for example Pinker ..."  Hold the phone. The implication is that the Sapir-Whorf thesis (as to the contingency of language) has been discredited, but by none other than Steven Pinker in his "The Language Instinct" which, as per the above, is at the very least a controversial piece of writing. This is an extremely important point, since it's utterly central to the credibility of the anti-relativist cause, and if one takes Geoffrey Sampson's book (cited above) at face value the nativist claims themselves are built on very suspect reasoning and scientific research. It seems to me (and to writers like Richard Rorty) that language must radically condition our view of the world, because that's the only basis on which we can even describe it.  At the end of the day, properly stated cognitive relativism is no a threat to modern scientific discourse, except that it relegates the scientist from "truth knower" or "person through whom you may have exclusive access to the truth" (sounds a bit like a grand high pooh-bah or - dare I say it - high priest, doesn't it?) to "person whose theory works the best for now" and who may be in competition for that status with other people in the community whether or not they're scientists.   If science *does* work better than feng shui or healing crystals (and I, for one, think it does) then this shouldn't be a particularly troubling way of looking at the world for a scientist who is at ease with his views and his value to the community. So it makes the knee-jerk reactions against relativism, from the likes of Sokal and elsewhere Richard Dawkins, all the more mystifying.  Olly Buxton 
 This is the dumbest, most predictable, horrible waste of time i've ever ever seen.  This movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply wasn't.  It took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that's supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe, drink, and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us.  After watching this movie I felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash.  my only hope is that our european friends didn't seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident 
 i had never heard of anne tyler before i started seeing this book's  hardcover edition all over town. four years later i saw the book again at my local library and decided to pick it up (the demure nape had always intruiged me). what a mistake. i found it redundant, to the point where at certain spots, after i had set the book down, i was positive i had picked it up 10, 15, 40 pages earlier at a passage i'd already read. i soon realized, indeed, i was on the correct page, it was just that a nearly-identical scene was again playing itself out on the page.   how many times does the reader have to experience Rebecca's regret, nasty step (and full) daughters, her doddering senior citizen charge or squeemishness at the touch of her once-true-love? it was the same disappointing non-event over and over.   and i thought this book was also a shameful depiction of one woman's sorry, horrible life. it felt as though she was a mute doormat. i suppose it could be considered a "real" story but Rebecca's lot in life seems to be romanticised. it's not romantic or wistful or nostalgic, it's just sad. 
 Does he BELIEVE he was hired for TV because of his GOOD TASTE?  Or just to laugh at in humiliation of him and his "fashion victims"?  Obviously Carson is someone raised by wolves, but I do "Lupa" and the boys an injustice by failing to note their superiority.  Just look at the dork!  Wearing old lady slippers, and NO SOCKS!  His advice is all on the cover, and looking at it to see what NOT to do is all that's necessary to receive full benefit of the book 
 This story should have and COULD HAVE been really good. It presents a great concept, but the story is just so poorly crafted. It is VERY sexist, the prose is stiff, and the plot is dull. I will concede that it was interesting at times; it kept me reading, but I really didn't get much out of it. I can only praise Heinlein for including the "intelligent conversation" which takes place after the press conference, where there is a great explantion on why the English language is so difficult to learn. The whole story is just very odd. Do read it though. It's a title to read if you wish to be considered "well read." Despite its faults, Valentine Michael Smith will be a character in literature that will never be forgotten, just as we will never forget Atticus from "To Kill A Mockingbird." 
 Like W.D. I felt that the novel was lengthy with characters that simply cluttered the landscape. Tragedy after tragedy unfolds: a kidnapping of an ellitist; a run on a bank; a near-stock market crash; Hong Kong's world-famous floating restaurant catches fire, burns, and sinks; a mud-slide that destroys a prominent hotel; a chinese-communist espionage plot; a soviet espionage plot; secret-agents, double-agents, triple agents (do I need to go on)! All of this occurring within ten days, but the reader loses sense of the time since the book is so time consuming. I was fascinated with Clavell's Taipan and was further interested in the exploits of the Struan family. This was a disppointment! Dunross, the present Taipan, moves through novel with a killer business instinct and brief instances of compassion and humanity. Why does he do it? He is trying to live up to a legacy. That's it. In one sentence that is as deep as Dunross goes. The novel Taipan was so different in development of its characters. Dunross'one-sentence purpose for living, when contrasted with Dirk Struan's vision of the Noble House helping China become a world power was completely lacking. Clavell's earlier work was very insightful about China especially in its potential influence. However, the parade of characters in Noble House is similar to a chinese all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant: plenty of food, but lacking in authentic taste. Overall the work was very tiring and uninspiring. Nothing noble about it at all.   
 This book uses a canon to kill a flea.  Sympathetic as I am to the rhetorical and discursive analysis of cultural formations, such a project requires depth and context to be intelligible:  this book lacks both.  It provides quick parachute drops into various aspects of discursively mediated marketeering strategies touching on discourse touching on the body, and then hurries on to another example or arena without working through the consequences of the argument.  Morever, the style is ponderous enough to kill a child with lead poisoning.  Since the author never bothers to ask who reads (let alone who is persuaded by) the discursive constructs that she so rapidly catalogues, one wonders why she has devoted all this energy to debunking notions that are probably believed by virtually no one 
 The book is not well written.  The author does not clearly explain her thinking, she hops from topic to topic without connecting the ideas behind the topics, and always assumes that the reader has some working knowledge on the matter she is writing about.  That is not to say that the book cannot be useful.  The author has some good points on why technical analysis can work, but it is a petty that more often than not her message does not come across. 
 Oh man, where should I start. First off, thank GOD for iTunes - was able to listen before buying. ALWAYS a good idea, especially if you don't have Windows and their little sample listen-list doesn't work for you.  No, I am  not a Top-40, rap-loving 20 something. In my late 30s. I like electronic and moody music as much as the next person. I have a fab selection, actually - Zero 7, Ivy, Mr. Oizo (Flat Beat), even Enya (sparingly), Portishead, Lisa Hall, Rasputina, K's Choice, Cibo Matto, The Sundays, The Beach soundtrack (WORTH it, especially Faithless), Cruel Intentions soundtrack, even Pump Up the Volume soundtrack. Etc., etc. But this stuff was very boring and average or just plain yuck. NOT worth it. 10 out of the 14 songs I ACTIVELY didn't like. Pseudo-moody, grating, cheesy 'Lite-Rock', music. I will say of the artists on this CD, Pj Harvey is my fave - but this song was a waste of her talents, imo. And is Plumb like a religious singer, or 'inspirational'? Even DJ Muggs was uninspired. And don't even get me started on that twit Nelly Furtado. Really glad I listened for myself and didn't believe all these reviews. No offense guys, but if I could give this one less than one star I would.  Verdict: Cross the street to avoid this CD. It'll be worth the walk 
 I'm a novelist, and this book did not live up to my expectations. Most of the book was written for non-fiction writers.  I've read other query letter guides, which advise authors to  - avoid using opinion to describe your own work (such as 'fast-paced') - avoid using adjectives and adverbs to describe the story  And Mr. Wood agrees. In the short section on novel queries, he includes three examples of query letters that got the attention of their new agents or publishers. Two of them broke these rules.   Mr. Wood proposes that we write a query such that editors and agents sit up and take notice, yet he does not explain how to do this without breaking the 'commandments.' So, if he agrees with the rules, but includes examples of query letters that break them, what's an author supposed to think? My conclusion is that Mr. Wood has no better idea than I do what constitutes a good query letter.  I'll continue my search for a good book on writing query letters. This is not it 
 There is a brand new version of March of the Wooden Soldiers just released for Christmas 2006.  It is from Legend Films and Genius Products and it looks SPECTACULAR.  They have a gorgeous black-and-white version, a stunning new color version (done with a fancy new technology), and tons of really fun bonus material.  I viewed the Legend version (in the red box) alongside the Goodtimes version, and the Legend version is many times better in quality in both b/w and color.  Well worth the extra few dollars and a must buy for Christmas or any other time of the year 
      "The best work of fiction to come out of the Vietnam War"?  "This is the way it was"?  Due to the tremendous reviews, I sought long and hard for this book.  I was truly disappointed.  I found the book hard to read and had to force  myself to finish the book. Fortunately, the latter part of the book dealing with the return home was more captivating.  There are many, many more worthwhile works of fiction on the Vietnam War.  I would not recommend this one.  Try James Webb's "Fields of Fire".  I also liked his post-war fiction "Lost Soldiers" 
 Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45 
 Warning to all those who are reading this for a school assignment: you may think that an "enriched classic" is simply the text with commentary also included. Not so, with this book. They shouldn't call it an "enriched classic". They should call it "dumbed down for lazy readers. 
 My brother picked up this cd used for a few dollars at the local record store because it looked interesting.  Wow, we couldn't keep a straight face throughout this album, it's so amazingly terrible, we just laughed through every song.  I don't want to offend any of our friends overseas, but wow, this guy doesn't even rap!  he just talks with his deep accent over boring beats, I honestly tried to give this album a fair chance, and it hurt my ears.  I mean, have you ever heard something just so awful (like Men Without Hats) that it's funny?  That's the vibe this album gives me.  I have no idea why this guy is successful, maybe there is subliminal messages in the music brainwashing people to like it, but then again, people LOVED the Macarena at one point, so it doesn't surprise me.  Anywho, I'm gonna go ahead and end this review, to the serious hip hop fan, avoid this album like the plague, get a restraining order if you have to.  For people that are charmed and fascinated with English accents and bad music, this cd is right up your alley.  The Zappe 
 ...unless you want to have trouble focusing, have difficulty using them indoors at a sporting event, or have the neck strap bracket break off, etc. I wear glasses and these never did focus well for me. I was not happy when the bracket broke off the day I received them, just as I was to leave for an Africa safari vacation. The biocs kept slipping off my neck the whole trip, and it was frustrating.   Even more frustrating was trying to get them repaired. Suposedly there is a warranty on these. Hah! When I sent them to Bushnell for repair, they wanted [...] 
 This book flows along nicely but never actually goes anywhere. The book simply ends with no action, and no questions answered. It left me very very annoyed 
 I have heard a lot about Richard Matheson, and when I found out he'd written a survivalist fiction story (a favorite sub-genre of mine)I was elated to read it.  However, after a long arduous struggle to continue reading, I realized that disappointment and madness are quite connected.  "Hunted Past Reason" tells the story of two men: Doug and Bob.  Bob, a writer, wants to write a novel of backpacking.  Doug, the expert, is more than happy to teach him the tricks of the trade.  Right from the start, we are privy to the personality clash between the two.  Doug starts out as a "know it all" to Bob.  He tries to bludgeon Bob with his vast knowledge of the wilderness.   As the story progresses, we see Doug's jealousy of Bob's successful career and family life come to the surface.  I must admit that the subtle changes in Doug are blended very well into the story.  On the other hand, the story was dragged out far too long than necessary.  After philosophical discussions between the two (which are strained at best), we see Doug's deep seated sociopathic tendencies which erupt into a game of cat and mouse between the two.  After a graphic rape scene, Doug gives Bob a three hour head start and thus the story turns into "Deliverance" (as quite a few readers in this very forum have pointed out).  The writing seems to be quite repetitive.  The mental conversations between Bob and his subconscious provide for filler and are thinly veiled attempts at drawing the suspense out.  Being a fan of this type of subgenre of fiction, I was mildly entertained by the reading, however, I expected a bit more from Matheson (simply because of his fame and influence he's had on other writers ).  Maybe I was a bit unfair, but the other reviews tell me otherwise 
 There is nothing wrong with the form of this documentary: It is well presented with great CGIs, narration and overall structure - hence it is worth at least two stars (whatever this stars rating business means).  The problem is the substance: it is simply not there. Menzies is one of those pseudo-scientists (as he is indirectly described by one of his opponents) that are in love with their own baseless theory and are not prepared to question its validity regardless of the absence of evidence corroborating it or the presence of evidence contradicting it.  I think a true scientist should not be emotionally attached to any theory and should simply be involved with the process of discovering evidence. Menzies, starts off with his conclusion (rather than ending with it) and fumbles his way backwards trying to find evidence to support it. When all alleged evidence is demolished, he arrogantly states that he will not budge, "one millimetre" as he puts it, from his theory and that, in time, everyone will accept it as a fact that the Chinese were the first to discover America.  A true scientist, even in the presence of evidence substantiating his/her viewpoint, always keeps an open mind and is prepared to accept the eventuality that they may be proved wrong in the future. Menzies does exactly the opposite: with no evidence on his side, he refuses to admit even for a second that he just may be wrong.  It saddens me that by simply engaging in what is nothing short of unsubstantiated verbal diarrhoea, Menzies - not a scientist but, at best, a qualified mariner - managed to make a buck on his book and that PBS, helped him earn some more on the back of his childish theory by making a documentary on him. The feeling one gets at the end, is that PBS ran out of ideas for their next production and decided to make a meal out of this chap's air-ology.  Whilst visually pleasing, this PBS production is in substance a waste of time to watch, as it is neither educating nor troubling the mind of the viewer 
 The step routine is very hard on your knees.  I do a lot of exercises and do not have a problem with knee pain, but this one is really bad.  This company is very unethical.  If you buy direct from them, they sign you up for an online membership that they don't even tell you you signed up for.  They then refuse to credit you for it.    If you order a sample of their whey protein, they send you a whole box and tell you the samples are in the box and if you don't want to pay for it, you can mail it back to them.  What a bunch of crooks. 
 Rather than being a well organized explanation of what Christianity is and of what Christians believe, this book is a rationalization of Christian faith that anyone with even rudimentary critical reading skills can dissect. The increasingly stupid analogies and pop-culture references combine to make the condescension unbearable. This book truly is for dummies 
 i was origionally turned on to this book after hearing about it on VH1. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed upon reading it. She just sounds like an annoying "boy crazy" teen. I somewhat expected that, and it would have been managable if there was any substance or real "juice" to the anecdotes 
 I wasn't sure if I was reading a new novel, or just re-reading one of several of the last Catherine Coulter novels I've waded through.  I think that I am truly sick of the big, strong man caring for sick, injured woman bit.  The story was dumb; there was no real mystery.  I love the "Song" series and most of the Sherbrooke Brides series.  This was plain disappointing 
 It is not so much that I did not think the plot plausable, but the characterizations are untrue to the original book.  I feel not enough time and care was taken to move the plot within the parameters of the characters as set by JA.  Miss Darcy, although entertaining, becomes a pale shade of Elizabeth Bennett.  Lady Catherine becomes flaccidly comic (has she become a vicar or even transposed with Mr Collins?)  It pains me also to see the most interesting and engaging characters of Elizabeth and Darcy pushed so far into the background.  I also take issue with the use of Lizzy and Fitzwilliam as the familiar names the couple uses when refering to each other.  I am almost certain that Elizabeth would always be Elizabeth in Darcy's eyes and that none of the characters in P&P would have used anything but Darcy's surname.  All of this censure aside, it was a good attempt.  I thought the phrasing and meter of the work to pay homage to Austen.  I also admire the care taken in research of the subject matter and time period.  I would recommend this book as what it is aptly titled ":An Entertainment" 
 New Rule:  Stop confusing cruelty with honesty.  -Bill Maher thinks it's his job to tell people the "ugly" truth. But truth that doesn't help make things better is really cruelty gift-wrapped.  Telling people their religions are bogus is not helpful. He says we don't need a savior or a religion or a God, but everyday people are on their hands and knees begging for one. I guess if I had been born a white man in America and never faced any hardships or heartaches, I wouldn't need God either. Furthermore, everybody has religion. It's just that all of our religions aren't in churches. Some people's religions are drugs or sex or pain or alcohol or anything else that we use to help fill that void in our hearts. What's YOUR religion?  It's also funny how Bill Maher ISN'T a Democrat, yet most of his fans are. Hmmm, ever heard the saying, you are what you attract? Libertarianism is only liberalism by a different name. Compare the two and find they agree 95% of the time.  The bottom line is Bill Maher is an arrogant man who thinks he's right about everything and that the majority of America is stupid. Well if America is so stupid, why should we have a democratic system where the stupid have influence? Why not have an oligarchy where only Cornell graduates make the decisions? Better yet, why don't we have a dictatorship with Maher as our leader considering he's the only one with any real intelligence.  He's an immoral man who thinks he's moral because he confuses it with ethics. Ethics is how fairly you treat people. Morality is Godly obedience. Morality says it's wrong to be a pros-ti-tute because our bodies are sacred. Ethics says it's wrong for a pros-ti-tute to t-i-e her John to the b-e-d then steal his wallet. 
 This is pitiful. How do you maximize profit? Easy, minimize quality on every level and capitalize on the brand name. In other words, raise expectations through the roof with a superior detective series and use this momentum to sell an inferior follow-up series under the same name.   Ghost in the Shell 2nd Gig says "Cheap" from the opening credit montage to the bare bone ending credits. The colors, unlike the first season's which were deep and juicy, are dry and monochromatic at times. The inventive little things that embellished the high-tech philosophy and look of the first series are completely lost on this one which seems less specific and more abstract. Even the presentation shouts "economy". The first season's packaging included a booklet, this one, nothing. Oh, I forgot to add that the art for both boxes look thrown together. And let's not forget the animation. There are a lot of clever things being verbalized but by it being called "animation" I don't expect to sit through ten minutes of dialogue to see something, anything move. Another clever little trick to save money.   The look of the characters, from Batou to Kusanagi have been altered considerably. Kusanagi's eyes are bigger and her body seems shorter and less voluptuous. Batou's arms are shorter. The lean, chiseled features of Aramaki which made him appear old and wise are now younger and fuller. The mecha and weapons in this series are also vague. The individual eleven are not as interesting as the laughing man plot of the first season's series.   I had high hopes for this series. There was a lot of thought and creativity behind the first season of GITS. It was better, in my opinion, than Samurai Champloo (though not as popular). I still believe that as this current storyline spins out that it will be better than most of the series out there. Unfortunately, this one will not even come close to the first season and this will probably be the last season for this franchise. Too bad.     
 I would not go so far as to say this movie is terrible. I would say it is self-important, immature, obvious, and overwhelmingly one-sided.  It seems Spike Lee does not believe there are any white people alive who are not either stupid, racist, phony, or downright evil.  I had a bad feeling about this movie as it started off with 4 1/2 minutes of a sleazy looking woman having a seizure accompanied by bad music. Then 4 minutes of an inane morning dj spouting a string of unconnected meaningless words.  Lee had his moments, but it was pretty much a 2-hour music video. Spike Lee doesn't mess with fantasy, only with reality and his reality is black and white. It is infact fantasy, and pure propaganda 
 McLaren's critique of the church in the modern age paints a scathing picture, but doesn't refer to any leaders by name. His perspective seems distorted to me, but I cannot tell who he has in mind, because he doesn't cite any particular modern church writings.    Of most concern to me is that McLaren's strategies seem to lack biblical support.  Culture seems to be the guiding force behind his strategies, but he is working from his own projection of the direction of western culture in the future.  If McLaren's projection is off, then his strategies will be irrelevant at best.  
 I had heard about the earlier version(s) of this book as 'a definitive text' on Software Engineering.  Never got a chance to read those versions.  I can only hope that the earlier versions were somewhat better than this.  1. The text is verbose, difficult to read, doesn't help the reader to connect with the thought process of the author.  Given the nature of the subject, dry and rather difficult, it is the responsibility of the author to make it easy to read, especially when the author is a respected member of the software engineering community. The author has failed to shoulder the responsibility.  2. Many a times the text is outdated.  As an example, the whole chapter on Quality Management gives references to text published in 1981 and 1986. The author then claims, "Although these data are well over 20 years old, they remain applicable in a modern context" ... So absurd !!! Does the author mean that the Software Engineering discipline has failed to such an extent that the software industry (in general) is as bad as it was 20 years ago.    3. The organization of the book is pretty bad.  There are too many quotes, WebRefs, KeyPoints.  Some of the quotes are good, but many a times out of context. And when I think of it, one can publish "Quote of the day" kind of a column for more than a year using this book! (not a bad reason to buy a book ... unintented consequences ... it's like a defect in the software which is declared as a feature)   4. And finally, there is neither anything new nor anything original in this book.    The best advice I could find in this book was more applicable to the author than anybody else. And the advice is in the form of a quote at the end of the section 26.1.4. "It takes less time to do a thing right than to explain why you did it wrong   - H.W.Longfellow"     Dear Author, the readers deserve an explanation! 
 This is the first movie review I have ever written.  I wish I could have been doing something more pleasurable than watching this epic...like poking myself in the eye with an ice pick or lighting myself on fire.  Wait, it gets worse...I actually bought this piece of camel dung..  ..  I am going to loan it to a prick at work that I hate!  No, I'll give it to him and refuse to take it back...  Hurry, go see it! 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 I guess i'm to dumb to purchase an item like this.  I followed the instructions to the letter and it's not working. I guess I should have read the small print.  Sent an e-mail to Xitel for help and waiting for response. Will re-rate later.   
 What happens if the kids start from the last question and works backwards? Anyone knows how to get in touch with the authors 
 If you are looking for an IPod alarm system this is your machine.  The reviewer comments about good sound quality are on the mark.  But it has one serious design flaw at least for how I wanted to use it and I'm returning mine.  I thought it was a dual IPod/Radio alarm system, as advertised.  It is not.  The radio alarm is only a second alarm, apparently for a second sleeper.  You cannot select between the two options. Tried the work around of setting the second alarm to go off first but you can't not set Ipod alarm so when it (or the buzzer) goes off it shuts down the radio.  Can't understand why they couldn't have worked around this issue but beware if you want choice and flexibility in what you wake to.  
 Downloading objects from fan sites can be hit or miss -- I have had many collections I've downloaded work incorrectly or not work at all in the next expansion pack, and items I really liked were suddenly unavailable.  So, I was looking forward to a "Stuff" pack from Maxis.  Bah.  Yes, there are several very nice items, but really, this is an underwhelming collection on the whole.  Items are very limited and the collections are small.  The pictures you see on the cover are a good portion of what is contained.  Like so many here remarked, the money spent is not equal to the value received.  Another reviewer pointed out what the title "Glamour Life" implies -- jewelry, house items, luxurious textures for floors and walls, and clothing for all ages, and most of all, excess and abundance.  There's no abundance here.  I've found items I like, but I am not impressed with the collection.  Maxis knows that its target audience is always hungry for new items, and I think it is taking advantage of the fact, fooling us into thinking we are getting much more than we actually recieve for our money.  I feel a little cheated.  If you must have this, wait until the price drops, or -- better yet -- find a good, reputable fan site  (there are some very good ones out there that have safe downloads) and download for a small fee or for free 
 After moving to CA from CO, and having used Colorado 14er guidebooks by Dawson and Roach, I was disappointed by this book. While there are many fine photographs, wonderful climbing history of the peaks, a slew of routes, and many routes superimposed on photographs, there were many elements that I find essential, that were missing. Topographic maps of the areas in question (with routes drawn on them), round trip distance information, elevation gain, and an estimated (conservative) completion time are essential pieces of information when planning a trip, and are not included here. While the difficulties of the various routes are described well, these other descriptors would make the book twice as good as it is now. Dawson's format, at the beginning of each route description, listing the aforementioned deficiencies (with the exception of the maps) is excellent. From the guidebooks I've looked at though, this is the best available 
 This was disappointing.  Someone should define light roast or standardize the roasting process. 
 Vandana Shiva writes on a worthwhile topic, namely the fact that the dominant economic and legal systems are totally unequipped to deal with environmental reality and have a wildly destructive tendency to impose themselves on the rest of the world. However, this book is sadly too incoherent and poorly written to properly convey the immediacy of this issue. Her arguments are totally lacking in structure and are prone to rediculous, hyperbolic rants about the colonization of the womb and other paranoid fantasies. She cites plenty of sound evidence throughout, but in an equally haphazard fashion. All in all, I guess it is worthwhile to read this book simply because there aren't really any others on the subject, but don't let the fact that Shiva writes like one of those borderline schizo activists turn you off to the importance of the issue of biopiracy 
 I just can't believe people buy his! It's like my little brother and his friends screaming in front of the PC microphone with the original songs as background music. They're just killing the artists. Green Day, U2, Avril Lavigne, Franz Ferdinand, Kelly Clarkson....there's no way I would ever enev consider about buying this thing.  Are you people really gonna tell me that these kids can sing? I bet they're just a bunch of kids whose parents aren't working and they need money for food!!  Please don't even try the music sampler, or your ears could suffer pretty serious damage, I mean it, that's what's happening to me now!! 
 I don't really care whether the book is "true" or not--although I doubt it is.  But despite a few well written sentences here and there, the stories are boring, the characters unsympathetic, and the setting mundane.  I'm not sure what all the hubbub is about.  There are tons of better books out there.  I don't recommend this one 
 The author cannot seem to grasp that there is much discontent amongst the people. She swallows the Islamic doublespeak about women's rights but I'm sure she wouldn't tolerate one tenth of what Iranian women must endure. Also she is fixated on being a blonde in Iran. Weird 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 [Review of original score not of the period pieces]  Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, and Band of Brothers contain some of the best, dramatic scoring for a war film.  Flags of our Fathers does NOT join that rank. There is no memorable music from Eastwood's too simplistic score.  It sounds nice on the trailer but on film, well, all you remember is the same melody played over and over then back and forth among the ensemble.  The weak trumpet piece is nice but gets trying after the two hours of film.  There's little score in the film and on the album hence the era filler music.    The score does support some parts of the film but it falls short during the flag rising.  That should have contained music that would make one's arm hair rise.  Didn't happen.  On album, the music is a tired listen.  Three stars for effort.  One star for boring original score.  Sorry, Eastwood.  Next time outsource your music to someone that specializes in that area of the filmmaking process 
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 Whole book rings false. Like dining at the Olive Garden and hearing cheesy Dean Martin songs played out of the speakers. Or going to lunch at a Japanese restaurant where the diners are tourists and the only Japanese people there are the ones that come just to see where the tourists eat. Dialogue seems one sided like she's talking with herself even though it's supposed to be with other people. Plot seems, for lack of a better word, pretty whack 
 Heavyweights was a quite a disappointment, considering the presence of Ben Stiller. The movie sheds light on a popular summer camp for fat children that unexpectedly finds itself under different management.  The new administration will make it clear very soon that some major changes are to take place...   The plot and the acting are surprisingly (!) average, while the humor and the dialogues are below average.   Ben Stiller's character, a cross between Zoolander and Dodgeball (both being AMAZING movies), was unexpectedly plain and bland. As for the rest of the cast, this film does not seem to be their thing.   Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. 
 I was anticipating a wonderful diary of an amazing journey by an Englishwoman of privilege over the Western Plains of the American West--what I got was a narrative history of the Mormon religion and its ups and downs.  Having read many diaries of Pioneer women, this one attracted me because Jean Rio started out in England with a small fortune at her disposal.  I was disappointed that so much of the book was wasted on Brigham Young and so little of it on Jean.  
 In the end I was disappointed.  Throughout the book two separate stories take place. One is a record of Bob Dubois, whose life is ruled by circumstances and bad life management skills. The other tells of Vanise Dorsinville, a young Haitian woman, who struggles to survive as she makes her way to America. Neither is a pretty story, and when the two characters finally meet it gets even worse. When I finished reading this book I was angry at myself for muddling through all the italicized Haitian accent dialogue and French Creole voodoo terminology.  Yah mon, true 
 This is one of the most offensive and anti-gay movies I have ever seen.  Don't let the title or the box fool you.  Every character in this movie is oozing with homophobic sentiment.  I was shocked that such a film could come out of France.  If you're a homophobe and want to sit and watch a bunch of hateful people sit around and attack and harass (verbally and physically) a man who pretends to be gay to save his job, then rent this and snack on a can of worms.  HIDEOUS 
 Love the topic and a lot of what Schmitt has to say, but have significant issues with the style, language and presentation.  The book's style is neither fish-nor-fowl, but occupies a middle ground between science fiction, an academic paper and a powerpoint presentation.  It largely reads like an academic paper, with countless footnotes (oddly placed at the end of each chapter, not at the end of the book) and a writing style that's hard to folow unless you are willing to find a pen & paper to take notes while you read.   In this sense it resembles the guise of a very dry academic paper - which would be fine, but at the same time it also lacks the focus and precision of an academic paper.   Previous comments have focused on some of the perceived inacuracies in  across some the many specialized fields he touches, including: - fussion reactors,  - mining technologies  - exogeology,  - economics,  - long-term energy predictions,  - spaceflight,  - management theory, - International relations - etc..  He certainly deserves praise for the amount of time and effort he has spent becoming conversant in all those diverse disciplines, but his presentation of each individual one is typically dry and often unequal to the complexity of the subject matter.  Finally, my primary issue with his approach is that it's based on a strange & uneasy mixture of private enterprise and Apollo-style government science projects.    Substitute taxpayers for investors, and you have much the same approach - various people representing multiple constituencies gathered around a conference table, a strategic plan, and a massive pool of cash to be deployed in pursuit of this plan.   It just doesnt work that way - no large company started life *as* a large company, and certainly not as a large company with a plan.   If/when we do see He-3 mining on the moon, it will come about as an organic process, with carpetbaggers, prospectors, conflicting claims, unrelated developments, lawsuits, booms and busts, lucky breaks, etc.. 
      I read previous reviews about not being able to run the program because the computer recognized it as a copied disk. I thought this couldn't possibly happen on my high tech computer... I WAS WRONG... Even though I purchased a legitamate copy, the program still would not let me run it.... BUYER BEWARE!!!!! 
 I would love to own this soundtrack but why anyone would pay 120 bucks is just plain dumb.  Quite frankly I would like to see your copyright on this item to see if you are just Reburning these CD's and reselling them.  For 120 bucks you should be reported to the authorite 
 If I hadn't already read the book I would not have been able to figure out what was happening, because the abridgement hacked up the story so badly. The reader is a different person than the male/female team who did the first five books, and he pronounced everything so differently (names, places, foreign words and phrases) that I couldn't recognize the characters. In addition, his mis-phrasings had a tendency to alter the meaning of conversations he was reading. It was like he did not rehearse it at all. I only got this because there was no unabridged version available, and it was a waste of time and money to get this abridged version 
 I ordered my subscription 3 months ago and still have not received it.  
 He's done,he fell off just like Master P,No Limit,Ruff Ryders all them,murder Inc.His first 2 albums were good,between 1999-2002 was Pastor Troys glory years and when he had the juice.All You sucka Ass N*ggaz get over it 
 The author Edward Stone did nothing for this book but interview a bunch of different financial consultants then write this book. Shouldn't an author of a book know what he is writing about? Find a book written by a financial consultant. The writing style was incredibly boring and I had a hard time finishing this book. This book did very little to educate me on getting ready to be a financial consultant 
 The cover that I received was much shorter than pictured.  Someone else had the same problem.  I sent it back, it seemed pointless.  I am using my old Weber cover.  It doesn't look real pretty, but it provides outdoor protection - which IS the point 
 My daughter and I have played all of the previous games; we've enjoyed them overall.  Some of the games are fantastic, challenging and fun. This game was quite lame in comparison to the others.  The puzzles weren't really puzzling, just boring tasks.  There were not many clues to find.  Because there weren't many clues, there was no real sense of detecting anything.  The game ended abruptly and was very short.  We did NOT use a walk-through to solve the mystery in record time, just experienced a lack of challenge.  We did like the newness of becoming Frank and Joe Hardy occasionally.  The rest was pretty boring.  If you are looking for a Nancy Drew game, try one of the others instead 
 I would strongly advise against purchasing this item.  I just bought one and spent nearly five hours trying to get it working.  That includes 1.5 hours on the phone with a Linksys representative.  When he said I had to reformat my hard drive, I terminated that conversation.  Then I tried email support.  After following two or three links they sent me, which essentially had me repeat what I had done over the phone, I gave up.  Then I got a call from Linksys and spent another 45 minutes with a representative.  In the end he said he couldn't make it work on my computer and I should return the item.  I have used this same computer with a "generic" USB wifi stick for over a year.  After the representative gave up, I borrowed a D-Link wifi and installed it without any problem.   
 John Irving remains one of my most favorite and respected authors, in spite of, not because of this book.  After reading Garp, Cider House, and a few others, perhaps it is my own lofty expectations for consistent greatness that led to my genuine disengagement with this particular text.   Many of the classic `Irving' traits (sub-plots, interior dialogue, overt sexuality) encompassed the novel but the most important aspect was missing.  Even at the conclusion of the story I could not make myself care for or truly understand Dr. Daruwalla (protagonist).  After 700-something odd pages, (usually an aspect of Irving's style that I appreciate and embrace), I was ready for the novel to end.  And it did, rather expectedly and unceremoniously.  This is not to say that the novel should not be read, it was mildly enjoyable (perhaps because I read the majority of it on the beach), but as for John Irving's potential, it pales in comparison to `his greats'.  Hesitantly recommended for the veteran Irving reader is the best rating I can give this book.  
 There were problems with this outdoor fireplace right from the start. First,CharBroil failed to include the hardware for the fireplace to be assembled. It must be a common occurence because in huge letters, on the 2nd page of the manual, is the question "ARE YOU MISSING PARTS?"  Then, CharBroil did not make it easy to just get the packet of nuts and bolts. After calling the number that was provided, I was told proof of payment for the specific model had to be sent in first. After sending the required info, the missing hardware arrived in about two weeks.  Once assembled, it worked fine but it rusted some over just one summer's use and had to be touched up with heat resistant spray paint. The side screen doors flap in the wind because there is nothing to secure them in place. The rating of one star is because this just is not a quality product and CharBroil made me jump through the proof of payment hoop just to get the missing screws. 
 I am not a doctor or nutritionist, but nutrition is a subject that interests me. If I, as a layperson, were to write a book about this subject I would dive into the internet and read a bunch of articles and come up with probably similar conclusions as this author. Unfortunately, the science and the studies of nutrition is not that simple to interpret. The majority of nutritional studies are flawed and unless you are an expert in the field you cannot easily determine the accuracy of the study  or the conclusions that are made. Reading articles about studies, rather than the studies themself is probably the worst thing to base a conclusion off of and write a book about, which the author(and most authors) seems to do here, based on his opinionated writing and nonscientific conclusions. Some of the information in this book is correct and some is not. The other problem I have is that the author doesn't seem to have any experience with patients of any of the topics he writes about. For instance, he really slams flouride, most of which I agree with. But many dentists and people I have talked to claim that fluoride really does work for the teeth. Maybe injesting it is unnecessary, but rubbing it on the teeth seems to be good. He also says fish oil supplements and some vitamin supplements are beneficial. That is not accurate either. Most oil supplements are sold in a rancid state because they are not refrigerated and 99.99% of vitamins are just chemicals which offer no improvement in health or prevention of disease. He also says cholesterol has nothing to do with getting heart disease (I'm paraphrasing). Most cardiologist would agree that cholesterol does not cause heart disease, but numerous studies show a direct correlation between high cholesterol and heart disease. As my cardiologist put it "The inflammation is the fire, the cholesterol is the fuel." Those are just a few of the many inaccuracies. The real unfortunate thing about this book is that it does not help you "find reality in the mire of food industry propoganda" as the title claims. It leaves you more confused. Even his conclusion is that he doesn't really know what the best diet is and that everybody is different and should have different diets. Uh, ok, thanks for nothing. I would recommend to anyone interested in nutrition to read "Eat to Live" by Dr. Joel Fuhrman. He seems to be a more credible expert on nutrition and has much experience with patience to back up his conclusions. If you want a good book regarding politics and nutrition, check out "The China Study". 
 This was a waste of my money. Picked it up at the airport and thought it would be a fun, light read but it was boring and not funny at all. I left it unread in the plane 
 I had my twins at 35 after fertility treatments and still had a difficult time relating to the woman in this book. Not because I like things sugar-coated or pretend that motherhood is always a bed of roses. But for a far better written realistic account of how tough new babies can be on your psyche,read Anne Lamott's Operating Insructions. Judith Newman had a charmed life, with the full time nanny and never bothering to breastfeed even one week,even though the babies were preemies and one had very serious weight gain issues for months.There are some funny lines, but mostly I just found myself disgusted with her and being happy i checked it out from the library instead of buying it 
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 Religion is a sticking point and source of tension for many couples, but if it's not, or if you are not Christian, this book will disappoint.  Chock full of bible verses. Questions such as "Which Sunday School teacher influenced you the most?" and "Are there any limits placed upon the wife's submission by Colossians 3:18 and Acts 5:29?" simply do not apply to everyone 
 Yes, horror fans, I'm afraid to say that the title of this review is a line uttered by one of the characters in this movie.  It wasn't necessarily the actual line that was so bad, but the delivery of that line that is cringe inducing!  That alone is worth viewing this heap of garbage for sheer camp factor.  Too bad you have to wait until near the end of the movie.  Every performance is this movie is either bottom of the barrel (observe the sheriff, his daughter, the black woman) or over the top camp (observe the witch, the whole opening sequence).   This is one of those BAD cheesy horror movies (much like ANY horror movie released in the early 1990s).  The original Pumpkinhead was one of the underrated horror classics of the '80s.  This sequel does nothing more than cash in on that (and I'm not too sure exactly how much "cash" was reaped here).   Soleil Moon Frye (who you may remember as Punky Brewster) is probably the ONLY reason to even be interested in this, and she's even awful here! She looks like an NBC movie-of-the-week Amy Fisher-esque reject and even gets offed by Pumpkinhead in one of the top clique ways you can die in a horror movie! The whole charade is just plain laughable.  The monster itself isn't half bad, but it's nowhere near as authentic as the original.  DUMB, DUMB, DUMB, DUMB 
 The mere act of arguing that comic art qualifies as "fine art" somehow legitimizes such nonproductive and ultimately meaningless distinctions. Yet this catalogue's obvious purpose is to somehow elevate, by force of such argument, the reputations of comic strip and comic book artists. As the early twentieth century cultural critic, Gilbert Seldes, stated in his review of George Herriman's Krazy Kat:  	Krazy Kat, the daily comic strip of George Herriman is, 	to me, the most amusing and fantastic and satisfactory 	work of art produced in America today.  With those who 	hold that a comic strip cannot be a work of art, I shall 	not traffic.   Not only is it unlikely that this book of self-promoting essays, largely written by comic artists, will advance the position of comic art within the insular and rarified world of contemporary art criticism, the book does not even go far enough to promote the appreciation of the genre among those readers/viewers with a genuine interest in the art form.   The presentation of comic strip art is certainly worthy of attention, despite the glaring exclusion of any significant discussion of the two giants of adventure strip art, Alex Raymond and Hal Foster. But the quality of the strip art which is included speaks so loudly that the written commentary can be largely ignored in evaluating the artistic merits.  Ironically, the authors' verbose analyses of modern comic book art will probably fall on more sympathetic ears, despite the fact that  most of the artists chosen as representative of American comic book art would not even be considered by most comic book aficionados as top contenders for inclusion in a comic art exhibition.  But, then again, that is probably why these "graphic novel" and underground comic book artists were selected -- they produce the type of art that is most likely to appeal to the gimmick sensibility of contemporary art critics.  When judged by more traditional (some would say old-fashion) standards of artistic excellence, such as quality of draftsmanship and composition, it is hard to see how most of these artists have produced even good art, let alone "fine art."  But, perhaps like the child who could not see the emperor's new clothes, some viewers just are not sophisticated enough to fully understand or appreciate fine contemporary comic book art.  If you fall into this category, then this is the perfect book for you.  CRAIG W.  ENGLUND 
 Jackson is no Bob Klein, but no beer writer can be.  However, this book is  not bad as long as one doesn't expect too much.  Hardly the authoritative  resource it purports to be and tends to be pretentious 
 The earrings are nice & a great value at $30. However, the posts are too thick for my liking and make my ears sore. The posts are not the typical size one might find in US stores. The posts are more typical of earrings that I have purchased in Central & Southern America; in fact, this is where the earrings were made. I returned them 
 The book starts out slow, and it weaves its way through the past and present, which gets a little annoying.  While it does have some feeling to it, and it does give a good insight to what life for african americans was like back then, I was for the most part dreadfully bored with the book.  Not something I'd really recommend to people to read 
 I have been a loyal Sony product user for over 30 years.  However, their Compact Disc Recorder RCD-W500C/W100 is the most confusing piece of equipment to operate that I have ever seen.  It reminds me of apparently the latest manufacturing thought about anything high tech- incorporate as many bells and whistles as you can to accommodate everyone's tastes.  For instance, why does it need a remote?  How many people will be cutting CDs from their easy chairs?  I have a call in to two friends who I hope can rescue me from my dilemma 
 Nothing in Nazneen's life has ever been under her control.  Even her birth itself was left to fate: she seemed to be stillborn but then she finally took her first breath and fate allowed her to live.  This story was told to her throughout her childhood in Bangladesh, and she learned that it was futile to fight against fate.  When her father announces that she, at eighteen, is to go to London to marry a forty-year-old man named Chanu, Nazneen doesn't argue.  London is lonely.  Nazneen doesn't speak English, is discouraged from making many friends and can't really relate to her husband, a selfish and pompous man who seems to think himself overly kind because he doesn't beat his wife.  She tries being passive and going along with her life.  Then she tries rebelling in small ways but is frustrated when Chanu doesn't seem to notice she's neglected her housekeeping duties.  It is only when Nazneen and Chanu's baby boy is in the hospital that Nazneen begins to appreciate her husband's good qualities and she also experiences some moments of pure happiness.  Throughout the next twenty years or so, though, Nazneen is unable to hold onto that happiness.  It is only when she finds out that her husband finally has taken steps to put into action one of his long-discussed plans that she is spurred to action.  This book, for me, was one long and depressing chore to read.  Nazneen allowed herself to be a slave to her fate, but the entire book was a detailed list of all of the ways in which her life was completely unbearable.  I found it agonizing to read about someone who was so thoroughly unhappy all of the time, and it made me anxious to read about the ways in which Chanu continued to mess up the lives of Nazneen and their children.  The book had an uplifting ending, but it was so abrupt that it seemed unrealistic and jarring, instead of the relief it should have been. 
 Contains scenes of male and female nudity, foul language, drug use, sexual situations. Rated "R".   You may have seen some commercials like this.  Like the film, Waking Life (2001), "A Scanner Darkly" is a motion picture that has been filmed normally like a movie, however afterwards everything in the frame is traced including the actor and computer-colored like a cartoon.  It is not for children, but for adults.   Bob Archer (Keanu Reeves) who is able to wear a suit that creates different human images over him when he is in public, must go undercover and be friends with James (Robert Downey Jr), Freck (Rory Cochrane) and Ernie (Woody Harrelson) to investigate their drug use.   Bob is also under medical examination for Substance D, however he only takes it at stress level at minimal and has sworn off cigarettes.  Working for the New Path is apart of his job, but it wasn't part of his job to become addicted to Substance D.  He has been careful about that and he wants out.   Winona Ryder is also in the cast.   DVD includes Audio Commentary, 2 featurettes, theatrical trailer 
 I'm sorry, but I guess I just don't get it.  Trevor's prodding prose is often beautiful, but the story is a little hard to follow.  This is the stuff that legends are made of?  And whatever happened to character development?  I didn't really care for any the characters nor did I care what happened to them.  And *that's* my standard for judging a book a good read.  Can't really give it a thumbs-up.  
 I was expecting a book.  This is a packet of papers. The activities are shallow and the packet does not contain any activities more than what I could create on my own in a few minutes on the computer.  It focuses on vocabulary and does not include anything creative, motivational, or very little that will even move students to engage in higher-order thinking.  I am incredibly disappointed and will not be using any of the activities in my seventh grade classroom.  
 This book did NOT provide any good information for real business people trying to get money for their business.  Save your money by NOT buying this 
 I have taken yoga classes for years and it is nice to see the medical doctor values such a art to help back pain suffers.This book is okay for someone new to yoga and has back pain but it is over 10 years old. needs to be updated. I recommend other up to date books on the market today that shows the reader all forms of exercies to use to over come back pain 
 The sizes listed do not print on the invoice.  Instead, Army Navy uses 'codes.'  When they send the wrong sizes, then they blame you for not selecting the right size and want a 15% restocking fee plus return shipping 
 Having seen Ann Coulter once it is rather hard to catagorize this book, especially in view of how she acts in person and her "vocabulary" off camera. Since I generally review military books I will try to stick with that topic.   Ann devotes an entire chapter in this book, 206-218, to a rather bizarre comparison: how Max Cleland lost his limbs in Vietnam to Bush's "honorable" service in the National Guard. Yes it is true that Cleland lost his limbs through an accident. This accident rated some rather derisive comments from Bobby Muller, but that does not grant Coulter the right to do the same. I saw Cleland at hearings and he left much to be desired in my opinion, especially regarding veterans issues. I dealt directly with Cleland's office and they really never really cared. And it is true he always played the sainted one during hearings. For Coulter to equate a disabling injury in Vietnam to Fort Dix, as on page 208, shows how demented she is.   What Coulter does in this chapter is denigrate Cleland's service (through an accident) so as to pump up Bush's record in the National Guard. Anybody who served in Vietnam knows what NG service was all about. Coulter tries to lie about Bush not being AWOL, which is a simple fact. Interestingly, she likes to use the Boston Globe to help prove other points in her book, also regarding Cleland (see page 212). Since that is the case, why didn't she use the Globe's excellent and extended investigation, never refuted, which proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Bush was indeed AWOL. And, for the record, just because somebody got an honorable discharge does not mean they never went AWOL. Indeed, my own father went AWOL before WWII, served 30 days, and received an honorable discharge in 1945 as a pilot. The only reason my father served 30 days and Bush did not is because the latter had a congressman for a father.    In Chapter 7 I had to laugh over her comment about "slutty-girls" and this "is not how women talk". Okay, but that is how YOU talk off camera, Ann.   I would like to point to two other unrelated topics. On page 312 Ann makes a ridiculous argument against legalizing drugs. Prohibition was a failure for a number of reasons, not least of which was it created crime and corruption. I don't follow her circular logic at the bottom of the page. I also don't agree with her touting herself as a "conservative success story" on page 321. Her personal life is a mess, but she is a millionaire, and that is how she measures success.   My final comment to people like Ann and her followers is this: if you are so sure a group of Americans or "liberals" are ready to "surrender" to the terrorists, why don't you strap it on and join the fight? I would have more respect for you if you even joined the National Guard as a reporter for the Stars and Stripes, you know, kind of like what Al Gore did in Vietnam. 
 This book is the worst book I have ever read. First I was confused why Basils mother died before he set things right, This was one of the main men I wanted to see set thing right with his mom. It gets worse, The book is very hard to read she jumps around alot from Ben, to other charcters. I had to force myself to read it and trust me my head still hurts. And the book is only 173 pages long. I wish I have never brought it this book goes off into space and I dont know what the  she is talking about. Well trust me dont get this book,if you are looking for a good book to read 
 Buffy and friends become involved with Arianna, a troubled young woman on the cusp of sixteen whose abilities rival those of Buffy herself.  They try to befriend her and discover the truth about her.  Scott Ciencin knows how to write the characters and has a good grasp of the show's vernacular, but he is less successful at crafting a compelling story.  Most annoying, he gives Arianna an ability that would allow her to easily resolve the tension and uncertainty that torments her, yet provides an excuse for not exercising it that is very flimsy and contrived.  The humor leans toward the cute and lacks the bite that characterizes the best writing of the series.  If this is the type of story that had appeared on air, Buffy would not have lasted seven seasons 
 I love Mae West but this book bombed.  It is informative but so much that it's boring.  I never finished it.  It has some great photos and if you're doing a term paper on her it's wonderful 
 I picked one of these up from the Apple store and used it that day. Not only does the product not broadcast well (I had to hold it two feet from my radio, it didn't even get a signal in the car on any frequency) but it dosent stay in the dock connector. The transmitter actually will not lock into the bottom of the iPod. The transmitter also appears to turn off after 5 seconds of not touching the buttons. The LCD screen turns off so you cannot see the frequency it is transmitting on. Because it worked so poorly I couldn't tell if it was broadcasting or if it was simply broken. An indicator saying whether the transmitter was on or off would be helpful and not a huge battery drain.  If you want a knockoff transmitter that works only when placed perfectly next to your radio than get this. If you want something that works consider the iTrip by Griffin 
 Pinsky should do his reseach better less than 1 % of all paitents  prescibed narcotic pain relivers  become even close to being addicted. Pinsky would also know that long term use of NSAIDS cause serious  and fatal effects with in a few weeks . He should  know the difference between addction a social construct and depandancy a biological  action . and psudoaddcition due to the pain reliever not working .    Pinksy's prohibtionist agenda comes through clearly .His  demonizing and distortions of medicince that help millions of  law abiding  people  live fulfilling and  healthy lives depend upon narcotic pain rleivers . To take them away from them is both cruel and  inhumane   . If Pinsky does not like narcotics he does not have to take them . His hyperbole and hystronics only serve to make the lives of those who suffer from long term chronic pain more miserble . 12 step meetings are not going to end or even relieve severe pain. Walk a mile in  a pain suffers shoes before  spouting this  unsceintific and potentially   harmful drivel and   gibberish . I should give this quackery and claptrap a negative rating. Good for  a socilogical  readoing on  the mytology of opiods thopugh.and how to fearmonger.  ther is not an epdemic if even a million people thoughtthe US alone  even try a prescition drug  for  a high . we live in a naton of nearly 300 million  . It shows Pinsky has little real knowledge of opids  and what they really are  if he did he would at least know that  pain Patients do not get "high" from these  medcations  .    Try   real research by   unbiased    reseachers  not 12 step prohibitionists such as Pinsky    Second  parentsand shpould keep thie meds    away from thier children and talk with them about them if they cannot then there is a serious prbl;em in that family ,that is the real problem 
 Seriously , miles davis's music for me , i only can use one word to describe it : boring !! its just my personal taste , like hear some of his record , i cant really feel anything that will touchs me , charlie parker famous for his technique , charles mingles... cools orchestra setting , bill evans... great harmony and chord.  But Miles Davis ?? i just cant found any element that will makes me like him. kind of blue is not bad , but i just dont think its classic. 
 The plot is good but there are about 200 pages too many.  Why a full chapter to tell us what the protagonists are thinking about the attach case, when we already know it was not in the car and we could tell them where it is? We know where the precious document is : another useless quest. People are murdered by the half dozen, the characters are outrageous, most of the time improbable, and I felt the semi-erotic swimming episode totally stupid, not to mention the girl apologizing constantly about it. I have read much better books than that. Sorry.. 
 Creationist A: Boy, am I getting frustrated.  The evolutionists have an incredible amount to evidence that's really hard to refute.  I mean, WE true believers know they're wrong, but to the general public, let's face it, the evolutionist case just looks too good.  They got TONS of science on their side. What can we do?  Creationist B: How about this. Why don't we get someone to write a book that says there are complex biological features that could not evolve because the parts they're made up of couldn't function alone.   CA: But haven't we already tried that dozens of times in various ways?  I mean, the evolutionists have always said that looking at complex end products doesn't tell the full story.  And you gotta admit, that makes sense.  I mean, the whole point they make is that biological features evolve in a slow, step by step process over huge spans of time, one small change at a time. In the meantime, they say, the transitional forms could become extinct, making it seem like a complex form came out of nowhere. Like I said, this is frustrating.  CB: You're missing the point.  I know a guy who's a biochemist.  He can write up something using all the technical jargon.  He can even get into things like genetics and DNA and all that stuff and make it sound really convincing. I mean, it's not gonna fool biologists or biochemists but let's face it, THEY aren't the ones we're trying to fool.  We'll call it "intelligent design" instead of "creationism" .  We'll try to make it sound like it's something new.  People won't know what to think. When they see it on bookstore shelves, a lot of people might just think it's actually a legitimate science book.  What are they gonna do?  Go out and take advanced university courses in biology and chemistry to find out for themselves?  They're gonna think it's real.  CA: I get it. You just want to deliberately create confusion among the general public by writing over their heads, even if you know what you've written is garbage.  CB.  Precisely.  CA: Very sneaky!  I like the way you think.  Let's just hope those people don't bother to look at other sources of information.  They might just find out this ID stuff is baloney.  CB:  Shhh!!!  You'll give it away!! 
 If you saw the original Broadway cast of Fosse perform, you would realize how sad this video really is. If you want to see real Fosse choreography, rent or buy one of his movies. 
 Dont get me wrong, i'm kinda young but i love 80's / 90's movies specially the horror ones.  I had great spectation for early Geoge Romero movies. But both night of the living dead and day of the dead are pretty bad. Gorge Romero is a pionner of the zombie movies and sure a that time they were scarry, but for today standars they are not, even they are not that good for most of the 80's 90's movies.  The Bad:  1. Acting is not beleavible. It looks like the were "acting" 2. The dialog's are not how people actually talk. 3. The soldiers at "Day Of The Dead" are a shame, they are fat stupid and dont have any dicipline. They behave like a bunch of drunken teenages and they are grown ups  4. More than half of the movie you just see them talking and yelling each other. 5. I think is stupid that zombies behave like living humans (listening music, shooting, "talking" ) 6. the only 3 scarry moments are just the tipical fast escenes from a quiet moment. Theres is not any frightening atmosfere .  The Good:  1. The gore scenes are really good, maybe too much bloody. It shows how good in cammera effects are rather than computer generated.   So far the only great zombie movie i have seen, beleive it or not is Resident Evil 1. Resident Evil 1 has it all. Resident Evil 2 NOT. Resident Evil 2 is one those "just shoot and kick" movies and I'm not a fan of cliches or indiscrimanated violence ala rambo.    So if you want a gory movie, maybe you may like this movie, but the gore is just at the end of the movie. You will be better pleased with "Cabin Fever".  If you want a frighten atmosfere and real fear look somewhere else maybe Resident Evil 1, Poltergeist, the original japanese version of The Ring and The Grouch, ScareCrows. Alien, Aliens and even Alien 3 not Alien 4 (It Sucks).  But the Best review is your own so i recomend you rent them and judge them by your own and decide if the worth the price 
 This book read like a textbook...not very interesting or helpful. In fact, I read through it and was so unimpressed that I returned it the day after I received it 
 I think biggie was one of the best in the hip hop world which is why i cant stomach this.The production is amateur throughout,the guest rappers and singers bring nothing to the table and the subject matter is non evident from track 1 to 24.To top it off they have lifted biggies lyrics from his old tracks and then stuck them on this,and then they have the nerve to print a sticker on the front of the cd claiming it has all new tracks.I have never felt so ripped off buying a cd in my life,this is a disgusting insult to a hip hop legend 
 Interesting observations about rehab and kicking a bad drinking problem, so part of the book is worthwhile and inspiring.  About half way through I had to quit.  It was too much like reading the diary of a shallow teenage girl.  (Will he call me?  Did the gorgeous guy wear that tight shirt to impress me?  All I do is think about him.  Is he thinking about me? Oh, please, please, please, let him say something to me.  I love you, but I'm not in love with you.)  On and on. The humor is mildly amusing, but seems forced; it doesn't ring quite true, like the author is trying too hard.  An earlier negative reviewer said they didn't like the author.  It didn't prevent me from reading the book - I like the writing of a number of unlikable people.  But I now understand - the book is completely about this shallow person.  His struggle with alcohol is one of the few interesting/humane things about him.  His colleagues force him into rehab, which turns his life around.  He returns to work a changed and invigorated man, loving life, but continues to mock the people who saved him.  It doesn't dawn on him to thank them.  
 I found any plot disrupted by the author's silly use of the term "mon". I believe he used it to give us an insight into Jamaican culture :=). Sam Tucker's use of the words "Boy" and "Son" are also very amateurish 
 In other book series where the author has died such as the Ian Fleming/James Bond series where Benson or Gardner's name is prominently displayed, or where the author has built such a name for himself such as James Patterson that he can just slap his name on the front cover and it will sell, the one who actually wrote most (or all?), or even some of the book is identified.  In the Tristan Betrayal, no one has claimed credit. And I can see why. But isn't this just plain wrong? Shouldn't the anonymous author own up to his words? For younger people whose only information about the author might be the admittedly good movies The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, isn't The Tristan Betrayal a kind of betrayal? I think so. It's fraud by whomever owns the rights to Robert Ludlum's name.  Even if this book were good, which it isn't for the reasons well-covered by others below, no one should be allowed to perpetrate such a fraud on the public. And it's not fair to Ludlum either 
 This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste. Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money 
 I read this book and I was quite dissapointed. I had read My 60 Memorable games and The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal, and felt that those were excellant books! I felt that Nimzowitsch didn't have anything good to day. I read this book last year, when I was under 1600, and thought to myself, maybe its to advanced I will try reading it again in a year from now.  But now at expert strength I still am going wow, its not good at all.   Fine, Nimzowitsch gave some good ideas about chess, but it seemed all very basic! I think/thought that this books was a total waste of money if you have a USCF rating of over 1300, and a ICC rating of probably over 1500.  If you are under that, this book may benifit you.   Even though it is said that every one read My System, I disagree.  I think that this book is a very sad excuse for a "classic".  I really believe that it is a nothing compared to "The Life and Games of Mikhail Tal" and "My 60 Memorable Games".  I guess overall, the book wasnt so hot, but it may be benificial to people who are lower rated, but people who are higher rated I would highly advise NOT TO BUY THIS BOOK! It would be a waste of money : 
 I really prefer the Shoumei Green Tea which is one of the only green teas I can find that isn't bitter. The white tea doesn't have any sweetness to it and isn't much fun to drink. I only drink it because it's good for me.

 this is the cut down version of the 3 hour pilot that universel released in theaters after the show went belly up in '78. if you buy the whole series you can skip this pointless rehash that isn't that good or very well thought out 
 Many Many sections and tables of the 2005 NEC are missing from this tab set.  If you think you are going to get a full set, you are not.  The printing on the bottom of the set reads:  Construction Book Express 
 My son was given this pool as a birthday gift. It looked like a lot of fun on the picture HOWEVER there are so many pieces to blow up which isn't even the problem..the rainbow and tree never stood up..just kept falling over. the wagon wheels fall off, the green "garden patch" (greeen thing with holes) takes up too mutch room and the clear plastic thing that has velcrow doesn't stand up. This pool doesnt hold very much water at all (came up to my two year olds ankles..not very refreshing on a sunny day) and is such a hassle to clean (you know how it is..kids in and out tracking dirt in) I like a hard pool where you can easily dump the water out and squirt it out. This thing is so bulky ...wouldnt recommend it...my son didnt care for it either. 
 It just astonished me as how certain discursive formations can actually lead people to believe as the 'real' reality. It does not matter whether for an event to 'really happen' or not. What matters is that you hear it on a radio or read it on a newspaper or website or even talk about it at the water-cooler. Those who have had the chance to watch 'Wag the Dog' might get the idea of how such 'reality' is constructed.  On a more advanced level 'discursivity', a la Foucault, is a building block of a discourse in which certain linkages, here and their, add to what ordinary people believe on the street.  Now obviously Hitler was one of the worst things that happened during the 20th century. This is commonsense. But to add certain 'material' so as to advance another claim by building upon Hitler, is something that should be carefully approached, at least for people who at least visit and read stuff through Amazon. If a chain in a series of discursive formations can be shown to be weak or invalid than it would be proven that that chain of a discourse is on shaky grounds, and that most of what is known about it is likely to be false. Unfortunately we see certain 'material' is attached to certain claims so as to resemble the Holocaust. Let us revisit a single claim on part of those would like to exploit the events during the early 20th century. A reviewer, for instance, obviously bought one claim and thus knows it to be the 'truth'  Adolf Hitler: "Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"  Now has anybody bothered to investigate it. No, of course. "It sounds like as if it is true, so why not believe it". Well fortunately there are still people who like investigating such stuff. Read for example : Heath W. Lowry Washington, D.C. Political Communication and Persuasion, Volume 3, Number 2 (1985) Abstract This article traces the history of a purported Adolf Hitler quote which cites the perecent of the world's lack of reaction to the fate of Armenians during the First World War as a justification for his planned extermination of European Jewry in the course of the Second World War. By a detailed examination of the genesis of this quotation the author demonstrates that there is no historical basis for attributing such a statement to Hitler... [...] If one is serious about really getting into history, rather than believing simply what is out their in the popular press, I would additionally suggest to take a tour of the documents of Ambassador Morgenthau. First let us not take any word for having a Godly truth 'Its ambassador so its gotta be true' mentality is ok if you're ok with it (respect of thought). But there are historical evidence that suggests that Morgenthau did not even know Ottoman scripture, and that this is proved throughout his letters when he attempts to translate 'words' and 'dates' of events. Do not hesitate to read... [...]   For those who have CAREFULLY read what I have written so far, notice I am not either on one side of the argument between Armenian historians or historians of the Ottoman empire, but that I have just thrown out some thought provoking information so that one will at least ask some questions before believing what they read. Doubtless there will be those occasional pointless replies to this review, but again all I am saying is, think before you react. Now one could argue that I am saying is a postmodernist crituque and historical relativism. That would be false. I believe in historical analysis, as a scientific enterprise (and only the scientific version of it). But then again let us not forget that some American historians who were studying the case at hand were bombed by Armenians. Now if history is written by historians and that some historians (i.e. UCLA professor Stanford Shaw)are bullied so as not to investigate certain historical matters than, at least if you have a capacity to think critically than be suspicious about it. [...] By the way absolutely nothing is mentioned about the equal ammount of civilian Turks that were slaugthered by Russian backed Armenian militia. Nor anything about the terrorism campaign of Armenians during the 1970's that left thousands of people dead and wounded. To say "denying genocide is a wrong thing" is one thing. But in doing so if one is denying the death of tens of thousands of innocent Turks, is called hypocrism and puts one in ethically shaky grounds.    The latest British governemeents acceptance that the "blue book", which Armenian claims are based upon, have been declared by the government itself to be a WW1 time propaganda material. Yes you heard it right!  Here's another eye opener: Often the claim is made there 1 million Armenians were murdered. What they do not say that the same material they indicate that a "genocide" happened says that  the ENTIRE Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire was 800 thousand (200 thousand difference!) MOREOVER Keep in mind that the Armenian diaspora, that builds its own desire to have a national identity, has a population of more than 9 million people across the world. HOW CAN this be??? Well thats how nationalism is formed: impossibile numbers, man on white horse, the evil "other" etc.... So this "genocide" attitude is more of identity building rather than real history.   Well I hope I contributed on an intellectual level and I hope 'thought thugs' would not misunderstand what I have suggested. 
 The author leads us to believe that prohibition of drugs in any form is a terrible idea and is the reason why so many people are getting rich off of the drug trade.  His theory has many holes and though I understand what he is trying to say, I didn't like  his Marxist-style commentary.  He rambles through the first 5 chapters like a lost tourist and has some very foolish ideas on how to treat the drug epidemic.  Not one of the better books on the subject of drug use and abuse 
 Like the previous reviewer, I am a fan of Fort who greatly enjoyed Damon Knight's biography as well as Fort's work.  I also found this book to be a wretched, worthless, and unreadable book of post-modern gibberish--I couldn't get past about the first 30 pages, though I did skim the rest, which appeared to have little to do with Fort.  If you would like more insight on Fort, I recommend Knight's book and the pieces that have been published on him throughout the years in magazines such as Fortean Times by authors such as John Michell, Mark Chorvinsky, and Mike Dash, which I cited in my entry on Fort in Gordon Stein's Encyclopedia of the Paranormal 
 Just finished reading this novel this morning and I think it is probably the weakest one of the lot.  Like a lot of reviewers, I didn't find this one anywhere near as gripping or well-developed plotwise as a number of the earlier ones in the Stephanie Plum series.  As well, the supposed sexual tension- love triangle between Stephanie, Joe and Ranger is approaching its use-by date.  It is definitely becoming boring and I think Ms Evanovich needs to resolve Stephanie's romantic situation once and for all.  I still enjoy characters like Lula and Grandma Mazur but a lot of the situations Stephanie found herself in fell flat with me.  There are only so many times she can have her car blown up, handbag destroyed, apartment broken into, etc, before it becomes tiresome and repetitive.  I still think there is a spark of life in the Stephanie Plum series, but I hope the next novel is a better effort and not so much by-the-numbers as this one 
 I was looking forward to reading this book (as a former trackie). Unfortunately, the "interviews" appear to be unedited, with repetition and typo's abounding. Very little coherent material. 
 This book was a major disappointment after the author's brilliant work JIHAD.  Jihad was published just as the US was destroying the Taliban, and I had hoped that this work would bring us up to date with the invasion of Iraq.  I immediately noticed that Kepel did not bother to correct his characterization of US tactics in Afghanistan as "carpet-bombing", which it wasn't.  Then he referred to photos of American "sexual abuse and torture" of Iraqi prisoners (which was more like hazing) while calling videos of the beheading of a screaming American youth as "mistreatment."  Events have shown Kepel's earlier theory that Islamic fundamentalism is falling apart is quite correct, losing out to a rising tide of democracy in Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt, and even Saudi Arabia, but he sort of goes off the rails to talk about the Islamic diaspora in Europe and elsewhere as the hope for the future.  I guess he's afraid of not getting invited to the right cocktail parties in Paris if he endorsed anything to do with American policy 
 The trade paper back was excellent what Marvel did here was take all of the character development, internal struggles, and just about all the debth to the story and threw it out the window and taked on an alien conspiracy to make more action (because pretty explosions is the only thing we need to make a good movie right?). Buy the book, movies like this is what makes comics still look bad. worst adaptation of the year. Quality control people 
 The Crossing is set in New Mexico and Mexico in the late 1930s, during the last days of the Wild West before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all.  	The story is centred on two adolescent, monsyllabilic farmer's sons in New Mexico. When a wolf comes up from Mexico the farmer and his two sons decide to set traps and catch the wolf. McCarthy takes us into the mind of the wolf and an interesting, but sadly short, period of the book ends when the older son, alone, catches the wolf. Here he decides, rather than kill it, to return it to Mexico from where it came. When he reaches Mexico he is surprised to find the Mexicans don't see his generosity in quite the same light. After they commandeer the wolf and set it to fighting dogs Billy shoots it, and drifts through Mexico before returning home where he finds his parents murdered by horse thieves. An obvious plot at this stage would be for them to seek revenge but no. Instead they become thieves themselves and we find ourselves heading back to Mexico, with an unclear goal except to find their horses, a big country in which to find half a dozen horses, and our two protagonists becoming less and less likeable by the page. It is a pity that although McCarthy manages to take us into the mind of the wolf he never once reveals what the two boys are thinking, nor why. What motivates Billy and Boyd? For the entire book we never find out.  	 They meet a girl in an encounter that will be confusing to anyone who does not speak fluent Spanish. They also meet several Mexicans, some with their parent's horses, and they reacquire some of the horses in equally confusing scenes. Later Boyd, the younger brother, runs off with the girl; Billy returns to the USA, tries and fails to join the army (we are now in the 1940s) and so works on various ranches before returning to Mexico, for the third time, to find his brother.  	In `The Crossing' there are in fact three `crossings' into Mexico, which is projected as a lawless country full of generally unpleasant people, much like the USA. In fact, through the book there are few endearing, likeable characters that the reader can actually root for; the wolf and one or two horses are the possible exceptions. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish and difficult to follow. McCarthy may be pleased with himself for speaking Spanish but many readers of English literature do not and with so much dialogue in Spanish, and untranslated, it makes the story difficult to follow. 	This is further aggravated by a lack of proper punctuation. Mr McCarthy should remember that punctuation is something that has evolved with the English language and is there to make the language more comprehensible. To eliminate this not only distracts readers from what you are saying, but stops readers from enjoying the writing. Reading a sentence of 80 words without so much as a comma is very hard work. Lawyers often omit punctuation when writing a legal document to protect them legally. At times, `The Crossing' was much like reading a legal document, you need to read each sentence twice to understand exactly what McCarthy is saying.  Yet McCarthy still gives a compelling story described in vivid locations. Behind the faade of Spanish dialogue, unpunctuated English and dull characters there is a powerful storyteller at work here. It is a pity he chooses two charisma free lads having a loosely connected series of mini-adventures to express himself 
 As the other reviewer mentioned, the stats are all wrong in this book, some of the units listed aren't even named the same. Before publishing this book, did the editor even bother to check for accuracy or conform to the stats in the final game?? In addition there are so many typos and mislabels and erroneous info that it's ridiculous, did anyone even check this book prior to publishing?   This is nothing more than an appendix of wrong info, there is little to no discussion of strategy, of how to use individual units, what tactics to use on the battlefield, how to manage mix of castles/cities, etc. This book is worthless, having played the game for a couple of weeks, I can write a better strategy guide than this piece of junk 
 This book though looks simple and pretends to present concepts in a lucid manner, does not match international standards. Very few examples are present with less/no illustrations. I struggled with this book for almost 2 years to understand the concepts as this book was the only popular book in my UG college and was readily available in our library. It has ideally no practical examples which can easily discourage reader. After reading contemporary books from Prof Roy Yates and Prof Leon-Garcia, I could do little favor for this book by giving 1 star.   However, one who is already thorough with concepts can use this book for revision. There is a huge element of risk involved in starting with this book to learn probability concepts. 
 I've read a couple other books by Bill's books and always loved them.  Great characters, great story line, involved and wonderful.  This book was missing all of that - and then some.  The main characters are SO uninteresting that I had a hard time continuing to read.  I could have cared less if the old billionaire lived or died.  Does the married eco-freak couple actually keep the baby ... WHO CARES.    The story revolves around organ transplants, the drive of an old wealthy man to procreate and cure himself, a couple fighting for the rights of the environment, a third world organ thief of a doctor, and a crazy orphan who sells himself for a living.  Yes it has promise.  No - the story line does not deliver.  Please don't buy this book.  You'll only be disappointed 
 Don't buy this disc unless you are a real Jackie Lovell fan. The best thing in this DVD is Lovell's dance at the end 
 I'm writing because I thought Fine's review was bad. I was interested in this movie because it has Jamie Gertz, who has proven to be a durable, dependable character actress.  Mr. Fine may or may not have talent but he is not spectacular.  Waspishness insults are passe and not becoming to a serious reviewer.  Ms. Gertz, by contrast, turns an abundance of personality to good account through her career.  I just don't know what "untalented" means in the context of this silly movie, but it was twenty years ago.  Is the insult intended to be forthe movie or for her whole career since?  kBad form and fuzzy thinking.  I think the movie is an attempt to imitate features of Flashdance: upbeat background music, meaningless but interesting visuals, skill display, romance,  people with aspirations surviving at a humble level.  Jamie Gertz is the "face" girl 
 Good for the right wing, religious individual or (for those of us who are neither) those looking to expand your horizon. Must have a VERY open mind to read this book if you are not spiritual or are more liberal.  Well written, interesting arguments, just not for me 
 i ordered the book and i didnt recieve the one i ordered, i got one similiar but not the same one in the picture, i  got the international student editio 
 This was the top rated system by Consumer Reports.  I returned it.  The sound quality of the message I recorded as a greeting sounded awful as did the sound of the messages I received. Tried to record my greeting a number of ways, but they all sounded awful. 
 This would be a great idea if it were not out of date.  This uses the 3rd edition Official Scrablbe Dictionary.  The 4th edition came out in 2006.  It does not have many words, such as "za" or "qi" in it.  If there were an up to date version, I'd buy it 
 This book has a lot of great examples of illustration, but the layout of the book is way too confusing. I found myself often lost where I should continue to read. The intro for interface has very little help for the beginner to start this program. This book might be good reference for advanced users, but not for beginners. Maybe the author wants to make a nice-looking book, but this book is over-designed, lack of functionality . I would recommend video tutorial from Lynda.com, it's ideal for beginners who never used Corel Painter and Wacom drawing tablets 
 My husband and I just bought the Family Feud 2nd Edition DVD TV Games.  I have to say we both LOVED this game when it was first on (and on GSN as repeats) and I like the computer version.  We played this once by ourself and a couple of times with friends and we all have found that this game was boring & as someone said they can't believe they put this out.  If you are going to get this game then buy the computer version.  You have  5 rounds  Round #1 Round #2 Double Money Round Triple Money Round Fast Money Round  You have Team A and Team B.  If you get one wrong answer and you click wrong then it says go for steal. HOWEVER, you only get one X.  Per Guide...IF an answer is revealed that Team A did not have written down, they press Wrong Answer button and pass the remote to Team B. Team B now has the opportunity to steal the round.  So most of the game was passing the remote back and forth.  IF the steal answer matches any one of the remaining answers they steal the round (even if you-Team A had that written down) and takes the money for any answer the other team has answered correctly (even if they got 4 out of 5 and both Teams say have the same answer)  The game itself was simple and basic. There was no real fun to it.  We tried to play it with others and they said afterwards that they found it boring and not all that fun. One person said they would have more fun watching the game itself on TV over playing this version of the game.  You get two markers (red and blue) to write on the two wipe-clean score cards. The negative on this is that the markers do not write all that good on these cards even though they were meant to.  Another thing is that the same game will come up more than once. We had the same question and answer come up even though we only played twice.  This is the 3rd or 4th DVD game we have been given or bought. This is the only one where we disliked it so much after playing it a couple of times that we are giving it away as we will not be playing it again 
 This is the 3rd book I have read on The Templars. The text is a hodge-podge of interesting facts and spectulations on The Knights Templar.  The disorganization and disjointed style makes the information difficult to follow.  There is entirely too much repetition and too many rhetorical questions in every chapter.  There is virtually no chronologic order to the material.  It would have been very helpful to the reader if the author provided a simple map to indicate the location of the many places, temples, churches etc. mentioned in the text. It was difficult to know without searching other references if the location of the place, incident, battle, or refuge referred to was in the Middle East(holy lands), France, SCotland or England!    In Chapter 6, one of the contributing authors(Defoe)gives a history of the Canadian Masonic Templars and later in the same chapter, R. Lomas, presents a brief history of Freemasonary.  This was a bit perplexing and again, this underscores the disorganization of the text material.   Finally, given the problems that quickly become obvious to the reader, the editor must take some blame or responsibility for the poorly organized material of the text 
 I am a software engineer and I like to read about other sciences, but this book has disappointed me to have ideas about neuroscience. In my reading experience I found it as the most confusing book, the author talks about his life more than the science indicated in the title of the book. 
 I've heard a lot of great things about Anne Rice & her writings about Vampires & loved the movies that were based on those books (Interview w/ a Vampire, Queen of the Damned) but was sadly disappointed with The Witching Hour.  The story's plot was an interesting concept but the way she delivered it didn't suite me.  I like books that really grab you within the first couple chapters, keep you in suspense throughout & move the storyline along at a steady pace.  The Witching Hour didn't do any of that for me & hence took me much longer than most books to read.  The first 300 pgs. or so were solely devoted to character development without any connection between them until the storyline actually kicked off after all the characters had been introduced & described in depth.  Then, just as the story gets going, she stops it with a 300 pg. history of the Mayfair witches (basically, a story inside of a story... past vs. present).  I didn't have the patient nor the interest level to read it & was perfectly capable of keeping up with the story by skipping it.  And as others have stated, the editing left a little to be desired... quite a few grammatical errors.  Perhaps all these things (editing aside) were necessary to set the stage for the remaining books in the series but i don't have the patient to find out.  All in all, i wouldn't recommend the book if you like fast reads that keep you on the edge of your seat thinking "i'll read just a little more before turning out the light. 
 This book addresses some of the questions I have about alternative medicine but it is definitely not probing deeply into the questions surrounding medical treatment as was mentioned in the praise from Dr. Bill Bright  on the first page of the book. It touches the surface and quotes the Bible a little. There was not even a mention about the foods God recommends and advises not to eat.This book was a waste of my time. 
 THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a "passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential."   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.      Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.  Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its "leveling effects."    Here's the problem with her "philosophy:"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.     Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are "deep."   In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today. 
 When I realized early on the time I would waste on this assemblage of leftover quips packaged around a absurd concept, I resolved that I would alert other readers.   Generally I enjoy this author's works and anticipated this latest tome. I was surprised and dissappointed to find a lengthy novel which did nothing to disguise it's clues or probable developments. Everything was telegraphed and nothing was original. The conclusion was so lame that I was shocked that there was no effort to build suspense or intrigue.  My advice is to skip this one and wait for the reviews on his next 
 This book provides a good overview of blacks (slave and free) in New York. It's a very good reference (encyclopedic) book.  My main problem with it is that Leslie M. Harris, the author, relies heavily (if not entirely) on secondary sources. The book, then, is nothing more than a patchwork of various other more scholarly works. Hence, finding the actual primary source (i.e. court decision, council minutes, etc) proves extremely difficult.  I do not recommend this book for advanced students. If, however, you're interested in an easy read and don't care about sources, this is the book for you 
 I had previously written a review here charging Mr. Levenda with poor scholarship and libelous treatment of Mr. Aleister Crowley and "his occult orders," it has developed, on my own faulty memory of an article written by another author.  The irony of my accusing Mr. Levenda of inaccuracy based on my own forgetfulness has not been lost on me, and has been a gentleman in correcting my error.  I would like to apologize to Mr. Levenda for my thoughtlessness and plan on buying his -- I'm sure -- excellent book in reparation to him.  
 I didn't like the only other Dean Koontz book I've ever read, Watchers, but I enjoy reading Kevin Anderson's stuff so I thought I'd give Koontz another try because I'm a reasonable person and I understand that not everyone can like everything by an author.  On to the review:  I realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but I think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through.  The dialog is mind-numbing and predictable.  Every time there was a car scene I could guess what kind of conversation would be held.  "You drive too fast!"  "Are you my mother?"  Over and over and over.    The idea was good.  A modern-day Frankenstein . . . or rather a Frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day (yes, I know, Frankenstein was the doctor, not his monster.  But you get what I'm saying.).  But the dialog read exactly like a movie script would, or like a play.  This book had so much potential but the authors' laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn't made cost it dearly 
 It's an amazing phenomenon...people so smart that they are stupid.  Singer falls into that category, and I can't believe the influence this man wields.  It's mind boggling.  : /  Read this to understand his influence in our time, yes.  But don't be a sheep.  This stuff is ridiculous 
 The idea is good - admitted. But there is the problem of getting it into a novel. All the characters lack credibility, their motivations are not logical. The main character's tasks are ludicrous and the atmosphere is created in a cheap way - a way that the author thinks is traditional for the genre. The plot is improbable - which would be understandable for a horror novel -, but unmotivated and does not have anything to do with the main action. In addition it is a mixture of gore and porn, no I am not prude, but too much is too much. After finishing the novel I asked myself why I read it to the end. It could have been such a nice story. How far does a person go to get rich? There is a lot of power in this question. But in this book it is dealt with in such an absurd way that you do not answer it any more 
 We have watched others follow this advice and then with all their good efforts still lose. We need more input into the process. Finding and trusting a good attorney just isn't enough. We are going to keep looking 
 Once again, Ladinsky claims to be presenting English speaking readers with the work of the great Persian poet Hafiz, and once again, he hasn't felt the need to actually learn Persian or actually base these works on any previous translation of any poem by Hafiz. These are the poems that Ladinsky imagines Hafiz might have written had he been a twentieth century baby boomer Californian disciple of Meher Baba, instead of a 14th century Persian Sufi Muslim. Ladinsky believes (or claims to believe) that Hafiz told him these poems. If so, the afterlife hasn't done anything for the great poet's literary talent 
 If your not co-dependant before you read this book, you will be after. This book leads you to think one thing and then hits you with another at the last minute. This book will force you to seek counseling after you read it. I thought the book would be about helping me understand what to do when I feel certain feelings when others hurt me, but it's nothing like that at all. Advoid this book 
 Wow, where can I start? This book was truly dreadful in pretty much every imaginable manner. Not only was the plot completely absurd and filled with glaring inconsistencies, as already mentioned, but was totally transperant. In this type of book a little artistic license can be granted for the sake of a gripping storyline, but this book offers nothing in the way of suspense. The characters are ridiculous cardboard cutouts which do nothing to fix the book's predictability. I've never read any other of Cussler's novels (and now never will), so I'm not sure if his writing is always like this, but here he seems to have little command of the English language, his prose is drowning in mangled phrases, overblown cliches and pointless technical jargon.  A travesty from start to finish - don't waste your time on this book 
 These are the worst Elvis covers done in a studio I've ever heard. I think she must have paid them to record her! Try early 55-56 Elvis, Stray Cats or early Gene Vincent if you want to hear Rockabilly. In my opinion this is complete nonsense and an insult to the fans of Rockabilly! Save your money 
 I bought this for my SciFi class.  We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film.  It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach.  Everyone was so disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.  Bela Lugosi is a much better bet.  For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans 
   Great book, of course, but for this edition Oxford used a computer to justify the  type. On every other line you encounter three or four spaces   where there should be  only one. It may not bother most readers, but I'm looking for another    publisher's edition 
 I received wrong item, but there was no service after that 
 If you are looking for an in-depth, scholarly work on the religion and practices of Voodoo in New Orleans this is, sadly, not the work for you.  While interesting in a voyeuristic, sensationalist sense, Tallant's far-too-obvious biases and penchant for letting his interview subjects give sound bites like "Old Marie Laveau looked just like the devil herself, and she's settin' [sic] on a throne in Hell today," means that the image of Voodoo as a religion and/or money-making practice is frustratingly one-dimensional.  Tallant seems content to let his interview subjects discuss the "devil-worshipping" without giving a well-rounded picture of what actually was being worshipped.  He quotes newspaper articles with an almost pornagraphic fervor, and neglects to analyze the exoticism encoded into their language.  The book is good as a fun, tabloidesque read, and those people who have studied Voodoo religion will be able to puzzle together rites and loa blithely corrupted due to Tallant's distance from actual services.  It is also a fine study in biases of the time, but should never be read without a very LARGE grain of salt 
 The book is a good reading, interesting and stimulant, but it was too much of a subject to this distinct author, James Hillman. You need way more vision, research and knowledge of the "invisible" to make such passionated affirmations. Hillman does a great job in questioning old habits and the ugliest shortcuts of modern Psychology, and if I had to tell what's the merit of this book, that would be it. Fact is his theory for the soul's code isn't right, or isn't complete, in my view. A simple exercise of taking what he writes in this book and put under a rigorous Socrates questioning (dialectics approach) would ruin good part of Hillman's affirmations. He chose to promote the so-called "daimon" to God and in order to support this he had to ignore the real holystic Truth. He's better than the avarage Psychology, but not there yet 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 I love Michelle Branch's first CD, The Spirit Room.  But I'm disappointed in her sophomore CD, Hotel Paper. It's pretty good musically. Lyrically, it's sub-par compared to the songs from The Spirit Room. But my major disappointment is that her vocals are weaker compared to her vocals on The Spirit Room 
  It's the polar opposite of good writing.  It's so familiar, so conversational, so unturgid, and so padded with fluffy stuff it's unreadable.  Even worse than I figured it would be.  Oh, well, now i know after wondering all these years. 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 My unit failed after one day of use (never even got to the field.) Plugged it in to charge it overnight and next day only the blue LED would come on but could no longer connect. Bluetooth connections can be tricky and the paper manual provided is worthless. The on-CD manual better but is still way too spartan for a device like this.  I liked the standard mini-USB cable connection for the charger (similar feature on my RAZR) but I found it vexing that you couldn't use that same cable for data (it appears to be a standard cable) but instead have to buy a "special" cable for using the data port. They give you the mobile AND AC charger but the omission of a data cable seems odd. Other units using Bluetooth and USB (such as the 4-in-1 by Wintec) provide this. I found a LOT of complaints and kudos for this unit surfing for solutions to my issues so it appears that their are some quality control problems in the manufacturing. Folks with working units seem to love them. If you get one with the bad solder connections, you are disappointed 
 OK... this book has action. However, it seemed to me that the action sequences were not written for the readers but rather to satisfy Author's need to be tedious and verbose.   Here is a question I want to throw at the people who read this book and gave it more than 2 stars.   "How did the military test Supernova to see whether it works or not in the first place before it was stolen?"   I sure as hell would love to know the answer to this question from the readers who are hyping this book and also the author himself.   This book is trash. Dump it and move on to the next one on your list 
 Not sure about this one. Really enjoyed the Woman in White. I found this one a little tedious and slow quite despite the  very high esteem in which it is held by Wilkie fans.   
 This was the worst movie I have ever seen (and I've seen a few horrible ones!) the acting was terrible, the plot completely absurd and unrealistic, this is definitely NOT a D/s movie. I too am giving the movie away, I refuse to let anyone who is bent on seeing this movie actually pay for such an awful thing! (like *I* did) And I most certainly will never watch it again. 
 haven't received it, listed as not shipped, so why the query for a review? If you fix this glitch in your system, you don't need to post this. Doug Haye 
 Was hoping for/expecting a book with less of a religious bent to it.  Didn't realize when I ordered it that the answer to all the 'empty nest' problems and feelings, according to this book, is to pray and go to church and read certain sections of the Bible. Not good for people who want a psychological/secular read. 
 This book is so poorly written that after just 60 pages I wonder if I should even continue reading. Even if you get past the multitude of typos, incorrect grammar and inconsistencies, the total lack of structure makes this a difficut book to read. In short, it is a work of an amateur writer. That he may be a subject matter expert I don't contest, but he surely makes for a poor writer. The book is very disjointed and this makes following the reasoning almost impossible. I am very sorry I invested in this and had I had a choice I would have given it no stars. 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs

 I bought this book at a time in my life that I most definitely needed inspiration, a spark that would help me discover my calling, my "passion" in life.  What a disappointment this book turned out to be.  There was nothing new, no groundbreaking discoveries, no fresh slant on existing material.    Actually, it does provide some incentive: to write my own self-development book.  If I had sat down and written the title first - The Passion Test - I reckon I could've scraped together enough ideas and packaged them sufficiently well to rival this publication.  Hang on........I don't think I could've achieved the latter as I am definitely not as well connected as these authors.  In this age of joint ventures, I dare say these guys have created relationships with many notable authors and therefore, there book and promotional material is covered by many complimentary quotations.  In a nutshell, the book is just far too basic, too simplistic and contains no fresh ideas 
 I have owned the WMR-968 for several years now and have spent more on 'replacement' parts than if I had bought an entire new unit.  Primarily, the solar transmitter on the rain gauge continually fails to bring the charge up to enough power for the transmitter to transmit back to the base.  I have replaced this transmitter unit three times (twice with the 'new' style).  Living in the Phoenix area, we don't run into too many cloudy or rainy days, but as soon as it doesn't get sunlight for any length of time, the display reads all dashes (not receiving a signal).  So when it rains here, I usually don't get a reading of how much because this thing stops working.  The anemometer is mounted on the same pole just above the rain gauge with the both of the solar transmitters also mounted on the same pole.  The anemometer works consistently and fine.  Both OS and the local distributor say the distance is too far, the unit must have gone bad and needs replacement, etc.,etc.  Replacing the solar unit didn't help and the distance can't be too far for one unit and not the other.  No one can help with this issue.  So my suggestion would be to spend the extra bucks and get something more reliable.  
 Quite simply this was the most tastless and ignorant piece of literature I have ever read. It seemed as if the book felt like convoluting any actual storyline with scenes of gratuitous and repetive sex. Is it just me or does everyone in this damned book seem to carry a tin of vaseline? I thought there were some interesting parts but, call me a prude or an ignorant little ... but I think this book was riding on the current of the Naked Lunch which has been the wave on which Burroughs had carried his wrinkly disgusting body upon. This book is pretty much like a David Lynch film. No one gets it, they just talk about it and pretend that they do so they look intelligent but quite simply they are just beatnik sheep ready for slaughter by the corporate identity you have tried so hard to avoid with your lies and propaganda of free intellectual thought, which is disguising your true ignorance and gullibilit 
 Until now, the only movie games I found that I could enjoy with a broad spectrum of people were the Scene It? movie DVD/board game and Reel Clues. Both of these games have their advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages of these games are largely overcome in Shout about Movies.  This game is fast-paced, diverse, and generally well-conceived. The variety of questions and the creativity in presentation make this game tons of fun.  I have played with large groups (7-10 people) whose movie knowledge ranges from movie buff to casual viewer, and although there were some who were frustrated because they didn't perform as well as other players, everyone had at least a couple questions where they were the first to shout out the answer to and, most importantly, everyone had fun.  Everything is handled by the DVD interface. I particularly like the way it keeps score. The first time we played, we assumed that we would have to remember how many points each team scored during the 10-question rapid-fire rounds. But to our pleasant surprise, after each round it complete the DVD does a question-by-question re-cap and asks which team answered it correctly. This actually enhanced enjoyment quite a bit since not only did we not have to count answers during the actually game play, it also gave the group a chance to relive the excitement that occurred when shouting out answers.  The game can only be used three times, which is disappointing (hence my durability score). But when we thought about it, for about $20 our group of seven had over two hours of excellent entertainment for the evening. In our case the choices on the table were  a) all go out for dinner (very interactive, at least $8/person, probably much more) b) all go to a movie (no interaction between group members, about $8/person) c) play Shout about Movies (very interactive, and about $3/person)  So it seems pricey, but when compared to these entertainment options it really isn't that bad. And it provided much more fun than any of the other options probably would have.   Obviously, there will always be a place for games that can be played many times, but I know that I will welcome Shout about Movies as a gift and will suggest it for future large-group gatherings 
 I must admit that I find Christine Feehan's "Dark" desires deeply disturbing in many ways, and this book, along with _Dark Secret_, is the most disturbing. I was happy when rape stopped being such an essential part of romance novels; I still remember reading Kathleen Woodiwiss and Rosemary Rogers' novels when I was young and being freaked out by how often the heroine ended up falling in love with the man who had raped her. But Feehan's books have returned us to those dark days, when sexy heroes force themselves on young and innocent heroines, who then blame themselves for tempting the heroes beyond reason - just as Savannah not only excuses Gregori for raping her, but actually blames herself for wanting some choice and freedom in her life. Frankly, the whole doomed Carpathian species/lifemate thing seems like an excuse to indulge in the misogynist fantasies that say that men can't control their sexuality and that women like to be raped. It is possible to write sexy paranormal romance/erotica that doesn't indulge in the most retrogade gender stereotypes around. Try Emma Holly. 
 A thin soup of potty humor, fart jokes, and juvenile cheap laughs. You know something is terribly wrong when you are halfway through a comedy and you haven't even cracked a smile.  Good gawd, Dustin Hoffman sitting on the toilet?  Robert DeNiro breastfeading a baby? Foreskin dropped into a fondue pot?  Wow, a movie that hurt to watch.  It wasn't even worth renting for free from the public library.      
 Aside from providing a list and pictures of popular local plants, this book provides little useful information about individual species and their cultivation.  Much of each one-page species description is pure boilerplate providing generic information on planting that is repeated over and over again throughout the book, rather than being stated once in a section on cultivation.  Truly disappointing 
 Freezes IE 7 and you have to close out and restart...besides that, the other problem is slow printing because you have to use the "Print as Image" selection for anything that is scanned.  Overall it is OK, and with the vast price difference with Adobe, I can live with it.  BUT, make no mistake, this program is far inferior to the Adobe product 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this clown, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 I got through about 6 of these essays when I decided to flip through the book and read the biography of the authors since it was all starting to sound the same.  All of these women are writers!!  How is this a good sampling of real women?  These are women with careers that can be translated into part time work through free lance.  And it is difficult to feel the struggle of the women that have full time babysitters when they are "stay at home" moms.  I am a working mom in a technical field where it very difficult to take off years and then go back to the work force or do anything part time.  It would have been nice to hear the voices of people in similar situations 
 I read this book because I enjoyed Rebecca and liked the gothic feel of this novel, and it was successful in creating that classic gothic atmosphere.  However, somebody has to say something about the completely unbelievable romance side of the book.  It cheapened the entire story and just about ruined the book for me.  Mary Yellan is first presented as a strong character, one who can stand up to her abusive uncle where her aunt has caved in.  And then we are supposed to believe that she falls head over heels in love with her uncle's brother, whom we are told is merely a younger version of her uncle.  He was a repulsive character and it was not at all believable that Mary would find anything in him to be attracted to.  The whole idea turned what was otherwise a suspenseful gothic mystery into a cliched bodice-ripper.  It was almost like reading two different novels in one.  Why would a character like Mary degrade herself in this way and end up becoming just like her weak Aunt Patience who follows her husband around like a whipped dog?  Besides making me roll my eyes constantly as I was reading and wonder what kind of idiot would fall for that kind of man, this aspect of the book sends a very bad message to women. 
 This book is a disappointment. Kids may get a laugh out of it, but they won't learn anything about eating well.  I hesitate to give it to any of my grandchildren 
 I usually buy Stuart Woods books as soon as they come out,  but somehow this one I missed.   I got it recently when a bookstore had a buy 3 get one free sale.   I'm glad I didn't actually spend any money on it.   It's a fairly 'ho-hum' story, where the action just never seems to pick up.   The ending of the book was also a big disappointment for me.    I think there was so much more potential in the story, but Woods' just wasn't up to some of his better efforts.  One of my personal favorites still is Imperfect Strangers.    Some of his more recent books just haven't had the same level of suspense.     
 I will usually read and accept anything, but this book is just so beyond fact for even realistic fiction.  I could have handled this book a lot better if there was no "Frankie".  The character Frankie is just too unbelievable.  I work with "talented and gifted" children that are Frankie's age (8 years old) and not one of them is even remotely this advvanced.  If Frankie was say, 12 or 13 I could accept her maturity, her dedication to her music and so forth, but this is not even believable to anyone who has a child or works with them.  It would be tolerable if Frankie was not the center of the book.  They spend more time about Frankie this and Frakie that, then on the main plot of the book.  This is the 3rd book that I have read or at least tried to read from Iris Johansen and it will be my last.  I just don't like the way she writes or her main characters.  Evertime I buy another one of her books I am always hoping that this will be the one that changes my mind.  Oh well, another book to donate 
 OK  I  GUESS  YOU  HAVE  TO  BE  A  CERTAIN  KIND  OF  PERSON  TO  FULLY  UNDERSTAND  THIS  MOVIE.  IT  JUMPS  FROM  SCENE  TO  SCENE  VERY  FAST  SO  YOU  HAVE  TO  PAY  ATTENTION.  I  DIDNT  HATE  THIS  MOVIE.  I  JUST  DIDNT  GET  IT  I  GUESS.  MY  BOYFRIEND  SWEARS  ITS  THE  BEST  MOVIE  EVER.  THE  COSTUMES  IN  THE  MOVIE  ARE  GREAT.  IF  YOU  LIKE  STUPID  COMEDY  THIS  IS  THE  MOVIE  FOR  YOU 
 This is a barely passable pulp fiction "mystery" novel from Jonathan Kellerman revolving around a sex murder and some questionable rich kids.   In essence, this book is pretty much completely predictable, and burdened by lengthy explanations that, by the time you get to them, you've either guessed or stopped caring about.  The book starts off with premise - a young woman is brutally murdered and sexually molested, with no apparent leads, a cold case 20 years old - but it quickly degenerates, and the true perpetrators are apparent from early on.    Even as a light holiday, poolside, read - this book is lacking.  There are way too many lucky breaks and coincidences (the main character just happens to be old friends with a key witness' shrink) for this book to even approach plausible.  The characters are one dimensional and boring.  Even Milo, the gay cop, is just... boring.  Cliched.  A shabby excuse for a fleshed out character.    Give this book a pass - seriously.  I'm sure there are much better books to spend your $6 - $8 on. 
 I bought this book while researching the Logarithmic Spiral.  There were only a few references to the Logarithmic Spiral, so it wasn't spot on with what I was looking for.  However, I stayed away from this as a source because the text was difficult to read 
 I am a big Catherine Coulter fan, but this book is awful.  You can skip all the Soap scenes, a waste of space.  Much of the dialouge made no sense and the characters were very flat.  Don't waste the $6, borrow from the library if you want to read 
 I haven't been happy with this book since I purchased it. Haven't found one mark from any of the pottery or china I have from this book. Only one or maybe two examples of the companies which made the pottery but not the marks. For example I can't even find the simple "Anchor" from Anchor Hawking Co.(There are plenty of other anchors). I have a very nice Blue "Old Fashion"/juice glass fron A.H. but I have never seen one in blue. Looked it up and could not find MARK in this book. I was very surprised. I've been thinking about purchasing the Second Edition of Kovels' book, but been holding back... Can anyone tell me if it is better or if it's just me, I hope..Mary, techmom@usamedia.tv (No Solicitors Please! Only those wanting to talk about this book please reply. NO SPAMMERS!! 
 This book just rambles on and on and never seems to end.  I don't think I have ever been so disappointed in a book.  Since I started to read it, I feel like I have to finish it.  I am just praying for that day to come soon.  I have to skip over entire paragraphs just to get through a chapter.  It is overwhelming proof that hippies should NEVER write books 
 I was anticipating this book for a while.  I am a big fan of the DCU and of Green Lantern who is one of my favorite DC superheroes.  I read Green Lantern including the transition to Kyle Rayner as Green Lantern.  With that said, I am very disappointed in this novel and the concepts that it introduced.  Mr. O'Neil is a better writer than this and I am disappointed in him as well.  I was so moved (negatively) by this book that I felt I should write a review.  Like I said, I know the story about Hal Jordan and Coast City and Parallax and the eventual handing of the Power Ring to Kyle Rayner.  I have no problem when a writer massages an origin or two to make the story work.  But this felt like he took what I knew of the Justice League and it's core and Green Lantern and the Oans and put them all into a food processor.  What we got out of it looked like chunky green pea sludge.  I won't pass all the details of the story along but I felt like the author took established events in the DCU and made them into bland, trivial entries to justify the telling of his story.  The origin of the Justice League, the characterization of it's members, the use of Hal Jordan and "Di", the misrepresentation of the Oans and the Green Lantern Corps were a big pile of steaming ____.  I'm sorry, but I don't understand what the author was thinking.  Gross misrepresentation simply doesn't fit into story.  As some of the other reviewers have stated, the Kyle Rayner we see here is a whiner.  If I heard the story he told in this novel, I'd strip him of the ring and give it to someone else.  The idea that only humans have artistic concepts which is why Kyle can do so well ... crap.  And Gandy?  Please.  Ganthet was a pretty key Oan in the scheme of things with the Guardians.  The author reduced him to a cardboard cutout with Ganthet's likeness.  I just find the novel contrived and ill-thought.  If I was the author's editor and knew a quarter of what I know about the Green Lantern and his history, I would have told Mr. O'Neil to go back to the drawing board.  There were a few concepts that I had to agree with.  Some of what Kyle had to do to train.  Yes, good ideas.  The idea that the Oans have lost touch with other sentient beings.  Again, I have to agree with that.  And the portrayal of Batman, was right on.  But Kyle sleepwalking (not literally) through a third of the novel and the misrepresentation of Hal Jordan and the Oans left me ill by the end.  If this was an assignment that was turned in for a grade, I'd give it an 'F' just in the poor manner that the story was told.  Even worse knowing the history of the characters that star in it.  Mr. O'Neil, I'm disappointed in you.  You should never have turned in this story 
 The premise, the title, and even the cover art are all misleading - this book does not really explore the world of Internet dating beyond 3 or 4 `dates.' The main character, Jess, is 34, single, and envious of her sister Olivia, and Olivia's perfect marriage and children. As a birthday gift, Jess receives a subscription to an online dating site and manages to go on about 4 dates during the course of a year. Not stunning odds, and not very interesting reading either. Maybe it's just me, but I really thought this book was going to focus more on the dates and less on Jess and her sister. In the midst of the book, the story takes a drastic turn and becomes very `deep' in terms of the storyline; the storyline, which involves Olivia, just didn't gel with the rest of the book and its upbeat attitude. It was as if a large cloud came over the book midway through and it was hard to get the spirit of the book back. Jess does change throughout the course of the year, but with only 4 dates as a frame of reference, her changes are not that believable and neither is her eventual romance. I just thought this book was poorly written (which, aside from its poor storyline, is illustrated by all the swearing). Waste of your time 
 When I saw this toy at ToysRus, I thought the concept was really cute.  My 3 year old completely wore out his magna doodles, so he got this a few days ago for Christmas.  I was really disappointed because the erasing takes at least 15 strikes back and forth, and even then it does not clear the board completely.  The concept was good, it's kind of like an overhead projector and the little disc that you can trace.  Crayola has been around for many, many years.  I thought with the name and their history for putting out good items for kids who love to draw, they really missed the mark on this one.  If they had done a little more research, this product could have been great.  I am really disappointed 
 The synopsis on the back cover of Saturday overpromises by several light years when it alludes to Perowne's fight to "preserve the life that is dear to him."  I wasn't exactly hoping for an episode of "24," but why write a book with the single-day gimmick if nothing much happens in that day (save for a few minutes of terror)?  As noted by other reviewers, easily three-quarters of this story is Perowne ruminating and offering painfully minute details of his priviledged life.  Even when there is some tension and action, McEwan ruins it slathering the moment in maudlin narration.  I just wanted something to happen, rather than to hear any more about his squash game and fish stew.  In fact, here's my ugly little confession: By the end of this book, I was rooting for the neurologically doomed thug to off the entire insipid family, grandpa the drunken poet, junior the Clapton wannabe, the whole lot.  If McEwan decides to write "Sunday," we can only hope that the burning plane *is* full of Chechen terrorists, headed right for chez Perowne 
 When using this dictionary to assist me in translating some Iraqi Arabic to English I found it harder to use because it is romanized, than if they had used the Arabic script. Transliterating what I was reading into latin script so I could try and use words in this dictionary made things more difficult, rather than easier. I don't recommend it 
 This movie was so horribly bad that it wasn't even funny. A huge tornado goes through this town and supposedly rips the town to shreds. The damage? Just a bunch of stuff put in the middle of the street in nice neat piles. NO trees damaged, no pavement ripped up, no houses damaged, and no telephone poles pulled over. The worst part was that there no visible serious injuries. Sad.  The so called tornado scenes look like they were made with an Etche Sketch. The aftermath scenes were done with a dump truck and a bulldozer. The "Damaged" property was lying in the middle of the street looking like it had been looted out of the remains of a burned out goodwill store.  The worst part to me though had to be the scene in which they are standing next to their truck, in the middle of a tornado! I've had a tornado go over my house once.   A tornado is not like a hurricane, where the eye is all calm. With all the debris that a tornado picks up you'd never even get close to the middle of one in the first place. You'd be picked up and thrown around before you're even close middle. There isn't one chance in a billion that you'd drive into a tornado like a fog bank.  I think that the fact that they were able to communicate, and walk around inside the "Cone Of Silence", was the biggest joke of all. That shoulda been the title of this horidly bad. And they wonder why many directors keep their set closed to everyone and reveal only a limited amount of the plot. This was obviously a rip-off of "Twister". A cheap, no frills version that was hastily put together to beat Twister to the screen 
 UGH!  I agree, this thing is NEVER going to ship!!  I am now looking at similar products.  Not happy about this AT ALL 
 I was somewhat disappointed in this book despite its endorsement by one of my business school classmates.  Professor Tichy discusses already well known principles of leadership within the context of what is promoted as a "new" approach.  Only a few individuals and companies are profiled and are used repeatedly throughout the book.  The examples cited fit awkwardly into the message that is being presented.  The title of the book attributes greatness to the individuals profiled based on only one attribute--a belief in teaching and learning.  This seems such a narrow focus on which to base such accolades 
 This book is written by Hellen Keller, a blind and deaf woman, telling about her childhood and growing up. The book is filled with anecdotes. Each one is about a page or two long and has no connection with the one before it or the following one. The date can vary from year to year without much warning. I would not recommend this book to young readers. I am 14 and became quite confused at times. I had to read this book for school. There were some very nice points in the book, though. If you are a Hellen Keller fan, I would highly recommend this book. It is full of many things in her life that you would not know if you only read a biography or just watched one of the movies made of her life 
 This story is very dark, full of menace and dark thoughts. Not great for kids. OK for adults if that's what you like. A hard story, not much gentleness in it except for a couple of moments 
 This was not the edition I wanted, as follows: I initially found the desired edition, including a photo of the cover, followed the links for available copies, including this one which I purchased (which, BTW, did not have a photo of cover, but I assumed it was same edition as on the initial page). Was dismayed to receive this different edition. It matters because it was for a friend's college course. Professors often reference pages in the assigned edition, which do not correspond to another edition's page numbering. Please minimize such confusion by more accurate advertising (include a cover photo on every linked page, to ensure it matches the initial one) or more accurate linking--i.e. don't show a specific search result but then link to other books that are not the same one, unless again, there are cover photos or other info displayed to distinguish them 
 how could someone who can't talk and see write a book? i don't get it at all. . . this book is black magic/ the work of the devil. my christian youth group told me that satan likes this book so I will go and read my bible 
 CD is alright, innovative use of outside instruments, but the vocals need some severe resuscitation 
 After I broke up with my boyfriend (whom I lived with for almost 2 years,) I was devastated. I read this book, among many others, hoping to find some comfort or insight into the process of breaking up and grieving (with also a little humor!)   Instead, this book insulted me with its immaturity. In the first chapter, the author writes under the headline "Sassy Battle Plan" to "secure embarassing photos of him to use in the future."  I mean, if you only saw a guy once or twice and are just feeling a bit annoyed or if you still find high-schoolish "schemes" funny, than maybe this is the book for you.   But if you are looking for any kind of useful advice about grieving and moving on, this is not the book to buy. I would recommend "The Girl's Guide to Surviving a Breakup" instead... 
 After browsing through this book and realizing many of the things Jack was saying couldn't be backed up with scripture, I decided to do some research on him.  Please, Please, Please, do a simple search on yahoo.com under his name.  You will read countless reports of how the gospel he is teaching is far different from the gospel of Christ.  He uses his time at Dallas Theological Seminary to boost his credibility, but they have acknowledged his time there was long before he got into a cult movement.  Please be very weary... 
 We have had 2 of these toys - they both had the same problem as others - only says "red pan in/out"  If you slam it hard on the floor it occasionally will sing, but this is also random.  The fisher-price rep. did not seem surprised when I called to report this - told me to keep the toy I had & sent me a voucher for a new toy.  
 Unlike most others who have posted here, I didn't like Ian's Walk. I found that the story spent a lot of time highlighting how different Ian was from other kids and completely ignored anything he might have in common with his sisters. I was uncomfortable with the author's decision to state Ian's autistic tendencies in such an outright way, since clearly everyone's experience with autism is difference. I walked away from this book, thinking we could have another Rain Man catastrophe on our hands. Everyone watched that movie and figured that they understood autism, when they really just knew about one fictional man with autism 
 Like several of the other reviewers I initially enjoyed the book and felt comfortable that the stories were coming from a credible reliable source. Unfortunately the further I got into the book the more errors and implausible scenrios that came up the more I felt like I might be reading something that was 50% fiction. What a shame - once the book lost its credability I quickly lost interest and skim read a lot of pages. If I want to read made up stories about directors I'll just do it myself. As a New Zealander the worst offense for me was when she said that Peter Jackson is an AUSTRALIAN! Thats about the same as me saying that Speilberg is Canadian - hey, the countries are right next to each other so who cares. The book then stated that somebody landed at Auckland airport and promptly hired a car to drive 800 miles to Wellington to talk to Peter Jackson...thats very dramatic but very odd - most people would have walked the 5 minutes to the domestic terminal and flown to Wellington which takes about an hour.  This book rates about the same as an E-Hollywood true story which is all the more shameful if the author really did do as much research as she claims 
 "The Sound and The Fury" is reported as one of William Faulkner's early successes.  From this performance I have trouble understanding why.  The book alternates between dialogue and descriptive narration.  I had trouble following the story.  It sounded like a series of barely related scenes.  I did listen to a recording of this book.  I do have more trouble following recordings of fiction than I do with history.  It may be that I would do better reading this book than listening to it.  There was nothing technically wrong with the recording, I am just hopeful that a written version would be more understandable.  I would recommend giving a written version at try 
 Can't believe the author of the excellent Dr. Rhea novels wrote this! Unlikely premise (paranormal abilities), not particularly likeable or believable charcters, too much gratuitous violence....very disappointed.   
 When Paul Westerberg is good, he is unmatched by any songwriter out there these days.  He is capable of writing amazing pop songs, great rock n roll and wonderful ballads. He has also become consistantly inconsistent in his solo work and this batch of songs are poor examples of his potential.  Only "The Right to Arm Bears" seems worthy of release on a high profile soundtrack geared for kids, while the other tracks sound too familiar to these ears, relying on tired riffs and borrowed melodies, sounding too mature for the kids in the audiance and too uninspired for the adults who still care. Apparently Paul is being considered for a grammy for the song "I belong" which could be a blessing or a curse for our old boy.  He deserves the recongition for his great songwriting career and he certainly deserves to get "real paid" after all this time, but he will then be joining the company of other grammy winners writing lukewarm drivel for the masses.  I was highly disappointed by this collection of songs and it is one of the very few PW releases that I cannot recommend 
 Slate magazine's little item might not be bad, if somebody else hadn't done it better, years earlier.  Since the 1970s, the Chicago Reader Newspaper has had a column called "The Straight Dope" by Cecil Adams, which provides more accurate information, better writing, & more witty reparte'. The Straight Dope online website has frequently made "PC Magazine"'s list of "Top 101 Websites", & Random House's "Rough Guide To The Internet" lists it as one of the best general information sites on the Web.  Don't settle for this poor copy--go search under Author's Name : "Cecil Adams" in Advanced Search, & buy one of several collection of the better product 
 I approached this book with an open mind, but after I stumbled upon a couple of obviously wrong and some nonsensical statements, I started reading it much more skeptically, and finding more and more problems with it. (However, it did provide more fun ;))  The book has a good premise, trying to explain information system with the factory metaphor. Although authors give some good insight in the way IS should or could be thought of and modeled, there are many instances in the text where you read something and say to yourself "what where these good people thinking". This then undermines your confidence in their vision and full understanding of the matter. And although I think this is a matter of personal preference, authors sometimes seem to be in love with their style, producing some beautiful nonsense like this: "The legacy environment is only a very small vestige of its former invincible self." (pg. 42)  Let me give you some more examples of what I'm talking about: Authors create metaphors of user classes, calling them "tourist, farmer, explorer and miner", which in itself is not a bad idea, but then they go on to say "...farmers found at the ODS environment are quite different from the farmers found at the data mart". So why did you create the single metaphor then?  Also, check this out: "A miner will typically look over many, many rows of data...". As opposed to what, just a "many rows of data"? Whence some people might need "not so many rows of data"? Like I'm reading a book for my eight-year-old, for goodness sakes!  Then there is this graph showing the directional flow of data, but then it reads: by the way, in all this streams, data can sometimes ("in 1-5% of the cases" - authors never say how they got these numbers, it is all a slight of hand) flow in the opposite direction!!?(Pg. 24) And they go about giving 5 examples, 4 of which are wrong - there is no data flow in them at all! Example:"...sales dept. notes that loans are slowing down. The decision is made to reduce home loan rates by 1/2 percent." This is not the back flow of data, as authors assert, it is an information feedback loop that involves people (management), and their decisions. Data (loan rates) is not coming back from Data Mart. User is somehow entering it into Operational system (application). His decision is influenced by data analysis, but it does not reverse the data flow. The fundamental issue here is that authors ignored the fact that information processes in the company involve people as well as the data and systems, and should be modeled as such. To use their metaphor, users should be a part of the information ecosystem. Hence it is not true that, as the book claims, corporate information factory embodies the information ecosystem. (Pg.7)  "...'event' date ...reflects the moment in time when the data in the record was accurate". (Pg. 96) This is incorrect. 'event' date is just recording the time of that single event. Record is always accurate after that, it does not 'age' with time.   At pg. 191 it is asserted that Data Warehouse provides "depth" to the data. That is true only if it is built (modeled) with "depth" requirements in mind. Before I can get "deep" information from the DW, I must build it with my questions in mind, otherwise, it will not give me data. An abstractly deep DW does not exist. It is always an answer to a particular question, or number of questions.   "The Dimension of History" (pg. 193-194) is just plain good old nonsense, with example (life stages of an individual) being completely off the mark. Reminds me of the student who does not know the correct answer to the question so he tries to invent some plausible response, letting his imagination fly ... Sad.  And so on, and so on...  I saved the best ones for the end:  "...the external world is full of normal occurrences and normal events. The very ordinary nature of the external world makes us take it for granted." (Pg. 49) Very philosophically deep, indeed ;) "The emergence of the integrated applications comes slowly and, in many cases, imperceptibly" (pg.42) Yeah, it just creeps on you when you're not looking... ;) ".. the back flow of the data is minuscule to the point that in some cases it is so small as to be unmeasurable". (Pg. 23)  :0 Beg your pardon? This is not quantum physics, guys, this is computer science. Anything can be observed, perceived and measured to the level of a single bit. Or are we talking bit-quarks here? Informational principle of uncertainty?   It is disappointing to have this book co-authored by the "father of the data warehouse".   To the (prospective) readers: This is a fun book if you are an experienced data architect, bad if you wish to use it as a blueprint for your work, and dangerous if you are an IT manager and impose it on your staff.  To the authors: Give us a break, please go back and re-make a decent book around the good basic idea. Less poetic style would also be appreciated. Forget about quantum physics. And give it to some unbiased reviewers first. Remember, only the real friends will tell you the unpopular truth. 
 Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.    
 OK, i can't deny it, this book was well written. But what made me throw up is the age differance, i mean what the hell! how can Tana like someone who's 30 years older than her? that's aweful! this is what i really hate  about Dan's books, she hooks someone who's 20 with some1 who's 35. i don't  find that interesting. all i can say about full circle is that it's good  but so depressing. it made me cry( which proves that Danielle is a good  writer) don't read this book if you are not ready to get depressed 
 I order the 2004 artist market an good this 1994 artist market. they will not refund my money 
 Keegan started out years ago with a bang with The Face of Battle, in which the post-Vietnam and, for the UK, a post-Empire spirit made for a genuinely innovative military history.  This early promise has NOT been fulfilled, and Keegan has declined considerably in quality because he's become co-opted by the Establishment, a post-Empire, Blair establishment every bit as corrupt as Haig.  Keegan has never served in combat yet loftily recommended in the 1980s that the "tempo" of the next war (which as a Sandhurst insider he was probably planning) be increased to 24/7. In this, he gave NO consideration to the high levels of post-traumatic stress and the war crimes that have resulted from the US policy of "no sleep until Baghdad" in the second Iraq war.  Keegan is post-Sixties, all right, but instead of peace and love, he's a Nietzchean who'd wage war with the poor man's body.  His "war" is chateau generalship by the rich, actually fought, 24/7, by British working class lads, blackfellows from Britain's few remaining colonies, and of course Americans.  Keegan popularized and made respectable for a new generation the old lie, subtly and over time, dulce et decorum. Precisely by foregrounding war's utter brutality he made it somehow acceptable and ONCE AGAIN a test of manhood, and this has gotten people killed.  His book on Military Intelligence managed, idiotically, to dismiss MI as secondary and not critical precisely, almost to the day, when the American and British MI was declaring victory (remember Mission Accomplished?) and failing to see how disbanding the Iraqi army would create the insurgency.  The Iraq War recounts the war as a board game with neither any anticipation of the postwar mess nor any compassion whatsoever for the men and women who fought it, or the Iraqis brutalized. At key points, it expresses a puzzlement about the failure of Iraqis to greet their "liberators" which shows a willful incomprehension of anything outside military science.  Ignore all writings by John Keegan until he issues a public apology for the lives this twit has destroyed while sipping pink gin at Sandhurst. For a good history of the Iraq War cf. Thomas E. Ricks, THE IRAQ WAR 
 I was very disappointed that the songs on this album were not a comprehensive list of the songs that I saw in the movie. It's a compilation of mediocre songs. Big disappointment 
 == quote  Moon's activities, which include recently crowning himself "King of America" in a Senate office building is almost to surreal to believe.

Sun Myung Moon was dubbed the king of peace at a coronation ceremony in the Dirksen Senate Office Building attended by several members of Congress.   Moon is the founder of the Unification Church - currently known as The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification.

 The item was not as pictured.  It is funky and of poor quality.  The seller did not respond when I contacted him about this 
 I really hoped this book would live up to its promising title.  Unfortunately it turned out to be not only "all over the place" in terms of its approach to the subject matter, but alternately banal and inexplicably eccentric in adducing historical example.  The author jumps heedlessly back and forth between the strategic and tactical levels of war as he considers the history of warfare (in the West), along with mass armies, railroads, sea power, and other of the usual topics.  Regrettably his organization of the material never acknowledges the role of the operational level of war in bridging strategy and tactical battle through campaigns; this oversight produces insights that are, to the military mind, humorously banal, such as the following:  "Offensive operations then get launched even where states had defensive intentions." (p.11)  One is tempted to respond, "Duh, Shraggy."  (Quester attributes this phenomenon not to the considerations of geography, tactics, weapons capabilities, politics, and alliances that normally go into such operational choices, but to what he calls the "offensive" character of technology.  Reducing the conscious human choices of offense and defense to automatic consequences of the technology of weapons is only one of the disservices done by Quester's tendency to extrapolate backward from his organizing model:  the unique constraints imposed by global thermonuclear weaponry during the Cold War.)  The questionable invocations of historical trends, causes, and effects are too numerous to catalogue.  Examples include the assertion that "the significance" of agriculture to warfare is the necessity it implies to defend territory; whereas it seems more significant to mankind's development that agriculture uniquely promotes creation of the wealth and societal stability that alone enable long-term conquest.  In another example, Quester overstates the influence of Clausewitz on Imperial Germany, suggesting that he "taught the Germans to be 'too total' " (in waging war) in the years prior to WWI.  This characterization of German strategic policy in the 19th century, a policy that exemplified "limited war" for subsequent generations of strategists, is oddly unwary, at the very least.  The reader should be wary on encountering in the 2002 Introduction such passages as these:  "Most of us, during the Cold War, would have given Marxist ideology credit for... teaching the peoples under Communist regimes to cease any hating of each other based on old ethnic differences." (p. xiii)  Well, no, I don't think most of us would.  This statement is made in service of Quester's point that the technology of weapons is more "malleable" than human intentions have proven to be -- but again he misses the whole intermediate step of crafting the military execution of those intentions, presuming that directing a war is no more complicated an act than pulling a trigger, and that therefore the weapon is everything.  This is indeed the bottom line of the book:  Quester has in mind the astrategic threat of nuclear weapons, and that colors all his conclusions.  In the Introduction to the 1988 edition he writes:  "The highest goal of the weapons planner...should be to design weapons systems that consistently and reliably reward the defense, making it to everyone's advantage to do nothing in a crisis."  Reading this on p. xxxi, one might be excused for seeing no great reason to continue further.  And with the exception of a few useful insights on the dynamics of balance of power politics and defensive alliances, one would be right.   
 Imagine someone combining the scripts for Zardoz and Independence Day and letting a troupe of inebriated special education students control the acting and directing....then you would have Battlefield Earth.  It is so bad it actually has some entertainment value which elevates it to two stars.  You become mesmerized as you sit back and consider that this is the end result of John Travolta putting his heart and soul into a project.   Just awful. If Battlefield Earth and Pluto Nash were humans they would deserve to be executed 
 I've had this scale for over 10 days now but I am returning it tomorrow morning. It is not accurate AT ALL 
 Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.   My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here 
 This soundtrack is terrible, and I have loved most of Vangelis work for more than twenty years. The only good cut is "Titans" dont waste time on the rest.  
 This book is the worst book I ever had since I was born. The author did not do a great job constructing sentences (or should i say did not know how to). His ideas were too vague, his sentences were too confusing and its very impossible to learn and understand American history if one is going to use this book alone, especially if he is not an American who had American history in high school. If you are not American and have no idea of American history and need to use this book, DROP THE COURSE. Its better to drop early than suffer the consequences of failing the course. If there were a -99 rating, I'll give it a -100 
 So, I bought it, viewed it and realized that it was THE VILLAIN I saw/liked. This movie is  the personification of why studios shelve movies. A boring mush of wasted star power, illogical , unfocused characterizations, plotting and irritating meaninglessness.   Now, to go buy THE VILLAIN and revisit a cynical, black-humored, hopefully funny western of the Golden Seventies 
 It's a wonder how people (99% anonymous) can write glowing reviews of this book and throw around words casually like "compelling", "powerful", etc. It's also a shame to see people so blindly read the INTERPRETATION of what this woman read as being her grandmother's history.   Another point about this novel - Who cares! It's a book about her supposed discovery of her heritage, of which she researches, writes, gets published and gets paid for. Does your story really warrant a book? Why don't the lot of us do exactly as Ms. Lee does and discover our own lost heritage, write about it, and package it as our own [insert background title here]? Apparently since her publishing, the likes of which people strangely lap up and call "amazing", Lee is now on the lecture circuit, going from one university to another lecturing on this. Is this for real? Is she now a certified expert in Korean history? Do not pass Go, do not collect your PH.D in History, instead write a fictitious book based on archival information and go straight to expert? Give me a break. This book is contrived.    1/5 stars. 
 Truly amazing. Finally a book that captures the essence of disgusting. Words cannot describe the dullness that drifts from the pages of Black Rage, like the smoke from a factory. A thought that could have been condensed into a sentence or two the authors have managed to expand into 200 pages of nothingness.  Though it may have started off as a cute idea, it quickly turned into a nauseating yet boring book. If you enjoyed Black Rage you may also enjoy the encyclopedia, thesaurus, or just sitting in a room for hours doing nothing 
 This book is one of Dean Koontz's worst.  Not as bad as THE TAKING, but right in there.  OK, here is the plot ... really, really bad guy kills girl and parents.  A girlfriend witnesses and escapes only to find herself in the hunt for really, really bad guy.  Girlfriend chases really, really bad guy and craters the guy, but that's not all.  During this (yawn!) high drama, the heroine finds a little girl that really, really bad guy has (yawwwwwn!!) captured.  After knocking off the really, really (yawwwwnnnnnn!!!) bad guy, heroine rescues little girl and adopts her. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!! Oops, sorry, I nodded off.  Please Dean, can you recall this book?  I mean we aren't asking for an apology here -- just take this piece of junk off the market.  I did see where "new and used" has it for as little as 1 cent.  Uhhhhhh!  DON'T SPEND IT !!! It is not worth it !!!!  And Dean, when you are going to give your email address out to the fans?  Most authors do this.....but, you seem to be reluctant.  Could it be literary cowardice?  Inquiring minds want to know.    Much of Dean's work is excellent ..... this book isn't.  Densel Myers Yukon, Oklahom 
 Here it is again! Another typically deplorable biography on Thomas Jefferson from another PC historian. What a shame that the American History "profession" has once again provided us with a biased, politically correct, and slander ridden assault on the personage of Thomas Jefferson. Joyce Appleby spends more time bashing him for his views on women, indians,and slaves that you really never see the great human being who wrote the Declaration of Independence. All the typical left-wing anti-white male PC ad hominem attacks are there. I personally would not waste another dime on a book by Appleby, but if one wants a book that once again trashes an American hero, buy this one 
 I have been doing a lot of reading on Welles for a research project and while it is clear that Welles was no angel, this book seems to go out of its way to put Welles in the worst possible light.  There are too many flights of fancy and liberties taken.  For example, based on no evidence Thomson suggests that not only did Welles have sexual relations with Dorothy Commingore but that he practically raped her.  Perhaps the book reveals more about the author than it does about its subject.  There are some useful takes  on lesser known figures like John Toland but on the whole it is a book to take with several grains of salt 
 A glorified cliche, this book does little justice to Shakespeare's writing ability as it isn't nearly his best work. Its marvellous dissemination and public love and recognition beffudles me. Superficial, lackluster, and diaphanous often foolish and loathsome compourtment and intelligence of the characters makes this book nothing more than a wonderful waste of valuable time. Never has Shakespeare created a work so imbued with cliches and idiocy. Basically, Romeo and Juliet is a story about two romantically-impaired "star crossed" lovers who have to avoid the obstacles presented by the feud between their families to realise and consummate their ephemeral marriage. They arent star crossed! They are inane idiots too immersed in "love" to recognize the imprudence of their actions. Their deaths were not the least bit pitiful, but risible. Cognitive, yes. Irritating, yes. Interesting? No. The utter folly of the characters is murderous, very uncharacteristic of Shakespeare who usually presents intelligent and philosophical personages. Do not base your opinion of Shakespeare on this pathetic work, he has created and transcended this one with a myriad of his other much more meaningful and enthralling plays. I d much rather recommend Midsummer Night's Dream or Hamlet 
 The author clearly believes you should train an infant and not use diapers. But then there isn't a clear plan for training a baby. This is kind of a mix of lots of ideas without a committment to one specific plan. Kind of confusing, not too helpful. 
 George Benson is one the greatest guitarist of all time.  I bought this CD with the hope of hearing George Benson play the guitar with the skill and passion that most professional performers could only dream about.  George Benson did come through on two of the three purely instrumental tracks, "Softly, As In a Mountain Sunrise" and "Arizona Sunrise."  These are the only two tracks produce by Paul Brown.  The other instrumental, "Take You Out" is a tribute to Luther Vandross and is on the "Forever, For Always, For Luther" CD.  George Benson does showcase some of his talent, but he kept the song true to Luthers' rendition "Take You Out."  The bottom line is: if you think George Benson is a great vocalist, you will love this CD, and in my opinion, he is just tolerable.  Three instrumental tracks, seven vocal tracks, this CD is not "Irreplaceable."  
 Order placed by 7th of July didn't arrived by now. No sunglasses... No money... No response from the seller... The most awfull seller I have ever co-operated with.... I wish I would not ordered this nice glasses from this dishonourable seller.... Think twice before placing an order & paying money.. 
 Is it just me who thinks that the Discworld has lost its life? I always loved Discworld- I read and re-read every book up to Fifth Elephant with gusto, and I loved them like no other books in the world. But when I read Fifth Elephant, I found something had changed. There is just no life to this book. It wasn't remotely funny, the plot was confusing and unexciting... I don't know why, but I just didn't enjoy reading this one. I got bored with it after the first few pages, and it was a chore to read the rest. It was awful for me; like having a good friend suddenly turn on me. Every book following Fifth Elephant has, in my opinion, only gone downhill. It's not that Pratchett has run out of ideas, but that he seems to have lost his enthusiasm. It's horribly depressing 
 I had to use this book because it was required for the physiology course I took, and the test questions were taken from it.  However, it is the most sloppy textbook I have ever dealt with.  It is so cryptical and convoluted, it actually makes the material HARDER to learn.   (For example, bizarre acronyms are introduced in the answers to sample problems that are never even been discussed in the text itself.)  The different sections of the book refer you back and forth to one another without explaining anything in a basic way.  In addition, the index is terrible, so you can't even try to dope things out on your own.  I would advise you to not get this book if you can avoid it, especially if you are a student trying to learn this material for the first time 
 In this book, Byron York only promises to present the evidence of a vast Left-Wing conspiracy - and that is all he presents.  The discussion here is limited to what left-leaning money has done. Primarily, this amounts to a muckraking castigation of George Soros for pointing out the fascistic tendencies inherent in Bush Administration policies and a denigration of Soros' concerns that the US is now, currently, moving in the same direction as NAZI Germany in the period between the World Wars.  There is no discussion here of any sort of moneyed conspiracy on the other side of the aisle:  no reference to the vast amounts of AmWay (DeVoss family) money available to smear Democrats and moderate Republicans; no reference to the vast amounts of  WalMart (Walton family) or Timkin (Timkin family) money available to do away with a justified and justifiable estate transference tax; and absolutely no reference to the extremely close, and extremely profitable, relationships between George Bush and Ken Lay (Enron) or between George Bush and Jack Abramoff (Republican corruption and treason) 
 There are very few primary sources one can find when studying Latin American revloutions, with Argentina being the subject here. This being a primary source, isn't one that should be taken for an overall look on the Argentina Revoultion. Sarmiento has a sort of bias that shouldn't be taken too seriously. It is hard to get really a good account of Juan Facundo Quiroga because he is such a vague figure in Argentinian history. This is probably the only elaborate interpretation of the figure. Sarmiento also has a sort of habit to go off on tangents on things that are totally irrelevant to the subject matter at hand.  Domingo F. Sarmiento is of European descent and has a biased for "civilization" and defies everything that is "barbaric" as he puts it, which really is what the story is about, and his protest to Rosas one of the leaders of Argentina at the time this story was written who is also "barbaric". The author compares "civilizations" and "barbarism" and how the "barbaric" gauchos are a threat to society. Facundo is a gaucho and is interpreted by Sarmiento as a dicator who made is way to the top by hate and carelessness and is partially at fault for the state of "deterioration" that Argentina was presently in during mid-19th century Argentina.   All criticism aside, one does get good descriptive imagery of the man that was Juan Facundo Quiroga. Due to the fact that this book was written on a sort of bias, it would be better if it was written under a more accurate scholarly account, but then again it is a novel and that is what makes it interesting. It is by no means a useful primary source. 
 Chet Baker certainly does have his apologists.  Phrases such as, "He can't sing, but ..." are repeated like mantras.  Fact is, he just plain can't sing.  He has a sort of hipper-than-thou whisper that broadcasts, "I'm such a sensitive artiste."  For some reason, people bought it.  Blame it on the good looks, the smack habit, the James Dean act, and the times, which glorified everything unstudied and done badly - (read Kerouac).  He was a nice, if unremarkable, horn man.  But that singing, wow.  You'll get more passion from your dishwasher, and more technique too.  Baker's real brilliance was in passing off attitude for art, something that survives to this day.  He was at the avante garde of being a poseur.      
 Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less 
 This is an extremely interesting biological and viticultural story. Unfortunately the history is poorly and haphazardly organized. Although Campbell strives to make the characters (scientists, viticulturists, and bureaucrats)three dimensional - his insistence on chronologically following the activities of multiple individuals comes at a high cost of understanding. The story would have been better told - I feel - by focusing on fewer players or including a more organized interspersion of biological context 
 This book has nothing to offer, except for those of you who now nothing about Orisha Tradition, and are curious. Otherwise don't waste your time and money.. 
 This book is not good for the beginning yoga guru.  You need a "speak and sound" machine for all the yoga jargon in the book--otherwise you get caught up in the hard-to-pronounce names and words.  Every couple of chapters there would be some insightful information to help you along "your Quest", but the final chapters tell you that you didn't need the book in the first place 
 A friend going through the same problems as I am was strongly recommended this book by her therapist and she bought it for me, as well.  I was enthusiastic to read it and at least understand these emotions.  If I could actually use the information to help myself, all the better.  I was warned that the beginning was a bit slow and hard to get through, so I struggled through it, expecting it to get easier to read.  It didn't.  It's been sitting by my bed for months with the bookmark at page 104 and I'm really sorry because I'm sure that the contents are useful and interesting, but I just can't get past that page 104.  I normally refuse to leave a book half unread, but this just has to be an exception because every time I pick it up I fall asleep within 3 or 4 pages.  I agree with some of the previous reviewers that there is way too much emphasis on the actual workings of the meetings.  I feel like I'm watching a video of it, as every minimal thing is described in incredible detail.  But I wanted to read this book to understand the views and conclusions of the group, not to become an expert on the tea breaks they had.  Also, I felt lost as the scientific tests they had previously carried out were explained in such detail, I ended up having to skim over some sections.  This may be a great resource for those who have great patience and/or a scientific background, but too much for a regular Joe like me 
 This press worked great, but only for about a month.  After that the press disc would not stay attached to the end of the plunger when I was pressing.. 
 I agree with a couple of posts that say this is a very basic book, and that most of the information could be found for free on the internet.  I would go as far as to say that some information would be better if read on the internet.    The examples about pivots (the key part of the book), one chart after another were not easy to follow.  The section on TA was woefully lacking.  The author has a section on Gann theory, and more or less advises to go buy the book that Gann wrote.  As it turns out, there is some pretty rich information about Gann on the web.  My biggest pet peeve about this book were the continual subliminal references (advertisements) to the author's subscription based website.  Besides that, I did not like the blatent plugging of the people who praised his book on the back cover.  It's okay for an author to put their website on the back of the book.  If the information stands on it's own then I can go to the website to learn more.  What's not cool is to give vauge trading strategies, then give some glowing account of how your subscription newsletter called the shots.  I did give the book two stars, which means I wasn't totally dissapointed.  He does stress a couple of good points regarding pivots, but it's all pretty basic beginner stuff 
 The computer I have now(about 500 Mhz)is faster than my last one, and the earlier version of Plus! worked well with my older model. However, my current model can't process most of the programs available, so I just deleted the whole package. I intend to get a faster computer in the near future, and will use SuperPack at that time. The features look pretty cool, but I can't give it a favorable rating at this time. However, when I see how it would work with a faster processor, I may re-rate my review 
 There's one thing you will learn at the end of this movie (and it isn't even the title); that Mel Gibson is a good looking man. That's pretty much it.   So, Mel can read women's minds. So cue LOTS of scenes of women checking him out, forming clear, straight sentences in their minds (does anyone talk to themselves like the women in this movie? If anyone could read anyone's mind, wouldn't it just be a bunch of indeciphrable gibberish, half sentences, words, songs and ideas?)  But I digress. I can buy any premise if it's well thought out and, for a comedy - funny. And this isn't any of those things. Instead we get to see Mel mugging to the camera for an hour and a half until all you want to do is smash his head in with a shovel, Psycho II style. "Are you sure you won't have any tea, Mel? CLANNNNNNNG". Now THAT I would watch.  So, is this DVD What Women Want? Maybe, but only the really stupid ones.  The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.u 
 I bought this carseat (different color) because I liked the features.  However, everytime I put my now 5 week old in the seat his head plops forward.  I have tried everything, from putting a diaper or towel around his head because the headrest sucks, to trying to push the base down so it doesn't sit up so high. Do you know how nerve wrecking it is to be driving just to look back and see you newborn's head ploped forward so bad that he is choking.  Not good Graco, this carseat could not have been tested before.  I had an Evenflo with my previous child and did not have this problem.  I am truly disappointed.  Can anyone could tell me how to make this problem go away, I am all ears.  I know the seat is right because the balance window is all blue.  I have talked to other mothers and they have the same problem.  HELP!!! 
 Now this books title is MISLEADING. It should be called "HOW I GOT BRAINWASHED INTO BEING A VEGAN"! Very little of this book has to do with women's health. It advice you to not to eat oil, fish, milk and meat, basing their "science" on statements, NOT FACTS! Very often source is not given or the logic is faulty. For example, at some point in the book you can find a statement like: your morning egg carries salmonella because chickens peck at each other because they are in cages.  BEWARE of this GARBAGE. What a waste of paper!! 
 I'd heard the buzz (both pro and con) and thought I'd take an independent read. I was dismayed with this book. James Frey has insulted anyone who has gone through a real experience with substance addiction by trivializing the truth of whatever experience he really had. One of the hardest things an addict has to grasp is the TRUTH so that he can take ownership of his actions and take the 12 steps or whatever is necessary to save his life and often the lives of loved ones tangled up in the mess with him. Lies are what enable "slips" and "enabling" and "denial" and those other catch words that describe continued misery and failure. Recovery is nearly impossible without honesty. So, can we look at this man's "memoir" and expect it to offer anything of value? It's poorly constructed, repetitive, and narcisitic. Even if Oprah hadn't exposed him, the writing takes the tone of "whoppers" like Frey's account of the drug house visit in which he "rescues" Lilly. Other reviewers and Smoking Gun have written about the fantastic episodes one by one, and I can't improve on that. Suffice to say this mockery of misery and hope is no more real than a daytime soap opera.  Story lines in a soap may look like real life to one who is isolated from real life, the same way A Million Little Pieces might look to someone who has not been touched by real addiction. A real addict with typical delusion could be misdirected from a true course of treatment with tragic result. I was left with the impression he thinks institutions and people who help others with substance recovery are pitifully misdirected or inept. Like a joke of some kind. I'm not laughing. 
 Even with the questionable veracity, I enjoyed Frey's first book, A Million Little Pieces, since it stayed true to an addict's experience.  Leonard, on the other hand, came off as pure fantasy, with very little substance.  Even the description of Frey's struggle was too contrived to be believable.  It was not even interesting as fiction. 
 Perhaps with time Ehlers writing improved but I found most of this book to be unclear - except the parts at the end about how to use the MESA cycles for trading. He has one idea, a ELI (Ehlers Leading Indicator), that sounds  intriguing but darned if I can figure out how to calculate it based on his  passing description of it. When he tries to explain phasors by "think  of an engine" example, he only made me more confused. I really want to  understand the mathematical ideas presented herein so I'll keep at it but  I'm hoping I'll find a cycle writer with a style I can decipher better.  Haven't read his later stuff yet though. Maybe he got alot more clear 
 I was totally taken by surprise when I received the book - yes, in hardcover - that was no larger than my palm. While humorous, I know little more than before I read the book. I was trying to be less ignorant about golf, but the glossary of terms was poorly done. I still don't know what "par" means 
 While the author heaps truckloads of eulogies about "honor, integrity and deep moral convictions" on a man whom Gen. Douglas MacArthur should have hanged as a traitor, the fact is, it was Truman's flagrant disregard for the U.S. Constitution that gave him the "fortitude" to support the invasion of a foreign nation. The 1st Amendment, as we all know, clearly states, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion..."  While everyone is at liberty to endorse and support whatever religious cause or organization they choose, our government is supposed to remain neutral on such matters.  As was the case with Harry "atomic bomb" Truman, left wingers always refer to the first amendment when it serves their purpose to subvert our institutions but always flagrantly violate it when it is convenient for them to do so.  To refer to Harry Truman, who was directly responsible for the systematic slaughter of American soldiers during the Korean War, the Massacre at Hiroshima, the betrayal of China to his Communist friends, the communising of Europe, as a man motivated by deep moral conviction, humanitarianism, etc, is enough to make anyone puke 
           	I am a mathematician with extensive experience in electrodynamics and quantum mechanics.  I read this book to teach myself quantum optics. Since I read it as a self-study text,  I will review it from that perspective.  	I didn't find this to be a good pedagogical book. It is the first quantum optics book that I read, and I didn't get much out of it. Thinking that perhaps the problem was inadequate background, I then read from cover to cover Elementary Quantum Optics by Gerry and Knight. Although there are some problems with the latter  which are addressed in a separate review, it did make more sense.  	With Gerry/Knight under my belt,  I returned to reread Scully/Zubairy. It didn't make much more sense the second time than the first.  	The presentation of Scully/Zubairy is often sloppy  and too diffuse.  Like too many physics texts, it  doesn't always carefully define all its symbols, and  it frequently sneaks in important assumptions  without explicit mention. It demands a lot of guesswork from the reader.  	For example, Chapter 1 tells us that        "as we will discuss in [Chapter 4],      the probability of exciting an atom ...       is governed by [formula (1.5.12)]".  This is a crucial formula, one of the most important in the book. If the reader turns ahead to Chapter 4,  he does reassuringly find it in equation (4.2.4).   The impression given is that it has somehow been derived in the intervening 100-odd pages.   But it hasn't,  so far as I have been able to discover.    	Is this crucial formula  a new assumption of quantum optics,  or does it somehow follow from  established quantum-mechanical principles? The reader is left to guess. Readers who are satisfied  to accept unmotivated statements on authority may be happier with this book than  readers who seek a fundamental understanding of  the logical structure of the subject.  	I was particularly interested in the  Hanbury Brown and Twiss experiment treated in Chapter 4,  so I read that chapter particularly carefully. Indeed I read it very carefully several times,  but I was forced to consult other sources  to understand this experiment.   I think that the text's treatment omits important, non-obvious assumptions and contains some errors. However, study of other sources finally convinced me that  the text's final result, equation (4.1.26),  is probably correct.  (Incidentally, I think that the treatment of this important experiment in Gerry/Knight is also inadequate.)  	Figure (4.6) which purports to be  a diagram of this experiment contains a component which produces a "delay time", but the text's analysis  never explains the purpose of this component. From other sources I've learned that  the delay time is extremely important for some variants of this experiment. This is fairly typical of the text's haphazard approach.  	Chapter 20 discusses a "quantum eraser" experiment whose  result is so startling that Scully and Zubairy  cite Jaynes as considering it  a paradox, a "violent irrationality"  (as Scully and Zubairy paraphrase Jaynes). It certainly seems that way to me,  and I would very much like to understand this experiment better.  	Scully and Zubairy never make clear if this is an actual experiment which has been performed,  or a "thought experiment". Surely the exposition of such remarkable claims should be more explicit.  	They present a calculation which is claimed to  "resolve the 'Jaynes paradox'". I was disappointed that I could not follow this calculation because its exposition is far too vague. In particular, they obtain their main result, equation (20.3.5), under the assumption that "the interaction Hamiltonian  ... depends on symmetric combinations of the field variables, so that only the symmetric state ... will couple to the fields". This might be convincing if they had ever defined their "interaction Hamiltonian", but the reader is left to guess at which interaction Hamiltonian they might be using.  	I cannot recommend this book for readers  who are not experts in quantum optics. I cannot judge whether it might be useful to experts 
 Loved his other books but this was all over the place, hard to read, and to apply 
 I have heard this CD (25 Romantic Classics). The main problem in the 25 tracks is that most of them are not pure romantic music. The Air on G string could not be classified as "Romantic" because the general theme is closer  to  tragic than romantic. The same thing goes for Vivaldi's allegro. The  Performance of Mozart's Piano concerto in A made by the poor "Israel Chamber Orchestra"  is weak, and i am still wondering of putting this performance in the CD Although  There are  dozens of great performances for Mozrat's piano concertos. The performance of Beethoven's Fur Elise is quite poor. it went faster than the usual, in addition to extreme use of the sustaining pedal. I Believe that any amateur could perform it better than the soloist here. I wonder why t Chopin's prelude no.7 is in such a CD, its quite out of any conceivable thematic context in addition to being to short. preludes such  No.6 (the Tolling Bells) and No.15 (Raindrops) could have been much better for such a CD of romantic music. Add to that, the  pianist didn't use the tempo rubato in playing this piece. So the semi-romantic piece was totally destroyed. The rest of the tracks too humble for the serious critic. I don't believe that this CD makes any addition to any classical collection 
 The premise seemed pretty cute. A high school girl calling on the ancient Roman gods for help in her love life. And it is mildly cute...but that's about all.  Goode's writing style is annoying. I can't stand writers who feel the need to constantly remind the audience of their characters' appearence, personality, etc. Usually in sentences like "You're a loser," said the dark-haired beauty. And that's just a mild example of what her sentences are like. And her characters are even worse. Stereotyped to the Nth degree, with less personality than lime Jell-o. Laura is unsympathetic as a heroine, Cupidity runs around like she's had too many Pixie Styx...only the gods are mildly amusing.  The plot is ridiculous. Apart from being fairly predictable, so much of it is random and scattered. Loose ends aren't tied up, things happen for no good reason, and Laura has one friend (Ashley) who has a habit of appearing out of thing air. There's little explanation or reasoning behind Laura's realization of who she loves, and she's pretty unconvincing about it anyway.  And for someone who most obviously prides herself on being a mythology buff, Goode seems to have forgotten that the gods have been around a lot longer than 3000 years 
 We bought the bumbo seat for our five month old baby. By her fifth month she fell on her face with it still attached to her bottom. She was hurt pretty bad. No way this seat can keep the baby in place with its own weight.  Please beware of how unsafe this product is. Not at all what is advertised.  
 If you must watch this film, watch it for Winkler, who gives an interesting preview of his future role in "Arrested Development".  Watching this movie for "Prinz" and "Stiles" is counterproductive.  Not only have the actors "failed to make the best" of the script, the script was written from the viewpoint of the super-rich Hollywood elite who live lives with zero financial consequences.  Thus, we watch as young adults walk out on culinary school, muse about becoming "singer-songwriters", and "stop paying attention" to their college plans.  Much like the "Friends" genre that this movie shamelessly imitates, this is a "time porn" piece, where the characters have little else to do besides "mature romantically" and "find themselves".  A movie for history's circular file 
 Well, this game... I mean, this movie is about... there are a group of... sorry. Don't waste your time. Nothing to see. Even my boy, after seen the movie, decided to put the game on the shelf, without finishing it 
 I am completely dissapinted with this book. It is just a one-page introduction to every chapter plus little comments on two or three representative works of each period. Whether you have some knowledge or not on arts, the book is useless 
 Hmmm...I think I missed a whole lot of somethings.  This is a dreadful novel.  I'll admit, I picked it up because the movie is currently in theaters.  I should have known better.  A review of the movie..."...convoluted plot, ambiguous characters, confusing..." should have scared me off.  Each time I picked it up, I had to re-read a few pages, to figure out who was who and what was or wasn't happening.  I tried to finish this book...honest...but, all too soon, it got tossed in the "drop off at the club" pile.  I never even took the time to read the last few chapters to see what happened.  Why?  Because I had no urge to know.    Will I watch the movie?  Well, maybe, because I like the actors...but, only once it's offered, free, on "On Demand."  I've spent enough money on this overly-hyped, drivel of a story 
 I feel that the writing style is a little confusing even though Jensen is a master. I also recommend to integrate the three volumes to one due to the simplicity and vol. 2 just took 182 pages. In addition, the notations  relatively differ from the ones in Peterson's Petri nets 
 I really like Wesley Snipes and I really like action movies. This movie disappointed on both accounts. I had to wonder what Snipes was thinking in doing this film. I still think he is a great actor and could draw people into theaters, so why do a straight-to-video movie. Truthfully I didn't even read the cover before renting it because it was Wesley Snipes but even if I did I would have still rented it.  The movie starts out ok with a really ingenious armored car heist, which of course goes bad and turns into a pretty neat car chase. After that, the movie seems to fizzle out.  There is not much dialogue and I think the writers put more effort into the heist than the rest of the film. The acting is pretty bad all around, although I think Snipes did what he could with what he as given.  The directing is frazzled and just plain weird. I didn't like it much at all. I think the director was trying to add action to the film by his style of directing but to me it just made things worse.  Given the right attention, this movie could have been great but I get the feeling everyone just wanted to get it released as soon as they could. It has potential, but in my opinion, everyone involved in it just fell flat.  I had trouble getting through the whole thing. If you are a die hard Snipes fan then you might want to rent it, but I don't give any guarantees as to whether you will like it or not. It just might be worth renting simply to see the beginning because the heist is definitely one of the most intelligent and ingenious I have ever seen.  Don't expect much and marvel at the heist and you just might not feel like you've wasted your time watching it. Only buy it if you are an avid fan who must have a copy of every movie your favorite actor has made regardless of how good they are 
 Dershowitz is supposed to be a college professor, yet he consistently cuts and pastes sources from Joan Peters fraud, From Time in Memorial.  Norman Finkelstein all proves without any shadow of doubt that this book has manipulated figures from prominent Jewish historian Benny Morris.  Finkelstein debated Dershowitz on Democracy Now about this issue.  Despite Dershowitz's constant interruptions I believe it is the most intertaining debate I have ever seen.  Please download it from Finkelstein's website if you have time.  Dershowitz is just one example of people contributing to the distortion history and creating a fog to the real crisis in Palestine.   
 Not that she writes poorly, but Julia Glass completely failed to captivate me with this book.  It took me three months to finish it (reluctantly), and I didn't understand nor did I like the "design" of this novel...three separate stories, the last of which didn't connect to the first (I was expecting it to all along). To each her own, but I found this book boring and annoying 
 I found this book to be ponderous and, in the end, unreadable.  I gave up on it with only 100 pages left to read - I cared that little about what was going to happen to the characters.  The book is now in the donation bin of my local public library 
 Why oh why haven't Smith and Ragan, experts in instruction, noticed that dry writing is not effective?  Apparently they believe that dry impersonal writing is a model of proper academic voice.  Sure, if the purpose of writing is to ensure that readers disengage as quickly as possible, then the style chosen does a wonderful job.  In addition, the text presumes that its audience are bottom-up learners and short-changes those of us that need a good hard look at the big picture before we can absorb the components thereof.  I can say one good thing about this text; it holds its resale value.  
 The Ant Farm is a wonderful educational toy, but the quality is disappointing as other reviewers have said.  The plastic has rough, unattractive edges from manufacture, and the bottom is not perfectly flat, so it can wobble a little bit.  None of this will matter to my nephews, but certainly the manufacturer should do a better job 
 I never saw this movie until i was 16. The girl i was dating at the time loved this movie. The rocky horror picture show was number one on her list so i tend to compare this one to that one not that the storys are similar in any way. But they do have one thing in common they are both horrible movies. I did give this movie two stars because it had some slightly entertaining moments, well so did fraggle rock! fraggle rock got cancelled for a reason! everyone burn your copies now 
 been using the product for 6 months now - battery time isnt great - I constantly need to recharge the battery.  People always complain of an echo 
 Don't bother.  Characters are lifeless, plot is boring, can't believe her first book is a best seller.  Maybe it was just pure luck 
 Based on lots of great reviews, I decided to buy Kaspersky.  After two months, I got a message saying my activation key was blacklisted.  I sent an email to customer service and got an auto reply saying they were too busy to respond within 48 hours.  Finally after three days someone got back to me and told me to try deleting and reentering the key.  This did not work.  I had to reply again to customer service and got the same auto reply. This time, no one ever replied.  I sent another email threatening to write negative reviews of them and they still, weeks later, have not replied.  I emphatically advise against buying this product.  If you ever have a problem, you will not get help 
 The basic plot was a little incredible - the idea that this junior partner could fake his death and run off with a fortune was somewhat believable, but many of the details are absurd. In fact, the more the story is filled in, the more ridiculous it becomes. Until the last 100 pages or so, it is a fine and entertaining read. It starts to break down at that point, with two revelations near the end that make no sense at all. (No spoilers here; keep reading.)  The first revelation is just absurd - it makes the main character look like a moron. The second revelation, just a few pages from the end of the book, makes a critical character look ridiculous, as well. This latter revelation is not consistent with the rest of the plot or the characters as they have been developed. Worse, it is bad writing. Worst of all, it turns an enjoyable book into a horribly depressing read.  I read the bulk of this book on two plane flights, then stayed up late to finish the last couple of chapters. I ended up falling asleep depressed and resolved never to read another Grisham book; he has let me down too many times, now, and the last thing I want after several hundred pages of fun reading is to have that experience yanked away by a cynical finish 
 The other day I have picked up the latest book by our first Turkish Nobel Laureate in literature, Orhan Pamuk. As far as one could tell, the decision to honor him with the Nobel Prize was largely based on this particular literary accomplishment. At least, when asked by reporters why Pamuk deserved the Prize, Professor Horace Engdahl, the very multilingual Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, kept referring to this book.  The book in question, Istanbul: Memoirs and the City, is a concoction of encyclopedic information, nostalgia-invoking monochrome photographs and the author's unsettling childhood memories. It could very well be crowned his worst work to date by readers familiar with the author's previous books. As I forced myself through page after page of what seems to be Pamuk's much distorted perception of his hometown, I can honestly say that his childhood memories sprinkled here and there were what kept me awake.  Just like in his previous works, a constant undertone of pessimism and hopelessness is palpable throughout the book, but his negativism is more disconcerting this time around as he unsuccessfully tries to ascribe his internal conflicts and his personal darkness to a magnificent town whose wonders never cease to amaze.   Owing to his affluent background and is uber-privileged vantage point, Pamuk's views are so dreadfully skewed that you might start believing him while he wholeheartedly describes the citizens of his version of Istanbul, hovering in a dream-like state of communal melancholy.  His imaginary Istanbul - with its decrepit buildings, filthy streets and rabid dogs roaming its dark, narrow, and decaying alleys - is not the vibrant city throbbing with liveliness that the ordinary folks, like his readers or the lower class Istanbullus for that matter, are able to perceive. His repeated use of the adjective dilapidated to describe certain aspects of Istanbul feels deliberate and malevolent.  As he paints this almost repulsive picture of Istanbul, he does not fail to rebut disagreeing views of European Istanbul lovers by telling them, "You need to live here at least ten years to be able to see it through my eyes."   Who are you to know what you are seeing?  Pamuk sees Istanbul as a fallen fantasy town where he is entitled to scorn poverty and the impoverished which uglifies what is rightfully his. He is visibly and unashamedly tormented as this city, for which he fosters a pathological affection, ignores his irrational expectations of conformity altogether. She continues to pulsate, breathe and change, remains jovial and full of energy, determined to enjoy whatever life throws at her as Pamuk watches from the sidelines in anguish.  Most disturbing of it all is his suggestion, maybe not directly but most certainly inferentially, that Istanbullus have no fight left in them. They have already lost the game and have made peace with the fact - hence comes the hï¿½zï¿½n a term he is trying a little too hard to coin - and are desperately waiting for the shoe to drop. (Hey, why not generalize this to the entire country while we are at it and reinforce the whole Sick-Man-of-Europe deal?) Pamuk's yearning for all things European and his dislike for whatever may represent the east is even more pronounced in parts of the book where he professes his love to Istanbul.  It is fair to say that Pamuk's work brought him very little acclaim in Turkish literature, and few if no awards. His writing skills have always been an issue of debate among his colleagues. Nowadays, there is a lot of discussion in Turkey about how his literary inelegance is magically lost in translation, how his sentences are invigorated and become more passable with some creative interpretation from his talented translator Melling Freely, as well as many proven accusations of plagiarism.  Until recently, Pamuk has been known to steer clear of politics. He has spent most of his career carefully avoiding political subjects, or approaching them only tangentially, with the calculated caution and slickness expected from bourgeoisie intelligentsia.   His abrupt and seemingly unnatural politicization began with Snow, his most politically-charged novel to date. His loving embrace of "all things political", unforeseeable as it was, tightened up faster than expected, reaching its peak with his astounding public statements regarding the killing of one-and-a-half million Armenians and thirty-thousand Kurds. This incarnation of Pamuk even claimed that he was the only person in Turkey who had enough cojones to broach these sensitive issues. Why the sudden change, you might ask yourself. I did ask myself, for one thing, why did the vanilla boy become interested in politics in his fifties?   All the publicity and buzz surrounding this "new and improved" Pamuk must have sounded like music to Pamuk's mostly English speaking allies and co-workers, who have done more than their share of P.R. for Pamuk's continued existence in European and American literary circles. These selfless allies have gone so far out of their way to promote this one specific author in such unprecedented fashion that it makes one wonder why.  Measly commissions they were to get from the marketing of Pamuk's books were so out of proportion with the amount of effort they put into hyping Pamuk to literary stratosphere that you have to ask why?  Did the promoters of Pamuk have an ulterior motive? Was the French Parliament's passing of the bill that criminalizes "questioning of armenian genocide" just when Pamuk's received his award a coincidence? Is European Union, which harbors this primordial mentality that does not stop at telling you what you can or cannot say but goes a step further and dictates what you can and cannot question, worth joining? Did people around Pamuk lure him into doing things that he might not have done otherwise by using the brilliant Nobel Prize as bait?  Was it worth it?  Reportedly, Pamuk's editor at Random House, George Andreou said in an interview in 2001, that if Pamuk were to write more politically he would have won a Nobel Prize by then.   This statement answered at least some of my questions 
 Unfortunately the author did not get the basic premise correct. Ukraine does not mean borderland. The oldest use of the word found in written text is in the 10th century chronicle of Slava o Polke Ihoria. The term Ukraine is used as meaning within the kingdom, at the heart of the kingdom. The opposite of what the author writes. Borderland would mean Okraina, this is the difference between in and out. She also missed that Ukraine has the oldest calendar on the planet now dating to 7039. Another significant fact.  Maybe the next book could be an new history based on  archives from Lutsk and Kyiv that the author did not read. Missing such a basic premise clouds the rest of the book 
 This book was as disappointing as the author's other books I have tried to read. I seem to be continuously fooled by what these books seem to be, or what they cold have been, and am brought up short by what they actually are. In this case, a pedantic jaunt through junk e-mail type one-liners. I hold a college degree, studied English and creative writing, and am not illiterate, as another reviewer claims those who dislike this book must be. Perhaps my expectations are too high...a book should be entertaining 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 I was shocked by most of the questions.  For example: If you had to watch your lover or spouse have sex with someone else, but could determine who it would be, who would you choose?  If you could have sex with one pagan god, which would it be?  I don't consider myself a prude by any means but I feel this book is immoral and dangerous to anyone in a monogamous relationship.  I returned it! 
 this movie was terrible....I went into the theater skepical because I heard that the screenwriters were untested...well, this disastorpiece is what you get as a result. The movie did so poorly that it bankrupted Square Pictures.   The dialouge was filled with one liners, wasted several talented actors like Donald Sutherland. The drama seemed artificial, and the story was just bad. What I did like about this movie is that it showed that adult-oriented computer animated productions are possible instead of the childrens movies by Pixar (Monsters Inc....which was actually FAR BETTER than this)  This movie is just bad....avoid it...I want to see them make a movie out of Final Fantasy 6, which was the best of the series in my opinio 
 The Cobra Event is a jarring book, not because of the plausibility of the plot nor because it goes into excruciating pains to describe dead boies and their subsequent autopsies, but because there are so many errors on its pages. Worse, there are whole chapters devoted to nothing that advances the plot or helps me undersatand the story better; pages and pages of filler - it was like reading a doughnut.  Among the worst are:  --Changing verb tenses in the middle of a paragraph. I have no idea why a paragraph that starts with the past perfect tense suddenly switches to the present tense in the second sentence. And it didn't happen just once.  --Using "you" all the time. The book has this very condescending, accusatory tone when it directly addresses me, as though it knows what I know and don't know.  --Maxing out the filler potential. I know that detail helps to make stories seem authentic, but really, taking a paragraph to explain the history of Katz's Delicatessan is superfluous.  Argh 
 I find it pretty shameful that after all that "evidences" of WMD in Iraq and sham of US and UK intelligence agencies, some politicians still want to make a fool out of public, pushing their rubbish down people's throat; so, No thank you !!! I'm already full from Iraq.  http://www.pnionline.com/dnblog/attytood/archives/001988.html  Iranian VEVAK has already ridiculed West's intelligence agencies through the so called "visionary" politicians and their credible   channels enough; let's just for once leave CIA do its job properly without Alis or Chalabis 
 As another reviewer says:  "But the final tax forms I needed to file with were not included on the CD-ROM package. TurboTax instructed me to get them by using "one-click update." Well after I update and attempt to restart the software, TurboTax refuses to come up at all."  Exactly. I've re-installed it over and over and the same thing happens. I've used Turbotax in previous years and never had a problem like this. After spending hours entering in my data, there is apparently no way to get to the final filing stage. With four days before the due date, this is disasterous. Their support site offers no hint of a fix. Mac users, stay away 
 Let's keep this simple. Lyra is a well-drawn charming character. She is also a weapon in Pullman's battle with the late C.S Lewis ("Chronicles of Narnia"). Pullman is an atheist and a revered member of the Brit chattering class. He has called his manichean view of religion--evil, evil, evil--"an artistic flaw." Yep, you bet. About halfway through the first book my stomach began to hurt, as if I had swallowed something rotten (and I am not terribly religious).  So, parents, there you have it. If you are atheists, this book is just the ticket. It, however, needs a PG-13 label. Young kids will certainly have nightmares. It is scary-gruesome. I wonder if Nicole Kidman (cast as the icky lay church official) will actually break the good witch's fingers or will the director skip that part?  Heretical positive comparisons with Tolkien aside, if you have even the slightest belief in a higher power or don't want to scare your kids half to death, I suggest you give Pullman's propaganda a pass. When an author's primary goal is to kill God (Pullman succeeds), he clearly has issues. Don't make them your ow 
 First they started out as nu-metal, then they moved onto metalcore, and now psuedo-death metal. It should be no surprise to the fools who listen to this garbage that they are clearly following trends, and after each trend dies, they just move on to another one. If my calculations are correct, expect a psuedo-black metal release.  But, what about the musicians? Sure, they have a fast drummer...who likes to trigger alot, then they have two guitarists...who like to steal Pantera riffs, and then they have the singer, who, well, sounds just like all the rest. Atleast they dont have the DJ anymore (oh wait, they do, nevermind.)  Enough of my rambling, how does this untalented group of posers fair up? Well, image if Mushroomhead went metalcore. 'Nuff said.  Avoid 
 Stopped reading it halfway.  I just found the whole premise, and the author's attempt to create a dramatic context, half-baked.  This struck me as a book churned out in a hurry to meet some quota.  Save your money.. 
 I loved the Happy Hooker by Deb Stoller and so was excited when I heard about this book.  I was looking for a nice collection of various patterns.  What a disappointment.  The book was cheaply done with only a middle section of glossies of some rather ugly patterns.  There were a couple of nice things, but nothing like Deb Stoller's much nicer book.  I had heard there were to be 40 projects, but it seems like a lot less.  I didn't like the models of the projects either, for they seemed to be striving toward sexy and Now.  But most looked like hookers.  Even the wonderful Pea Coat was not shown to advantage.  Very unhappy with this poorly done book 
 This is to show my appreciation for the excellent reviews of Alyssa A. Lappen on matters relating to Muslim theology and the Israeli-Arab conflict.  With the current review of Omid Safi's book, she again hits the nail right on its head.  The one star rating in this review is my rating of Mr. Safi's book, not Ms Lappen's reviews.  Ms Lappen's reviews deserve a rating of 5 stars or better 
 I read this book for school, and  we went over all the good points of this book and its literary merit, etc.  The writing style is smooth and descriptive, but I find the plot dull and trite.  She is a teen searching for love and her voice, and the story is her traveling from husband to husband and her not being satisfied.  The idea of her finding her voice is inconsistent and unfounded.  If you want to read a book about a silly girl who doesn't know what to do with herself, and if you want to be bombarded with overused symbolism, be my guest and read "Their Eyes Were Watching God" by Zora Neale Hurston.  Only read it if you are looking at the writing style, do not read it for the plot. 
 I was hoping this would be a fairly accurate way to measure my body fat percentage.  The instructions on how to pinch and measure fat are inadequate.  The pictures are lousy and leave you with no idea of where or how you're supposed to pinch.  I get different results every time I take a measurement.  Not very effective 
 THIS FILM HAD  POTENTIAL TO DELIVER BUT IT IS NOT WORTH BUYING. RENT OR BUY FOR MY TWO .02 CENTS 
 I almost gave up on this book after the first chapter featured several paragraph-long run on sentences with no punctuation. I was determined to try though. Once I got used to the almost non-existent editing I was able to enjoy the story. It is a challenge, but the reward is an interesting glimpse of the cowboy life. I'm not sure the effort was worth it, though. Note to writers--employ editors so that your story isn't lost due to hard to read prose! It added nothing to the book to create a new "style" and made reading very cumbersome and frustrating. This is one of the few times that I wish I had just watched the movie instead 
 I saw a bit of an interview with the author on Book TV and got this. I really WANTED to like this book. The (stated) premise of the book is strong, and bringing Epaminondas's exploits to a wide audience seemed pretty interesting to me.  My problem was that right from the get-go it seemed to me the author had a pretty weird tendency to draw political parallels between ancient Greece and today which just aren't appropriate or realistic. They weren't key to what he was trying to say, either, so I probably could have soldiered through the book. I put it down, though, since it was distracting trying to figure out where he was really coming from.   I admit that his dismissiveness toward Alexander and Grant seemed borderline childish to me, the way it was written. Perhaps that also made it hard for me to take the good parts of the book seriously 
 I can't imagine how many hours of my life I wasted worrying about ego-trippin' jocks. Although, I understand how I got hooked on this bad habit.  The rich folk who own our media do a great job of marketing this endless diversion to the masses.  So, instead of worrying about economic justice, environmental destruction, the well-being of children and so forth; the passion of a large segment of the general public is frittered away on watching one city's gladiators combat another city's gladiators. On top of that, with the us vs. them pattern of thinking that is encouraged, the anthem singing, and so many pro sports figures involved with right-wing politics (Bernie Kosar, John Elway, Steve Largent), I've come to realize how poltically-charged this so called "escape" actually is.  On top of that, I just got sick of all these sports announcers barking about this or that, wagging their finger in my face.  The ads in Sports Illustrated are also a bunch of macho [...].  By the way, before he was killed by "friendly fire," Pat Tillman was reading Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn books.  In fact, he had arranged to have a meeting with Chomsky after he returned from our war of terror.  Too bad he wasn't able to pursue that path.  My interest in sports is now limited to badminton in my backyard, and books like "What's My Name Fool?" which is about how sports figures sometimes remember issues like peace and justice 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 We ordered this book on the good reputation of the author, but were very disappointed in the author's portrayal of witches.  We are unable to use this book in our schools 
 ok i love action films except this one...  the previews fooled me really badly, i thought jet li would somehow take down all the arrows like how the previews showed it...but no, he dies. that is a tragedy. if ur marketing a film and setting an expectation, make sure u meet it otherwise people get angry, like me 
 I admit that I'm addicted - despite the s.l.o.w. progress, constant female bickering, and frequent fashion details.  I want to see how this dang series ends...will it?    This particular installment of the Dragon et. al. left me feeling underwhelmed.  The ending was a disappointment, but I'll press on and order book 8.  
      First, I should remind you, Dear Reader, that since italics, boldface type, and underlines can't be used in these kind of reviews, I have to use one capital letter in some mid-sentence words to slightly stress them and use all capitals to stress other words even more!       Anyway, one star on this review is one star too many to give this album and band.       I received this album as a gift for my birthday while I was on the other side of the country.  I'd never even Heard of this band until then, much less any of their songs by pure and simple osmosis.  When I finally got around to taking it out of the wrapping and putting it into the CD player of my car on the way to work and back, I was not impressed with the opening song, nor the second, nor the third, etcetera, and so on, and so forth ...       I kept wondering if this coma-inducing drone (interrupted only by the screaming of the word "Nothing" at least 20 times at the end of the first song) was some kind of tactical build-up by the band so they could eventually break out a song that made them at least Somewhat Big (much less a hit) to start the party.        You know the kind of song I mean, don't you, Dear Reader?  I mean the kind of song that makes you think "Whoa!  Who's THIS?!" because it has a either a great opening, or a great first line or four, or at least Something to grab your attention within the first minute, like Ani DiFranco's song "Out of Range" would do in less than 16 seconds.       Anyway, MANY extremely torturous minutes later, the 9th song came along (ironically for me, it's called "Wishful Thinking") and I honestly couldn't take anymore of this DRIVEL!  I gave this band A Whole NINE TRIES to make something that at least Resembles an impression and all I got was only Slightly less musical boredom as when I did when I once tried to listen to the only bad album I currently know by Tangerine Dream: "ZEIT".  That album, by the way, was basically four 20-minute bits of what seemed like people in an orchestra tuning up their instruments and eventually matching one single note with each other BEFORE the conductor starts a symphony you never get to hear.      As I said, this album is only a micrometer less boring.       I honestly cannot understand how anyone who scouts for the music industry could have happened along this sorry excuse for a band and thought to themselves "WOW!  These guys are On FIRE!  I must get them to the studio and P.R. them IMMEDIATELY!!"       Let me put it this way, Dear Reader: Remember that song "Next Time I Fall In Love" by Peter Cetera and Amy Grant back in the mid to late 1980's?  In comparison to the so-called songs on this album, that cutesy ballad will sound more intense and energetic than "Paranoid" by Black Sabbath.      Maybe Wilco got their record contract by winning a contest of who could bore an audience the quickest.       Oh, and if you're wondering to yourself, "Oh yeah? Well,  let's see this guy (as in ME) make a Better album!"        I already Have made a better album and I'll gladly show it to you.  Leave me a response to this review if you want that proof.  AAAaaannnnnd ... CUT! That's a wrap 
 I think I'm done with the Mrs. Murphy books.  This one was so bad I couldn't even finish it.  I actually threw it away.  It's time for the author to move on.  These characters have become downright boring 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 I had to read this book for my graduate class in religious theory.  This book not only made idea of ritual more confusing but I think completly lost.  Bell brings together some important theorists of our time into a compilation of blahhhh.  For someone who is intersted in the study of Rituals I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS BOOK!!!  Her language is awkward and so is the feel 
 ...but I really hate the soprano sax played over these beautiful pieces.  The singing is superb and the repertoire is rare (only one other recording of the Morales, for instance, and that is done quite differently, anent the sax).  I think I would have liked it better if Garbarak had played a lower horn, like an alto or tenor sax.  These pieces are about something, and I don't feel that Gabarak really knew what the texts were about and what the composers were responding to in the texts.  I keep it for the exquisite "Parce mihi Domine" sung withoug the screeching sax 
 I read this book and couldn't believe that it would have actually been published. I *AM* a woman and the author has NO idea what it means to be a woman except what he experienced during the 6 weeks he lived as one. The way the book is put together is like someone who waited till the night before and tried to do a term paper. It was as if all of his thoughts were just "thrown together" and it was hard to follow at times. In his *Epilogue* he said that "Gender is due to social Interaction*. Excuse me sir, BUT *GENDER* DOES NOT have anything to DO with "Social Interaction. *Gender* is what someone IS on the *inside* NOT on the outside or how they are perceived by others in society. This book was a waste of time AND money!!!! 
 I expected so much more from Terry.  This book was too boring for words!  Don't waste your money.  She is too talented to put something like this out there.  
 ok, I've only just seen this film for the first time, so it's hard to really judge the social impact it had 13 years ago and its importance in that respect, but this is not a particularly good film.  I mean, it has its choice moments where it really comes together. the shot of caine downing a 40 in the korean grocers is imaginitively directed. any scene with o-dog is almost guaranteed classic status. samuel jackson's in it. and if you're a fan of dave chapelle's tyrone biggums crackhead character, the token crackhead in this film is worth a few laughs for his to-the-tee similarity.  but that's really my problem with this film. serious issues are reduced to a series of ham-fisted archetypes straight out of central casting. and they're ALL here: the homey black grandparents, the nation of islam convert, the socially conscious mother whose son is starting to go down caine's road... all characters that might fare better in a different film that treats these issues with more subtlety and depth.  take the french film 'la haine', for instance. it clearly took a lot of inspiration from menace 2 society, boyz n tha hood, etc., but its characters actually feel tormented, instead of just having lots of scenes written FOR them to show their torment. rather than just running through a laundry list of problems, one-by-one, scene-by-scene, it really gets to the heart of something bigger, some grander alienation that urban youths feel, which is what menace 2 society would like to be able to do. plus, if you can believe it, the hip-hop in 'la haine' is quite a bit better.  so while I would definitely recommend seeing this film, keep the remote aimed and ready, finger on the fast-forward button. maybe about a half-hour of this film is really worth watching, whereas the other 70 minutes are mostly just dull moralising. oh yeah, and there's a really embarrassing-to-watch sex scene thrown in for no particular reason. oh, also, the filmmakers apparently think people who have just been shot look like they are being electrocuted while spitting out cherry slurpees. in a film that didn't try to carry so much social weight, that kind of thing would be ok because you could laugh it off as bad filmmaking, but it really just cheapens this one 
 After owning three other Canon cameras I am through with Canon. All my other cameras were fine. This cameras LCD broke within the first month of normal use. Never dropped! All of my other Digital cameras held up for years. Ive had two powershot s50s 1 lost and 1 stolen. Never had a problem and those were both dropped numbers of times.  This is a product defect/design flaw and Canon will not cover it under warranty. $150.00 to get it repaired and It will happen again, or you may start getting the E18 errors. This is a expensive paperweight!  Poor design. Very dissapointed. I will never buy another Canon product again 
 There are many ideas for quilt blocks in this book, and most of them are very... cute, but not in a good way.  I personally don't like making blocks that are cats or dogs.  This would be an excellent book for an older quilter who does things the old way, but if you are young and want something fresh and fun, try out Black Mountain Quilts, Cotton Way, or Kim Diehl.  
 Crudely written. A negative hero deserves better and Wharton has written some fine books. Sadly, not this one. 
 De Soto fundamentally argues that the reason poor countries are poor is because they have bad property rights: it's incredibly difficult for poor people (specifically, recent urban migrants) to get legal title to their land. As a result, the poor make "extralegal" arrangements, squatting on and using land that neighbors (but not the government) recognize as theirs. But because they don't own the land, they can't get a mortgage on their house to start a business, electricity and water companies are less likely to reliably provide services, the government has difficulty taxing them because they don't have a legal address, and so on. And so on.  It's a very important point but de Soto oversells, arguing with exaggerated (and oft-repeated) ideological claims but weak empirical evidence that solving this problem will actually enrich the poor.   He occasionally shares insights from his interesting field work. For example, he has helped businesses in Peru to navigate the overwhelming bureaucracy and become legal, and he has found that most businesses would rather be legal and pay taxes than be illegal and pay bribes: a useful bit of empirical information, but those gems appear all too occasionally.  Before reading this entire book, I recommend going to the website of de Soto's foundation (the Institute for Liberty and Democracy at www.ild.org.pe) and reading the main point there (in one tenth the words) 
 I would like to thank everyone who has left a bad review for this book. It's no wonder so many people are suffering within the Church. This is one of the worst books ever written 
 Let me start by saying that this is the only Dirk Pitt/Clive Cussler novel I've read so far. I have no opinion on any other DP books. This, however, was dreadful.  This book's only redeeming point is the seemingly interesting theory about the Trojan Oddyssey having taken place in the Atlantic  Ocean instead of the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, this theory has preciously little to do with the rest of the book, and seems to be there mainly as a selling point for a mostly unrelated (and very poor) story.  The actual story is best compared to a bad James Bond movie (one from the seventies would do nicely), complete with super-villains, world-threatening schemes and secret bases. The problem here is that all of this is completely silly from start to finish (what on earth was up with the hologram pirates?). Everything is far-fetched, implausible, or most likely both. It also has none of the style and very little of the humor which often redeems James Bond.   To make matters even worse, this movie must contain the worst characters in living history. From Dirk Pitt to the super-villain, they're all extremely dull and flat. Yet, no opportunity is wasted by the author to rub in how wonderful, beautiful and talented all these characters (supposedly) are. Together with lots of unnecessarily lengthy descriptions of just about everything, this book is truly full of filler.   The characters are also completely super-human, apparently, since there doesn't seem to be anything that Pitt cum suis can't handle, including flying a helicopter into the hurricane of the century (just after the hurricane nearly took out a much more sturdy plane) and much more. This takes away any form of suspension there could have been.   If this book didn't take itself so seriously, it might have worked. As it is, though, "Trojan Odyssey" is a totally daft, horribly written excuse for a book that does almost nothing with a potentially very entertaining theory 
 This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie of all time, and unfortunately I was trying to save a few dollars by buying the cheaper one, big mistake!  This thing will hardly play at all, very poor quality image.  It is not worth the disk it's on.  Now I have to get the remastered one anyway, sigh.  Lesson learned 
 I now own 3 of Mr. Tomosy's books and they are only modestly useful. This one misses by about a mile.   To some people this book will seem over their heads, a bit too technical and hard to comprehend. Aimed perhaps at camera repair professionals.  Actually, it doesn't suit either the person who wants to make a small repair or someone who wants to make a more technical repair. There's not a word there on how to replace the shutter or any number of things that many reasonably competent DIY do every day. It's not something I would do on just any camera. My M series are treated with care and professionally serviced. There are repairs that are beyond either my ability or willingness to spend the time and those go out.   But it helps to have good clear instruction. Shocking as it seems, just taking something apart and putting it together again can allow a simple repair. As one reviewer notes, there is better information out there for specialist groups/forums. After buying this I received a detailed service manual for my IIIf screwmount Leicas. In the same way, I have acquired fairly complete service manuals or instructions from those willing to share on   Soviet made imitations of Leicas (which are good for practice and confidence building).  Cameras are a bit like a mix of car mechanics and working on watches. But to use the car analogy, the Chiltonor Haynes type manuals sometimes fall a bit shy in the detailed information you need by covering too many years, but they're adequate. On the other hand, there are the full blown shop manuals for a specific model vehicle.  Also useful (drive a Detroit truck occasionally  and you'll know why).   This Repair handbook doesn't really come close to the skimpiest Chilton type book. It may be asking too much to cover both M series and Screwmount in one book, but the title is a misnomer. It is not really a repair handbook 
 With a title suggesting strong emotions, hard questions put and harder answers given, I was intrigued by the idea of an American author attempting to describe and interpret non-American views of the U.S.A.; an awareness and understanding of non-American viewpoints evidently a major failing of Americans at present.  Unfortunately, foreign perceptions of the U.S.A are only the ostensible subject of this volume; we see very little of the opinions of Hertsgaard's interlocutors and too much of Hertsgaard's own, rather commonplace, views.  With this mundane work, Hertsgaard merely perpetuates a perception that Americans, 'liberal' or not, are solipsistic, trite, and sublimely indifferent to the views of the foreigners whose lives are so affected, unwillingly or not, by American global political, social and corporate adventurism.    So, for this reader, no fascination and no fury, but as one feels with so many American products, just contemptuous amusement and weary disappointment.  
 I have ordered the items twice and still have not received it by now, because your shipping department have problem to provide the correct mailing address to DHL. 
 I've purchased this sauce at a retail bakery and it was fabulous.  I've ordered it several times here and it NEVER arrives usable.  Jars are always smashed.  Guess I'll have to continue to buy it at a store.  Very dissappointed!! 
 I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.   For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.   Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.   The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.  However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.   In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now! 
 This art instruction manual is aptly titled as it is about "survival", offering hassle-free recipe- driven art projects for masses of students.  If you were a public school student in the last 40 years the projects will look depressingly familiar--the obligatory construction paper  mask, the linoleum block print, the paper mache' animal.  What is lacking is an overriding vision of what students may achieve.  The "goals" are largely stated by listing vocabulary words but the opportunities for real discovery are thin indeed.  As an art  teacher of 20 years, I would never rely on construction paper for collage as it is impossible to produce anything with richness from such flat uninteresting papers.  The student block print examples show the medium at its least interesting with the images mostly being reverse outline, little exploration of shape or figure-ground reversal.  Moreover, it is criminal that a book purporting to be about the development of the visual sense should have reproductions of such appalling quality.  Some of them are clearly printing errors since all one can see are dark gray rectangles with a few hints of light.  The student examples were grim and to me this is the book's greatest failing.  The strength of an art instruction book to me usually lies in the student examples.  Mona Brooks and Kaupelis (first name escapes me) produce inspiring books on the basis of their student work alone.  On a positive note, the book is well- organized.  It could possibly serve as a jumping off point to a teacher with experience and initiative, but for the most part it perpetuates the predictable, mind-numbing experience of the all-too typical  30 minute public school art block 
 Easy set up.  Simply does NOT work.  I have no IR or RF interference and I set up to debug by puting the transmitter in the adjacent room and placing the receiver directly in front of the unobstructed units 8 feet away.  Cannot get any device to work through this transmitter.  If I make 20 keystrokes, ONE will get transmitted successfully.  Great concept.  Really poorly engineered 
 Save your money!  I have sat through some terrible movies, but this one takes the cake.  There is no plot.  It is a below-low budget movie that looks as if it was recorded on a cell phone.  The character on the movie basically repeats the exact same thing with three or four different victims, and the whole time we are subjected to slaughterhouse footage.  There is no way to really even know what is being done in the scene at hand.  Even the Henry movie, and Dahmer look like 5 star movies compared to this one.  
 I thought that this book in addition to description of the work and life onboard provides detailed information on how to write a cover letter and resume as well as to pass an interview. Unfortunately all I found about this were 3 pages with common sense tips. I think that instead of having 15 caricatures and funny pictures long 1/2-1 page the author had to provide detailed information on these 3 crucial for successful applying topics. That's why if you really want to get a cruise ship job search for another book. 
 I have read over a dozen instructional books on racing, and this is easily the worst.  It doesn't ever get specific enough about the lessons it tries to teach, and even though I was familiar with every subject it covered, I was still confused by some of their descriptions.  I believe an experienced and educated racer will find this book too elementary, and the beginning racer won't understand that they aren't being taught the whole lesson, and their driving will suffer.  Start with Watts' "Secrets of Solo Racing", which has very relevant and helpful diagrams (unlike this book) and go from there.  You will be a better driver for it.   
 ...because I thought White Oleandar was brilliant. But this book? Not so much. I would not be surprised if Paint it Black were something Fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. It felt much less fully realized. I found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. I generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. The whole book was written in one note, so I, too, agree with the "flat" description. I found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. I absolutely savored every word of Fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it. 
 I actually only read this book because my daughter came home from school claiming that her teacher told her Jesus was the reason that we have candy canes. Apparently, to my extreme dismay, the public school system thought it would be a good idea to read this story a group of first and second graders. No disclaimer was read to them or anything, and my daughter was convinced that this story was definite fact because her teacher said so,  and I had to sit down with her and explain that this story did not have any real connection to fact and show her information that showed exactly where the candy cane came from, and prove that it did not have a religious background at all. I plan to speak with my daughter's teachers and find out why such religious propoganda is being read to my child in an educational environment, but I wanted to make sure that I also posted a review online. Sure the story seems cute, but a very young girl, alone with a stranger, distributing candy in the name of religion, is just not my idea of what I want my daughter to hear about. I would prefer if this type of sharing was kept to people's homes and not distributed in my daughter's school. As we are not Christian, it is hard enough to try to teach my daughter about our own traditions without adding the confusion of a teacher telling her otherwise. THIS BOOK SHOULD NOT BE READ TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL CLAS 
 I was forced to read this drivel for a graduate photo program. God I wanted to kill myself and quit photography by the time I was finished with it. If you want to read great photographic essays try Bill Jay's work. Amazing, insightful and filled with a sense of humor 
 It should have been titled, Making the Most of Harvard: Students Speak Their Minds.  We were required to read this book for an English writing class.  Some of the suggestions in the book are helpful, like time management and getting help if you are not scoring well but only if you read this book *before* you go to college.    Light makes suggestions that may not be feasable, including finding a class with very few students because it will be benificial.  Our class also felt that Light's suggestion of picking roomates according to race is ludicrous.  
 The first 80 pages are boring. The first chapter is cryptic--a feeble attenpt at creating a story hook. I don't know how this book got through an editor. Wait, it didn't. Sometimes its about who you know, not about your abilities as a writer. Makes sense, otherwise this book would never get published 
 This book would make a good school book to show kids the basics of electrical circuits.  It unfortunately is based on obsolete technology for the hydronic controls and has no controls for heat pumps. It's based around boilers etc. 
 Good for a few weeks. Now it starts to make loud girdling noises. Now the water seems to SLOWLY leak. Water ran well when I first got it but after a few weeks (3 weeks) the water seems to stop running (now only leaking drip by drip). The girdling sound is so loud that it scares my cat. I put enough water in this thing but I really do not know why the machine is not pump smoothly and powerfully even at max setting. Waste of money 
 Prospective readers should be aware that this book promotes the long-discredited psychoanalytic view of autism as an emotional disturbance. Full of bizarre interpretations which have remarkably little to do with the subjective experience of autism as described in first-person accounts such as those by Temple Grandin. Interesting enough in its way, but nothing to do with autism 
 This is one of the worst movies ever!!! It is so formulaic and boring. I can't believe the other comments recommending this movie. Dean Cain has NO charisma. I couldn't have cared what happened to him. If you want to see a real movie, get Layer Cake!! 
 You want to learn about Evel Knievel but you don't with this film. Awful. 
 While some of the stories in this collection may be inspiring it points out several things.  Aspiring yuppies have lost the core of Buddha's teachings.  The author feels that if you are not college educated or a monk/child of monks/hippies that you have nothing to offer and your views don't count.  This book presents an unrealistic view of Buddhists with its failure to present a realistic cross section of peoples.    I could easily go out and collect stories of "new agers" uneducated or not and their thoughts on Buddhism and it would most likely drip with the same inaccuracies of what Buddhism means as this book.  I understand that "Buddhism means different things to different people".  What the author does not understand is "DIFFERENT PEOPLE" and "BUDDHISM".  All the people who contributed are little clones of one another in sooo many aspects and no matter what you *think* Buddhism means - THERE IS A COMMON GROUND among ALL Buddhist - which many of the contributors do NOT share.  Thus I would NOT even consider them Buddhists at all.  Just yuppies into "new age" bunk.  If you get into new age psycobabble and mommy and daddy have a lot of money, or you were raised around monks and get into new age psycobabble you will probably enjoy this collection.  
 who needs dark side of the moon? wish you were here? the wall? animals?!?!?   just stick with post 83 floy 
 Ms. McNaught is a fantastic fictional novelist.  It is hard to find any other writer in this genre who has created so many memorable stories and characters.  I can read her books over and over and never grow tired of the material.  But, this book is lacking her "magical touch".  It is not her best work.  It has more filler than story line and will not end up on my bookshelves.  If you love her work and must read this book than get it at the library.  Some of her best titles includethe following:Paradise,  Double Standard, Until You, Once and Always, Something Wonderful, Kindom of Dreams and Night Whispers.  Read these first and you won't be disappointed 
 I am not too impressed with this book, nor its author, Donald Oliver, with whom I had the "priviledge" of taking a series of his classes.  His book, and consequently, his methods, are far too rigid; the guidelines in the book are presented to the reader as if they are the ONLY way to do an audition, and if you don't do it HIS way, you are wrong.  He even provides a list of songs NOT to sing.  However, I believe that a successful audition is not about following a set of rules, but rather what works for each actor.  A song might be overdone, but if one can do it, and do it well, then, by all means, do the song.  Additionally, Donald Oliver is a pompous, arrogent man, who "name drops" to try to impress his students, and believes that his way is the only way.  Do not buy into the "rules" of this book.  If you must read this book, only use it as a reference.  I recommed the book "NEXT" by Steven M. Alper instead 
 No, Ayn Rand was not perfect, but this film is nothing but a smear job. If you want a better sense of what the woman was about, try the 1998 documentary "Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life" or read any of her books. The fact that she was a WOMAN has a great deal to do with the hostility towards her exemplified by slanderous defamations like this movie. Yes "Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life" was written and directed by people who actually like what Ayn Rand had to say. So what! It is far more "fair" then this shrill piece of propaganda 
 I found this book to be very theoretical and not practical at all.  Save your money 
 I found that Mr. Price spent more time on tactics and the aircraft itself than the pilots that flew it to 5 victories. I must admit I'm a bit bias having read Mr. Weal's BF109D/E aces book beforehand and was therefore hoping Mr. Price's book would follow the same writing style. I was disappointed. There had to be more than the 10 pilots Mr. Price focused on that achieved 5 victories in this marque of Spitfire 
 Long time fan, but didn't get much out of this one.  Stories were cute.  Didn't finish it, not worth more time 
 The only reason I made it through this book is because it was our book club choice for the month.  Otherwise, I would have quit after the first chapter.  I found the girl's thought patterns unrealistic for a girl of 11.  The plot of story develpment was very weak, it didn't ripen until the very last few chapters.  By that time, I was so sick of the repetitious story line, I skimmed through it just so I could finish it.  The language was very rich and descriptive, but with such a boring story line, who cares?  I'm glad to be done with it!  
 I have been trading professionally for over 10 years.  I have done very well in the markets after a long learning curve.  The ideas in this book have a slight chance to work, but you'd be better off fliping a coin than  using his entry methods.  I was on the floor and everyone knows about these  ideas. Everything in here needs a tight stop 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 What makes a great novel? A combination of factors, no doubt. Complex characters, a central conflict that develops into a grand theme. Great command of language and imagery. If by these standards, Lord Jim is a great novel, then why is it so revolting? Why do I hate this book more than any other that I've read? It's even worse than the pathetic Madame Bovary, which was on top of my list of the worst books ever written. It's because it has no sense of story. This is the one other factor that makes a great novel, and this is the one that sets apart the "Conrads" from the "Dickenses" of the world. Conrad has the ability to take a moment in time and stretch it out into what seems like a day, and to me, this tedious, hair-splitting approach to interpretation of feelings, motives and gestures clogs the story hopelessly and destroys any sense of timing and pacing. And what after all is reading all about? You can condense the moral truths in a book into a paragraph and save a lot of time, but what makes any book enjoyable is a well told story. This one is not 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 A very sad and depressing book about an unhappy teenager.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you like feeling worse than before you started reading 
 My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.   The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.  That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.   And  no, I do not believe there was any such child. 
 This is a good primer for someone very new to the game. I would suggest Handicapping 101 by Brad Free as a better choice. I expected a bit better from Mr. Eng as he is certainly a respected and knowledgable handicapper. He may have been limited by the publisher 
 Much of what is in this book is not particularly original. Every book on the market in reference to Disney Parks offers a much better summary.  I used this book on a recent trip to DisneyWorld and didn't find it useful 
 Replaced first spindle and still junk. Will always stick with Verbatim from now on 
 This DVD is junk. The instructor is an uptight, vest wearing, theory-spouting, crap artist cum music nerd. He wears his bass way too high (at nipple level, with his little beer gut peering out underneath his bass - very cute if you like oafish men, but otherwise he just looks idiotic). This is a sure sign of a sad, uncool player who couldn't make it as a rockstar, so he became a nerd instead. Trying to slap with your whole forearm is completely stupid. Don't think from what I wrote that I dumped this DVD straight off, I gave it a few weeks to grow on me, but playing like this fool is just so damn uncomfortable and I find him so painfully annoying to watch and listen to.  If you are a music nerd and you have good money to throw after bad, then buy this DVD. If you want to learn to play slap, watch Flea's Adventures in Spontaneous Jamming and Technique for some inspiration (ie. the very basics) and then play your arm off until you figure it out yourself, you'll be better off. The money you save from not buying this DVD is better spent on your next set of strings 
 The theme is interesting enough - an American inmate of a British lunatic asylum contributes much to the creation of OED.  Unfortunately the book doesn't have much beyond the outline of the theme.  As some other reviewers have noted, it would have made a decent magazine article, but instead it is filled out to book length with repetition, semi relevant trivia, and melodramatic hyperbole of the "superior" Victorian English kind 
 The interpretations of the Aztec empire in this book were misleading and deficient when it was first published in 1984; now they are both bad and outdated. According to the authors, the driving force of Aztec imperial expansion was rabid religious fanaticism. Crazed bloodthirsty warriors supposedly ran around conquering peoples with no sense of planning of strategy, and with no economic motivation (sounds sort of like the bloodthirsty Maya of Mel Gibson's movie Apocalypto). This interpretation does not for work Apocalypto, and it does not work for the Aztec empire either.  I'm not qualified to evaluate the Inka sections of the book. But if you are interested in Aztec imperialism, please check some of the post-1984 literature 
 Joe Carpenter lost his wife and two daughters when the plane they were traveling in crashed. A year later Joe is still grieving, he quit his job, sold his house and is thinking of suicide.  He visits the graves of his wife and daughters to find a woman taking pictures of the graves. He wants to know what she is doing, she says she was on the plane and survived. Men start shooting at her and then start following Joe. He wonders how anyone could have survived the crash.  Joe goes back to visit some of the people who lost love ones in the crash. The greiving family members are happy now that a woman named Rose has visited them. Joe can't figure why they would be so happy. Then the family members start commiting suicide.   Joe decides to go back to the place where is plane crashed since he has not been able to face it before now. He meets a family at a ranch near the crash site. They tell him a woman and small girl visited them the night of the crash and her name was Rose, and she had a small girl with her named Nina. The same name and description of Joe's youngest dead daughter. Could Rose and his daughter be the sole survivors of the crash?  Joe finally meets Rose and she tells him that his daughter is alive, then she tells him the story behind her surviving.  Enter the twilight zone!!!!    I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.  The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.  First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.  This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one. 
 First of all, I have to say Alice Adams is (was, alas) one of my favorite writers. Of short stories. Not novels. I was thrilled to have won a short story competition to be in one of her workshops. To me, almost all of her stories are perfect. I can read them over and over. Her novels, however, are a different story. Rich Rewards has its rewards and there is something intriguing about Second Chances. But all the others left me disappointed.  A disaster.  Which is how I saw "After the War" from page one. Ridiculous characters. A mess. I would rather that my memories of Alice Adams did not include this awful work 
 After reading countless poor reviews of the Dolce desk and hutch, I was quite skeptical about ordering it online. ... I gave in and ordered the set from target.com. The desk arrived in almost perfect condition (a few smudges in the stain); however, only half the hutch was in its box! The entire drawer (left side of hutch) was missing, the hardware was missing, and the assembly instructions were missing. ... I recommend calling your local Target store to check the Dolce collection's availability (and the parts inside!) before you waste the time and gas to get there. Aside from the missing hutch, the desk looks really great in my home office. 
 This (text)book is difficult to understand -not just because of many typos and grammatical errors. The content summarises the concepts introduced in Goldratts novels. Half the book looks like a reprint of The Goal -and yet Goldratt recommends on more than one occasions to re-read the novel.... I enjoyed the novels, but this book looks more like a marketing gag for Goldratts seminars or the journal he writes, publishes and sells 
 I cant believe all of these comments in the reviews. Your all so stupid. Its only a tv show and not even very good one.  I'm 10 years old and I liked this show when it first started. It was good when it started, it was difrent to the other shows on Disney and it was funny.  But now I think all of the Raven storys are the same. Its the same evry week, Raven sees the future and it looks good or bad.  Something happens and she tries to change it. Then Raven sees something else happens, so she tries to change it again.  This happens a few times in each story and by the end we find out that Raven didnt really know evrything that weas going to happen and it didnt go the way she wanted it to but it all finished happaly for evrybody.  Thats why I think the show is boring now. You know whats going to happen evry time. Its boring and Im going to stop waching it 
 This book was such a waste of my time and money.  The problems began within the first pages.  Ms. Joy must be a big Star Wars fan.  The chacter names, their weapons(a light saber???),  the Yoda knock off!!! Give me a break!!! If that wasn't bad enough Deana was an unbelievible chacter.  First is her reaction to finding a strange man in her livng room.  She doesn't freak out too much and when she finds out that he is from another plant what does she do??  She takes him on vacation with her because according to Lorgin he can't leave her side. Totally unbelievible!!! Lorgin is a jerk and I didn't like him one bit.   He was quick to anger and constantly used sex to control Deana.  If she step out of line and questioned him he became angry and had sex with her.  I dislike weak female chacters who can be controlled by sex. On the rare occassions that Deena did act like she had a brain. All Lorgin had to do was strip her and have sex and that has the end of that. This was my first Dara Joy book and unless I can read another free at the library it will be my last.  Also this magical quest that Lorgin was on was never really explained and the ending was very anticlimatic 
 I just purchased this book, and I was really excited when I received it.  However, after 5 attempts of trying to install the CD-ROM, I gave up, and... the worest thing is, I tried to visit the website the book provided, in order to get to contact with them & ask for help... I was not allowed to view the page... cuz they blocked a lot of IP address, and the cable company that I have is on their list.........   If you want to get a USEFUL CD-ROM for drug reference, don't get this book... it will cause you a lot of headache & troubles.  Get Nursing200X drug handbook published by Springhouse.  The software is good, and I never had any problem with it 
 I have say that I am pretty disapointed in the over all production of the DVD. It would never stand up against the David Mallet attention to detail of the "Music and Passion" DVD.  First of all the video is way over saturated thoughout because the concert is not really lite for television at all. At best it's a 4 or 5 camera shoot with no crowd flybys or jib shots. It looks worse if you watch it on an HD monitor. The audio is even worse than the video. It sounds like they took a 2 channel board mix and attempted to peel off a 5.1 surround mix which is not very clean. The audio is very thin with a weak mid-range and a very poor bass mix. I had to crank my sub-woofer all the way up just to hear the bass and it still is not that great. Finally, Barry Manilow in the round is really nothing to watch. I love him and would rather see the band behind him rather then in a pit off stage. He looks alone and the composition of the shots are flat and unbalanced. He also looks uncomfortable because it.  The production numbers are hard to watch and average at best. Dave Koz is big help on "Brooklyn Blues" but hard to see because they never throw a spotlight on him. At least not a good one.   Barry is strong as ever though. I guess I got my 13 dollars worth but given the chance to but this DVD again knowing what I now, I wouldn't buy it.  Sounds like I'm a snob but I'm not. I'm spoiled on HD and have high television standards. Quality sound and video are a must these days.    I hope he teams up with David Mallet again. I'll buy that DVD.  Sorry Barry. This one just doesn't stand up to the others.  S. 
 I fell in love I guess with the radio edits. When the CD came out and I purchased it, I blindly thought this was what I would be getting. But to my surprise, I ended up getting quite a bit of RAP mixed in with the songs that to me completely ruined them all.  I threw the CD in the trash, and have learned my lesson with purchasing any future PCD audio 
 I picked this book up after reading both Books in the Bartimeus Trilogy and was excited to see what else Jonathan Stroud could conjure up. This book was a let down. I just couldn't get into the plot. I even found the story somewhat disturbing and eerie, especially for young children to read. There are very evil characters in this book who would be much better suited for an adult sci-fi novel, rather than a book marketed for children and young teens. The characters were unlikeable, and the plot just never seemed to grab my attention. I was very dissapointed that this is from the same author who wrote the amazing Bartimeus trilogy books! Well, I figured I would add my two cents in and let people know I just didn't like this book 
 Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like " no wonder men leave us for younger woman". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud 
 Like many of the reviewers here, I am an Anne Rice fan. However, I knew that there were going to be liberties taken and was comfortable with them. I mean, few of the "Dracula" movies throughout the years have had anything to do with Bram Stoker's novel. All I wanted - and expected - was a flashy, no substance guilty pleasure movie, a la "Dracula 2000." That alone should tell you my expectations.  But QotD failed even as a guilty pleasure. The storyline didn't make a lot of sense when taken on it's own, and the acting was bad to bland. I also take issue with the badly-done look of the vampires. Rice's vampires are supposed to be beautiful, whereas this bunch looked like Eurotrash or people at a Halloween spook house.  However, one good thing about this movie is the music videos for Lestat. SInce the videos are included on the DVD, it earns 1 star 
 I requested this cart for my 2 yr. old last Christmas - it's cute and "goes with" her dolly, but I really wish I'd asked for a more sturdy cart. She likes that the basket separates, but the handle is so flush with the basket, she can only put smaller things in it. I thought it'd be fun that the basket and seat detach, but they are difficult for a child to put back on and she has to ask me to do it. Plus, both of her dollies' legs get caught in the seat so she can't get them out either. Most of the food things are cardboard, which I yes, laminated with packaging tape, and they still did not hold up. The banana, milk and dish are cute, but I don't think they warrent choosing this cart 
 Just awful, don't waste your money 
 Don't bother this dvd consist of only two video tracks and i think its a day light robbery. It aint wirth the money 
 I recently bought this radio, primarily for my car, but also got the home dock. It was easy to set up and install both types of kit. Unfortunately, the sound quality was very poor in both configurations. The FM modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless. It only has maybe 10 channels. I found one that was free, luckily. But even with a clear channel, the sound had a terrible hiss, that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary. The occupied channels actually worked about as well (still lots of hiss)- except when the underlying channel broke through. Even disregarding the hiss, the sound quality on the music was not very good.      I thought the problem was probably with the FM modulator, so I tried it in the home dock, connected to a *very good* home hi-fi system. The hiss was gone, but the sound quality was completely unacceptable. For whatever reason, this particular receiver doesn't like the compression artifacts very much. Satellite radio quality is, AT BEST, about like an average MP3, with highly compressed signals (some channels better than others). This receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect, and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string "telephone" most of the time. It was vert irritating very quickly.      The form factor (about the size of a modern walkie-talkie) was fine, and pretty easy to fit in the car. It also seemed to be pretty solidly built. But all of that is completely moot if it doesn't work properly.         I returned the receiver and both kits the next day. 
 The book is really not that realistic when it comes to buying properties, especially for a novice investor. It helps with some real estate lingos but not with the trade itself. A lot of the examples are too shallow. It's like, the author only gives you an idea but does not go into details. Also, there are lots of "plug-ins" about the author's website and other newsletters. I think it's more of a sales pitch than a book 
 YAAAAAAAAWWWWWWNNN! Don't even bother buying and listening to this CD. Every song on here lacks emotion, meaningful lyrics, and any type of memorable melody. Standards are set so low that any untalented fool can get a record deal, sample to their hearts content, and win a Grammy. Skip this and get Stevie Wonders greatest hits collection 
 I must admit that I have never [ and will never ] read this book. I only write this review so those who read it will know that Robert Groden is an unscrupulous person who continually lies [ I have evidence ] and misstates the truth in his writings.  My roommate visited Dallas a few months ago [ and the sixth floor museum ] and upon his return he was eager to share with me a periodical named 'JFK: The Case For Conspiracy' [ written by Groden; 46pgs/ New Frontier Publishing 2003 ]. He, knowing that I believed Oswald acted alone, quickly turned to page 40 and showed me a photogragh of what appeared to be smoke billowing above the grassy knoll. I calmed him down and tried to explain to him that it would be awfully ignorant of them conspirators to use that kind of gunpowder, when "smokeless" gunpowder was invented in the 1870's!! We didn't talk much more about it [ he is aware that I know this case ], but I decided to read the thing anyways. Not surprising, 46 pages of nonsense.  To give you a small sampling of the lies that this guys writes, here are a few paragraghs from the section devoted to the murder of Officer J. D. Tippit [ pg 14/ only one page devoted to this important aspect of the case!!! ]. Pay attention to the third paragragh, it's hilarious......  .............About forty minutes after the assassination, Dallas Police officer J. D. Tippit was shot to death in what may have been an unrelated incident several miles from the assassination scene in the Oak Cliff section of Dallas.  The official investigators all came to the unsupported conclusion that Oswald had shot Officer Tippit. There is absolutely no evidence linking the two crimes, and none of the witnesses who actually witnessed the Tippit killing, indentified Lee Oswald [ a vicious canard ] as the murderer.  The physical evidence also tends to clear Oswald as the Tippit killer. Shortly after 1:00pm Oswald arrived at his rooming house at 1026 North Beckley in Oak Cliff. Departing the house " a few minutes after 1:00", Probably about 1:04 to 1:05 according to his landlady Earlene Roberts, he waited at the bus stop on the corner heading north. Tippit was shot nine tenths of a mile south of the rooming house at about 1:10 to 1:11 pm [ more like 1:15, but I won't harp on that ]. This would only allow five to seven minutes [ well, which is it: 5, 6, or 7 minutes? ] for Lee to arrive at the scene of the shooting nearly a mile away. It would take an Olympic class runner, or a co-conspirator driving him, for Oswald to get to Tenth Street and Patton Avenue in time......................  ???????? CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT THAT HAS TO DO WITH "PHYSICAL EVIDENCE"?? That entire third paragragh is derived from eyewitness testimony and has nothing to do with the "physical evidence" of the Tippit murder. Moreover, there are six pieces of physical evidence that tie Oswald to the crime scene, including: Oswald's 38 caliber pistol which was on his person at the time of his arrest; four spent 38 caliber hulls found at the scene which were matched to Oswald's pistol [ballistically ], to the exclusion of every other pistol in the world!!; and Oswald's jacket [ identified by Marina Oswald and fibers found on the inside of the jacket matched the brown and orange fibers of Oswalds shirt, EXCACTLY!! ], which was found two blocks from the crime scene in a gas station parking lot on Jefferson Blvd. Further, three eyewitnesses [ Helen Markham, Jack Tatum, and Domingo Bienvidas ] saw the shooting and positively indentified Lee Oswald as the shooter. Not to mention the six eyewitnesses that identified Lee Oswald fleeing the scene with a gun!! But Mr. Groden would have you believe that the Dallas Police were running around, coming to an "unsupported conclusion". And he is one of the "leading advocates" for conspiracy [that should tell you something ].   Groden is a fraud and a grifter, and he puts his kids through school because people are too hardheaded to look at the evidence, which is overwhelming. My advice is to stay away from anything this guy is selling.   
 We ordered this gate with the special attachments for our staircase.  First of all, we had to order 4 different pieces to make it work, since they make you order each little piece separately.  We spent all night putting it together and it didn't work for us.  The actual gate is very small, I don't see how it would be big enough for any opening.  Even with the extension kit, it was still not long enough.  The extension kit is so rickety that it just kept falling apart.  It is a very poor design and way overpriced.  We spent over $150 (with shipping and all of the extras we had to buy) for this piece of junk that just kept falling apart.  Save your money and buy a different gate 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 No wonder they didn't produce any other live action productions of Dr. Seuss books until after his death.  This film gave me a headache.  The direction and pacing of the film is flat, the musical numbers were unmemorable and boring(inexplicably nominated for an Oscar!), the acting was wooden, the sets were garish and ugly.  At least this film is not the cynical merchandising vehicle that the two most recent screen adaptations of Dr. Seuss works were.  I think Dr. Seuss works best in small doses like the short animated TV shows that were made some thirty-odd years ago.  Do check out the "Gerald McBoing-Boing" cartoon thats included on the disc.  It contains more wit and imagination in a few minutes than "Dr. T" does in ninety minutes 
 I found this book to be a disappointing read. The writing was simple and lacking descriptions that had depth.  Half way through I just put the book down, which wasn't terrible far along, because there was a lot of dead white space between the large font type. I couldn't help but think this book was written by someone cashing in on their Amish ancestors, that they, in this case Louise Stoltzfus, doesn't understand.   Good Books has some outstanding books available, I am not sure why they bothered to publish this one 
 When Soft Image was a novelty and 3D construction a really defying task for computers and designers, this work could be considered a  reference. It has gone old though. Once the techniques used in the animation are not so complex anymore, some of then are features of today 3d softwares, some so simple that even my young daughter masters, the animation gets very boring and naive looking at some point. Music is not so good to be worth the whole work. Even so, the authors deserve their merit 
 This television performed admirably for 7 months. Great picture and good sound. Now...it begins to "whistle" more and more loudly after being on for one hour. It needs to be shut off, allowed to rest, then can be used for another short while. After 90 days any labor must be paid for out of one's own pocket...and any tv repair person will charge at least $80 to just come take a look...You do get what you pay for; I got a nice tv for $14 a month for 7 months! If you can afford something a little better it is worth getting something that is better quality 
 Years ago, a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends, and decide to keep a secret. Years later when they're all in high school, the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them. Your typical 80s horror film, not very notable other than Leslie Nielsen, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is one prom, better left unattended 
 This is utter rot. Another stinker from the withered pen of MCall Smith. Plotless, overly peppered with Mr McCall Smith's book of quotations, up-tight, and worst of all - boring.  Mr McCall, don't give up the day job 
 I recieved it promptly, but it didn't work. I took it to Walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler. I did that, buying a battery for twenty dollars and still cannot get the time to set right. I've read the manual over and over. My sons did the same. It looks nice but doesn't work and its been very aggravating. I wouldn't recommend it 
 Dershowitz is supposed to be a college professor, yet he consistently cuts and pastes sources from Joan Peters fraud, From Time in Memorial.  Norman Finkelstein all proves without any shadow of doubt that this book has manipulated figures from prominent Jewish historian Benny Morris.  Finkelstein debated Dershowitz on Democracy Now about this issue.  Despite Dershowitz's constant interruptions I believe it is the most intertaining debate I have ever seen.  Please download it from Finkelstein's website if you have time.  Dershowitz is just one example of people contributing to the distortion history and creating a fog to the real crisis in Palestine.   
 THE MOUSE THAT ROARED was a disappointment to me in many ways--the tortuous academic prose style, the ever-present word "pedagogy" in all of its various forms, the rather sinister view of the Disney Company's motivations in their influence on education and popular culture.  I was especially disappointed in Giroux's treatmemt of Walt Disney, who he refers to occasionally as "Old Walt Disney" (Old?) In his discussion, he presents as facts some myths about Walt Disney that have been refuted by a host of scholars and historians.  I feel that this is a disservice to the memory of Walt Disney, and further, it makes me question the entire content of the book 
 The Chinese economy is growing. Our economy is sliding. We have a crumbling primary school education system that performs poorly. Our prison population is exploding. The institution of marriage is falling apart thanks to insane divorce laws.  And our currency stands at the brink of a meltdown.  The only way we can compete on the international scene is to get our own house in order and create jobs. Not bomb everyone that acts against 'our interests'.  Should we start bombing Venezuela if they decide to sell oil to China instead of the US? Is Taiwan really worth starting a global thermo nuclear war? China taking over Taiwan will be much like China taking over Hong Kong. China's incentive will be to keep their economy moving. This book is xenophobia to the extreme 
 As a type 1 diabetic for 40 years I found Cheating Destiny to be a negative and depressing book. It does not offer much hope for a type 1 diabetic who is properly managing his diabetes with few complications. I even question how accurate some of the facts are especially with life expectancies for diabetics in good control. I think this book is best geared to parents of juvenile diabetics 
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 Disney definitely is getting their money's worth out of this guy. They give him a teaching award, and then their publishing arm, Hyperion, gets him to crank out these books of platitudes, making what I'm sure is a pile of cheddar for both Mickey and Ron. It seems to me though, that there is some question as to whether or not Ron has any claim on still being a teacher or "educator". A quick glance at his web site has him scheduled for speaking engagements into October '05, well past the start of the new school year. Speaking before docile groups of teachers at an inservice is hardly the same as facing a classroom full of rowdy adolescents. There is also a claim on his web site that he is starting a school for diadvantaged kids and that he is "arranging funding", yet their is no fund raising appeal on the site or any details as to where the school might be, grade levels, etc. With many urban school systems allowing charter schools, and with his reputation, I'm sure that he could have had such a school funded and running for this school year. Of course to run a school, he would have to deal with students again, and they wouldn't be handing him cash, like you, if you buy this book 
 Funny that a book about execution doesn't get it accomplish. The authors have a lot of experience and I am sure are good at leading and executing. However, the book does not get to the point. The authors ramble about their managing experience and almost 300 pages to transmit few ideas 
 This is the story of a very arrogant doctor who quits his medical practice because of what his "Inner Teacher" told him. This could be a sign of psychosis. Nowhere in the books is the distinction between psychosis and psychic ever made. Perhaps Joy does not want his readers and potential students to know the difference 
 Find out the back-story to the Stones songs - what a great read I thought as I opened this book. Naw! The author HAS gathered some good pictures of the Stones, however, the synopsis of the songs is horrible. There are no quotes about the songwriting from either Keith or Mick; the comments are all the author's GUESSES of what the stones were writing about. Some of the comments are very trivial. I agree whole-heartedly with Richard Carlton, a most knowledgable reviewer regarding the Rolling Stones. See his review also. One star for the photos 
 I am one of the early Chenoweth fans.  Her TV show, Charlie Brown, Wicked, and her first album, were soooo fab.  How did she wind up dong an album even Kathie Lee Griffin would be ashamed of 
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 I bought 2 sets of this speedo ear plugs.  Those 2 sets shipped to me are different as shown online.  They aren't that comfortable while plug into the ears, the rings of the rubber are a little too thick and hard. 
 For those familiar with and sympathetic toward the story of Whitley Strieber, this movie is worth watching once, although you will likely find it disappointing.   For the uninitiated: Whitley Streiber is a science fiction writer who claims to have been abducted, probed, and otherwise hassled by alien life forms. Communion is based on his best-selling book of the same name, the first book from a series that details his alleged interactions with little grey men.  Walken is perfect for the role, and he seems to relish the opportunity to release his weirdness so freely. Fans of Walken such as myself also owe this one viewing, though like our UFO-loving counterparts, most of us will also be disappointed.  For each chilling moment in the film - and there are a few - there is a sibling moment which is overly amateurish and undeniably boring. The dialogue during near the end of the movie - where Walken's Streiber character contemplates the aliens with his wife while perusing an art gallery - is poorly written and the actors clearly know it. The soundtrack is hopelessly-dated guitar wankery.  A closing scene where Walken gets chummy with some aliens is confusing and embarrassing to watch.  This movie could have been good. It should have been good. Another six months writing the screenplay might have gotten it there.  
 This product is very expensive.  It eats filters if you`re on well water.  I have to clean the unit more frequently then is normal--everytime i change the water, and the filters, when they work, need to be changed once a week at $.13.88 a pop.  i bought this to avoid having to buy distilled water,  but  that was a mistake.  It humidifies well, but I know there are better cheaper ones out there 
 The wedding kit book constantly refers to chapters you should reread in the weddings for dummies book, so if you do not own BOTH books, it's useless. The wedding planner on the cdrom is only a demo version, and only allows you to add ten guests, and expires after a few weeks. I did however find some of the standard planning forms very useful, but you could find all and more of the info included in this book online if you really wanted to save yourself the money 
 First, let me say that by quality film standards this is a terrible movie, in many respects. I live to walk on videos of this type with football cleats. But, this movie falls into the "I hated this movie so much, I couldn't help but watch it whenever it was on" category. And now I love it. I don't know what it is about this movie. I tried to put my finger on it many times. I always have and always will hate "Sleepless in Seattle," which is a totally contrived load of crap. But "You've Got Mail" has an undefinable charm to it that forces you to look past it's simplified portrayal of a happy go lucky, skip around the neighborhoods of New York atmosphere. It makes you question why you buy into such sappy dialogue and situations. It's not just because of the Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks chemistry, because I hated the despicable "Sleepless in Seattle" and always thought the entire premis of "Joe Versus the Volcanoe" was a joke. But in this movie, contrived as it may be, that interplay between the two works. Though their acting is also hammy at best, I also love the contributions of Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Stephen Zahn and Jean Stapleton. This is one of my guiltiest pleasures. I'll only watch it with the remote on toggle to some type of sports programming in case my friends walk in on me while I'm watching it so I can jump inmmediately to the "Binford Lumberjack Finals," or something like that. But were they to walk in at the end of this movie and find me glossy eyed with a lump in my throat, I'd never hear the end of it. I love this movie. There! I admit it. 
 Although Goodman is generally attributed as on of the leaders of the Anti-Realist position, Ways of Worldmaking does not provide a good argument for that position.  Goodman's talk is highly open to interpretation, but  most interpretations lead to trivial truth or outlandishly bizarre  scenarios.  The lack of detailed argument makes refutation difficult, but  still it is a must read for those interested in what Anti-Realism is 
 I was very disappointed with the authors obviously biased view of the LDS religion.  The authors stated at the first of the book that most of their research was conducted doing interviews, which shows their lack of true knowledge about how the church works.  In describing the sacred temple ordinances in the church they obviously relied on some disgruntled and attention seeking ex-mormons for information, because the information was totally and without question wrong!  I think the authors were on a witch hunt of the Mormon Church.  They constantly protrayed the church as being the guilty party in this when it was one or two sick men that cheated and lied to make money.  Just because one person, that happens to be a member of the church, does something wrong, doesn't make the church responsible.  That one person can't speak for the whole church, but these authors obviously thought they could.  The only good part of the book is that it does have a lot of information on the history of what happened.  My suggestion to the authors in the future, stick to writing about what happened, not your feelings about one group or the other.  This was a very biased and unfair protrayal of the Mormon religion, I feel sorry for those of you that read this book and get a very distorted view of this religion.  
 The storyline is way over-the-top, the plot is very poor, the red-neck-America-knows-best attitude of the writer is funny and sometimes annoying. Still, I've red worse books. But not many. 
 I wish there were 0 star. Although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them. After searching a lot for buying a present for my sister's birthday, I found this sandal and I decided to buy. I ordered it on March 9th and after 20 days !! , still I haven't received them !!!!!! I am getting my money back.  Not only I have wasted my time but also I should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late!!!! Conclusion: These sandals are very beautiful but NEVER fall for them. 
 Ross Gregory Douthat often tells a good story, but ultimately runs into trouble when his assertions, which are nearly never supported with data, turn out to be wrong, as shown by the course of history. Especially noteworthy is the apparent bottom line for the book in which he claims that the gulf between George W. Bush and Bill Clinton was, "far less significant than the angry voices at either end of the spectrum would have one believe." With the murder of at least 200,000 Iraqi citizens, the rejection of Clinton's participation in the Kyoto environmental accords, his focus on intelligent design, his attempts to privatize social security, his corruption in the awarding of no-bid war contracts and Katrina cleanup contracts, and his desire to have the government intrude on all aspects of our personal lives, Bush has proven himself to be as far apart from Clinton as possible, with deadly results. Clinton was a compromiser who worked with people., Bush never compromises, and listens to no one. Douthat further cuts on the "liberal" Harvardians who protested for a living wage for janitors on the campus, then after poking fun at their hair and presumed bathing habits, admits that they were correct to fight the good fight. He goes through college largely consumed with partying, booze, girls, frats (Harvard equivalent), and avoiding classwork, then rails against those who go to college to party, drink, chase girls (or boys) and join frats. IN SUMMARY, Douthat gets angry with the world that he eagerly embraces, blaming everyone but himself for the world condition and the condition at Harvard. He can dish it out, but he takes no personal responsibility for helping anyone else. "Me First" should have been the title of the book. In that sense, the book is a perfect reflection of his stated political views. Funny thing is, he writes wonderful articles in  The Atlantic, to which I have subscribed for many years 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 This book is not about dreams, so if you want to know about dreams, you should get "The Dream Book" instead.  I don't understand this book 
 I read a LOT of chick lit and knowing they're not all Pulitzer worthy, I was surprised at how boring I found Confessions of a Nervous Shiksa.  There's a LOT of skipping around in chronology which sometimes works but doesn't here, the characters seem undeveloped, and hello, the main character is mean to a dying dog.  Maybe some find that to be not so bad but how does that make me want to keep reading about this person?  By the end of the book I felt like the character hardly made any advances, and those that she did make were only revealed in the last 10 pages or so.  Don't bother paying full price -- this one'll be remaindered soon and you'll find it at a used book sale or outlet store 
 This was a complete waste of money.  A little phamplet of a book written by a very spoiled woman who is in love with herself more than anyone else 
 One thing you will find reading through many reviews is a dissatisfaction with the state filings. This is my own experience and this may be the last year I use TaxCut because of it. First of all, it would not allow me to e-file my state return but didn't explain why. I later discovered that for most states you apparently can't e-file a partial year return. Then when printing out the state return it told me I had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program. I later found out that Taxcut does not support all state tax forms! I then had to get that form and fill it in manually, and then discovered I owed less than before because Taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains. AND there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had.  TaxCut also advised me I could save $1000 off my fed bill by contributing to an IRA. So I opened and IRA and contributed $4000. When I went back to TaxCut and entered the details it told me I wasn't eligible for any tax deduction. I was ready to be tied up! This software is seriously dysfunctional.  I'm guessing by this stage you get the idea. Bottom line: I will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year.  Oh, by the way, if like me you were unable to efile and you paid for the efile option, you can get a credit from H&R by calling 1-888-4TAXCUT option 2,2,0 
 I'm not a Civil War scholar, so I'll defer to reviewers with greater knowledge about the accuracy of what is portrayed in the film.  As a film, however, this one is lacking in many ways, from hyper-melodramatic voice-overs to noticeably poor editing.  When combined with inaccurate history, the disappointment is doubled.  Andersonville was directed by John Frankenheimer, who created many good or great films, one of which, The Manchurian Candidate, is a masterpiece.  With his resume, I have to believe that the intentions of the movie-makers were good, but the end product (a made-for-TV movie) reflects an inferior medium.  A story as naturally powerful and important as Andersonville deserves a greater commitment to realism, and the drama should have been derived from historically accurate fact.   Instead, the drama was manufactured--history was dramatized. It's a film that deserves to be made again, re-written by someone with a commitment to accuracy and produced by a company more interested in the best available version of the truth than in pandering to an audience of supposed dullards with second-rate pap.  When stories like Andersonville are not told with excellence, the fall into mediocrity is precipitous and leaves me feeling that the story should not have been filmed at all 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 After reading Ms.Henrion's first book and utilizing her herbal remedies as  well as relaxation techniques I found my health greatly improved. I was  eager to learn more and looked forward to reading Healing Alternatives for  Beginners. Like her first book it is  very concise and easy to read. I do  miss the teddy bears from her first book but the affirmations scattered  through out the book are great. I like that the information presented is  backed by research as well as Kay's personal experiences. Highly recommend  this book to anyone who is fed up with "traditional" medicine  where we pop a pill for anything and everything that ails us 
 i ordered this book to give me some ideas and decorating tips, what i got are pictures of old flea market items, that have nothing to do with each other. didn't help a bit, and truthfully if it didn't cost so much to return, i'd return it in a second 
 After hearing so much about the book, I must admit to a disappointment in its contents.  As a Belgian that has immigrated to the USA, I am well familiar with the many contrasts between Europe and the US and found Mr. Reid's observations to be lacking both in perspective and completeness.  For example, Mr Reid appears enamored with the European welfare state, vaunts its many virtues and describes it as a central pillar of the new "European identity" that is superior to the barbarous American model, but admits in small print in its Appendix that the European welfare state faces a crisis that far surpasses the US social security system in magnitude and will not survive in its present form.  I felt that a fair discussion on the topic should have included a discussion on the countless challenges to the welfare state.  I thought that many of his other observations lacked the same kind of roundness.  I felt that the book lack depths and was primarily suitable to a reader in search of a caricature on the relationship between Europe and America. 
 Here began the death of all substantial poets 
 I give it two stars only because the two mystery's are decent.  This is some of the worst writting I have found in a long time of reading.  The dialogue is totally unrealistic and the writing is awful.  I don't know how much Patterson had to do with this book but he should be ashamed.  I ask you  how many women do you know that use a term like "skirt hound" for a man who chases women?  I actually listen to this book as an unabridged audio, thinking it would sound better than it read...silly me!  It was even worst because I had to hear the actor read the awful dialogue.  Even my wife, who is a big Patterson fan, disliked this one 
 Rockin' Red Guitar, eh? Perhaps rockin' should ready "rocky," as the plastic case is easily broken by any youngster... or oldster, for that matter. Additionally, this "toy" comes pre-stringed with some form of non-natural strings, supposedly nylon -- two of these non-gut strings broke when attempting to ellicit some music from the item. Definitely not for a young child! It probably wouldn't last for a half-hour under constant use by smaller folk 
 This book kicks off the Second Foundation trilogy--and makes rather a mess of things. Oh, some parts have virtues. The early history of Hari and Dors, for instance. But it is overlong, badly in need of editing, and thoroughly tedious in parts. The Voltaire/Jeanne d'Arc subplots are both overdone and underdone---too much focus is given to them, and the details are not interesting. THe next book in the series, Foundation and Chaos, is far better 
 Really uncomfortable. I wore them twice and then threw them out. They sagged like a sad pair of tights you used to wear when you were little. And they became transparent like they were going to rip at any moment. Not worth the $5 I paid 
 This is the most boring book in the entire world! It wasn't very upbeat in my opinion, and nothing really happened! I would never reccomend this book to anyone.. 
 Despite all the good reviews, this game is pathetic. Here are the reasons:  Horrible Stereotypes: If you're a Brujah character, you'll be like every other Brujah in existence. It's just that simple, if you want Celerity and Potence you play Brujah, if you want Presence you play Ventrue (those who've read the book understand the last sentence). The only good way to get a nice mix is to make a Clanless (Munchkin Alert!) or make up your own Clan (which Vamp players hate, because it forces them to think)  LARPs: I've chased LARP groups out of the graveyard near my house more than once. I hate them only because they don't respect the dead (or those that work during the day and SLEEP at night). You all don't have to LARP to play the game, I read the book. Sit around a table and eat pretzels like all other RPGers. Don't be afraid, it might develop your character and imagination to not run around at midnight and annoy all your neighbors and people who think you're in a dark section of the SCA.  Too expensive: For a book with no color whatsoever (and barely a system), it's as much as all the other RPGs on the market. Did I miss something? No color is stylish? That costs Extra?   Munchkin Factor 3: You'll have at least 3 munchkins in your group if you play with 4-6 characters. These munchkins usually have goth tendencies. No offense to goths, but y'all force normal people to hate you.   Game Mechanics are weak like a wet paper towel: the Soak die rules leave much to be desired, as two combatants could pound on eachother forever (I believe I had combat with 2 combatants last 3 hours once). The skills system is dumb, making a weak character able to do great things if he has enough of the skill.  Uncompatibility: All the WOD games CANNOT be played with one another. Mages are more powerful than Werewolves are more powerful than Vampires are more powerful than Hunters. Have fun you amalgamers!  We're Roleplayers!: The pompusness of Vamp players is quite annoying, since the system roleplays for them. Anyone could game Vampire. It's the same reason d20 has no respect with the game community elders (at least in my mind).  Finally, Suggestions: Don't play Vampire the Masquerade. If you really want a vampire game, upgrade to Vampire: the Requiem.  It's done much better than this tras 
 (2 & 1/2 stars)  After reading of Thurston Moore's interest in this band, I thought I'd check 'em out.  Once I listened to the CD, though, I was very underwhelmed.  I can see where Moore would like the BYOP sound - nearly all gleeful and unrestrained bashing.  They remind me a little of X, and the singer even sounds a bit like early Patti Smith at her most demonstrative.  The big difference between BYOP and their elders, however, is that those other people (X and Smith) played some actual melodies and tunes.  BYOP merely seems to plow their way through every song.  The lead vocalist doesn't SING very often; mostly she just shouts or sometimes speaks the lyrics.  The lack of distinguishable melodies is a big problem. I can admire their youthful energy and enthusiasm, but it doesn't make me want to hear the music again.  On those few occasions when she actually does SING - as on "Adventure" and "October, First Account" - the results are pretty unimpressive.  I kind of like the forceful "We Will Vacation," with its cool guitar flourishes, but that's an oasis in a desert of mind-numbing slams. 
 I'm a big fan of this series, but "Death Dance" is a dud.  First of all, the whodunit itself is a big "who cares?"  I'm still not sure why Talya Galinova was killed.  And the similarities to her death and the real-life murder of a Met orchestra member in the 1980s is just plain tasteless.  The whole mystery could have been set on Broadway (where most of the book takes place anyway) without detracting from the (minimal, far-fetched and uninteresting) plot.  Not to mention that Fairstein is way off in her Met Opera research:  Only twelve chandeliers rise at the beginning of each performance, not thirty-two, there are five tiers in the house, not six, and there are 92 standing room positions at the back of the orchestra, not the whopping 275 she claims.  OK, no big deal in the grand scheme of things, but very sloppy mistakes nonetheless.  One of the great things about Fairstein's other thrillers has been the New York history with which she peppers them, and "Death Dance" is no exception.  There's fascinating info about the Shriners and their legacy in NY, although the character to whom Fairstein gives this knowledge seems to exist for the sole purpose of pontificating about it.  On the plus side, the sub-plot, involving a dasterdly doctor is pretty interesting; and there's a gripping discussion between heroine Alex Cooper, and a couple of colleagues involving the application of a particular legal statute.  But none of that is enough to make "Death Dance" anything more than a long, dull waste of time and paper 
 This was a BORING movie. I can't really say anything else, except it was putting me to sleep. The main characters  were never developed. None of them were really interesting to me anyway. If a movie doesn't make me care about the characters and their lives, then the movie is just a waste of time for me. I didn't care about these people or why they were in India. It would have been much nicer if the flood had just swept all these boring people away and swept the soundstage clean to set up for making a more interesting movie. If you like Myrna Loy, who was in this, I recommend you skip this and see her in "The Best Years of Our Lives" 
 Hey, I know a way you can get these practically free of charge, yeah you guessed it, join the service! But really MRE's may have come a long way from the civil war days of hard tack but they still have a long way to go before I'd actually WANT to eat them over a conventionally cooked meal. I guess it's good for emergencies though, or to act like a soldier on a camping trip 
 Well, I read this "gem" because my 8th grader had to for class. Was the pig-rape scene or the graphic butchery of a beloved pet the most disgusting part?  I guess it's supposed to show  historical life in rural Vermont but I sure could have lived without it.  "Becoming a Man"?? There are far better books out there than this that can fit that bill. Long before my daughter remembers any "lessons" of this book, I'm sure the lingering descriptions of the rivers of blood and stench will stick with her. Plus, inbetween the great lessons we got about pig farming/butchery it's a pretty dull story. 
 I found the story to be somewhat  flat.  I finally gave up  and put the book down permanently around Chapter 7.  That said, I found the reviews to be over-rated both on here and elsewhere.  Much like some of the other reviewers, I found the author repetious to a fault in her attempts at making Christopher the pig sound intelligent, cute, and cuddly. I think her inclination in doing so was a detriment to the story overall.  Besides---maybe it's me, but after reading a portion of this pig's antics, and from viewing a smattering of photos, I seriously doubt I would use adjectives such as "cute", and "cuddly" ever in describing him.  Some might argue that I missed something in not holding out and reading through 'til the end.  But my gut told me that by Chapter 7, things were pretty much as good as they were going to get, and I was wasting my time plodding along in hopes that things might actually improve.  I'm sure this pig did indeed bring alot of love and joy in both the owners, as well as other's lives.  However the book's retelling of Christopher and how deeply he influenced so many  others left alot to be desired, at least for this reader.  
 just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. 
 Caution: This review contains a couple spoilers!  First off, I have to admit that my husband and I ended up seeing this by accident, when flipping through channels. What is not accidental (and is patently inexcusable, in my opinion) is the sheer awfulness of this movie. It was so bad it was funny, and for that reason alone we watched it for the (surely unintended) comedy.    The movie is rife with stock and unoriginal characters: whiny useless blonde woman, who can only stand there and scream at critical junctures (almost as vexing as those young women in horror flicks who are running for their lives but always trip and/or fall down), sexy young doctor/bimbo character (I guess she finished that pesky PhD while still in high school), buff blonde himbo (no, that's not a typo, he's just the male surfer version of the bimbo), and a couple of token minorities, one of whom gives preachy pep talks (we actually cheered when in the midst of Jackson's character's "we must pull together as a team to survive" rah-rah speech, a shark surfaced and gulped him down raw). Yummy. Mr. Shark doesn't fancy that sanctimonious claptrap anymore than we did.  Most amusing scene: bimbo scientist feels it necessary to strip off her wetsuit before she kills a shark, and after all the drama and suspense of the impromptu strip-tease we see she's wearing sensible white undies rather than Victoria's Secret. Aww, what a disappointment. But I guess good girls don't go to heaven if they wear naughty underwear.   More things we picked up on: whenever a character cusses, drinks, smokes, or looks at porn, something terrible happens. Evil shark suddenly appears and punishes said sinner. Hardly subtle. (For example, one guy lights up a cigarette and seconds later loses a hand - hubby said this was the best anti-smoking campaign ad ever!) There are probably more than a dozen references to God throughout this film, which in itself is not objectionable, but becomes obvious and annoying after more than a couple times. There's even a "group hug" scene where all the characters join hands in a circle and pray. What is this, the 700 Club? Not to mention a shark gets stabbed with a crucifix in the end. Spare us the lofty moral overtones and get on with the story already. Oh wait, that would require a plot, wouldn't it?    A lot of people have been comparing this movie to "Jaws." I'm not sure what they've been smoking (careful there, might lose a hand!;), but the only thing this joke of a film has in common with "Jaws" is the CGI effects might as well date from the 70s. There's no excuse for a 1999 film to have CGI so terribly bad that it's just plain embarrassing after awhile. Cast should have done shadow-puppets on a wall instead - I think it would have been scarier. More entertaining, too.  This movie is so predictable, so corny, and so appallingly bad that I wonder if the actors even dare list it on their resumes. 
 Mr. Auster's Trilogy is strong in stylistic innovation but sadly lacking in imagination. His themes, plots and characters reveal a writer with a broad exposure to European literature, but the sum total of the work feels repetitive, impoverished and too smart for his own good. I lost patience for his empty characters devoid of specificity. At times, it seemed like endless, nonproductive navel gazing on the life of being an artist/sleuth. It reminds me of a much weak version of Martin Amis' Times Arrow, which I rather liked, for all its flaws. 
 I've been had is all I can say, after reading other reviews I really thought this would be an interesting, exciting movie. Instead, the story is lame, the acting is pretty pathetic and it is so NOT scary or at least gripping. I watched the whole thing as I thought maybe I am missing something, but no there is no twist thats worth mentioning as the whole movie is predictable from beginning to end. Sorry guys, but this is nowhere near, Audition, Tale of two Sisters or even Whispering Corridors 
 Chapters 1-4 were mildly interesting. Then this book went from semi-boring to an international trip of why America and Big Oil have spoiled many parts of the world. It's okay to have that opinion, just don't advertise your book as 'even-handed' or 'fair-minded'. This is a book for the Greenpeace crowd, the blame America first crowd, or your average everday San Francisco liberal.   Hugo Chavez is somewhat of an understated hero figure to the author, mainly for his anti-American rantings. Other disfunctional, violent, corrupt regimes, like Iran, Chad or Nigeria, are laid at the feet of American Big Oil. Nevermind the billions pored into (and squandered) those nations.  She wraps it up cudos to China for their forward thinking approach to oil consumption applied to automobiles. Nevermind China is one of the most poluted places on earth.   In short I found the book to be a major dissapointment. If you're looking for affirmation in the evil of America and Oil Companies, give it a try 
 I bought this radio to use while I workout.  The radio has a cicular dial (not digital) to change the station.  While you move, the station slips and will change on you.  You need to hold the radio with your hand to listen.  Definitly not a good radio for excercising 
 This book by Ramon Jimenez is limited to Caesar and his campaigns in Gaul which he led under an extraordinary command lasting from 58 B.C. to 50 B.C.  Although the book may at first appear to be informative about Roman history and Caesar, it contains too many serious errors and missassumptions to be anything more than a crude guide to military facts that Caesar himself more adequately and eloquently describes to the average reader already!  Ramon Jimenez has absolutely no credentials in classical studies, history, or anthropology of any sort. His background is solely as a civil servant in California. Mr. Jimenez didn't even begin to undertake any studies in antiquity until recently in which his inquiries amounted to nothing more than his personal pursuit of a non-chalant hobby.  He has neither a Master's or Ph.D. in anything remotedly related to anthropology, archeology, or classical studies.  There's also no indication that Mr. Jimenez has any background in Ancient Greek or Latin which would be prerequisites to presenting one's self as any sort of established authority in the field of classical studies.  Even disregarding his lack of academic qualifications to present any thesis, dissertation, or even lecture on Roman history, his poor knowledge as to the Late Roman Republic is made plainly obvious by his cursory summaries of Roman society and politics that are nothing but misleading oversimplifications at best. Mr. Jimenez' obvious lack of knowledge results in his work focusing on Julius Caesar far too narrowly giving the reader overly general, if not misleading, information as to the society, culture, and political environment Julius Caesar lived in.  Mr. Jimenez' study is essentially in a complete void of in terms of historical context and much of the information he does provide is misleading at best. One cannot understand Julius Caesar without knowing much about the Roman Republic and its agents any more than one could understand Alexander The Great without knowing any significant details about Ancient Greece, Macedonia, and Persia. This book is therefore fundamentally unreliable as an authority on the Roman Republic or even Caesar specifically.  A perfect example of Mr. Jimenez' poor scholarship is his explanation of human sacrifice in antiquity that he makes on page 38,  4. He recites multiple examples of ritualistic killings in Celtic culture (that are verifiable based on literary and archeological evidence) and then suggests that even Rome itself was equally barbaric in that it didn't ban human sacrifice until the 1st century B.C.: suggesting the conclusion that Rome either previously tolerated such acts or passed such a ban to prevent Romans from performing human sacrifice.  It is obvious here that Mr. Jimenez is ignorant as to the context of this ban because it had nothing to do with preventing human sacrifice by Romans nor was it an indication that Romans previously tolerated human sacrifice. The sources Mr. Jimenez relied on to make this argument could only be derived from the histories of Pliny and Plutarch as to a law that was proposed by Publius Crassus (father of Marcus Licinius Crassus, the triumvir) while Consul and approved by the Senate at the beginning of the 1st century B.C. which he put into execution as governor of Further Spain  (Pliny, HN 30.12; Plut. Quaest Rom. 83.) If Mr. Jimenez would have done some simple research, he would have found that this law applied only to Rome's Celtic province of Spain to prevent Celts of that region (Lusitanians/Portuguese in particular) from continuing their rampant practice of human sacrifice. No law was passed before that time because Rome had not yet come into extended contacts with Celtic tribes that extensively practiced human sacrifice (not all Celts practiced human sacrifice.)  Even worse is that Mr. Jimenez fails to recognize that Caesar himself in his Commentaries remarked with some perplexity and disgust as to Gallic druids stuffing victims into a wickerman to burn them alive. Mr. Jimenez then compounds his ignorance by stating, "[T]he heads of defeated enemies [were still]...presented to the Emperor Trajan as late as the second century [A.D.]" id.  Severed heads of executed tribal chieftains and their retinues after a battle don't meet the parameters of a ritualistic killing which involves clear religious ceremonies or institutions that seek to appease gods or natural forces with human victims (e.g. the Celts, Aztecs or other Meso-American civilizations.)  Roman legionaires bringing severed heads of enemies to the emperor isn't human sacrifice, it's simply an exemplary execution and the head is brought as proof of victory to the emperor or displayed to other enemies as a deterrent.  Such acts were purely political and military in purpose and had no religious significance: they simply entailed the army showing its victory and allegiance to the emperor or it carrying out a brutal but effective diplomacy in the name of Rome.  Although there are perhaps one or two identifiable incidents of actual ritualistic killings to appease the gods in the Early Roman Republic up to the Third Punic War (a span of several centuries!), they were anomalies that were not universally accepted by Roman contemporaries and that occurred in extremely desperate situations. By the time of the Late Republic, all Romans clearly considered the practice of human sacrifice as barbaric in the true sense of the word (i.e. foreign and uncivilized.) What is amusing is that, after citing all of the wrong examples as evidence of ritualistic killings in Rome, Mr. Jimenez fails to address the universally known Roman institution of gladiatorial spectacles that obviously came the closest to human sacrifice: even that however is somewhat debatable as it is a more distinctive category of blood sports which are primarily secular but have quasi-religious overtones as well but I digress and will leave it at that. In sum, as in other parts of his work, Mr. Jimenez here took pieces of information on Roman society out of context because he is plainly ignorant of the context in the first place and, therefore, not qualified to render a scholarly opinion on the subject.     Mr. Jimenez' poor understanding of Roman society and political structures is also evident when he states that freedmen couldn't vote (page 13,  3) which is unequivocally false. Unlike other civilizations of the time, Rome had very liberal policies regarding manumission and historical evidence is simply overwhelming in showing that freedmen (libertini) were given political suffrage as they were allocated among the four urban voting blocks (tribes) out of the total 35 voting blocks. The only political difference between freedmen and commoners(plebeians)was that they couldn't hold political offices or official priesthoods. How Mr. Jimenez could have come to an opposite conclusion is simply beyond my comprehension because not even a beginning student of Roman history would make such a blatant mistake.  Mr. Jimenez also makes errors as to the types of foods that existed at the time as well as the alimentary regiment for Roman legions.  He claims that the common food for Roman legions was lentils and beans on page 128,  2. Beans are typically understood as the New World crop variety that didn't come to Europe until more than 1500 years after Julius Caesar. Contrary to Mr. Jimenez' claim, the common diet for the Roman soldier consisted of lentils and corn (generally all edible cereals except for maize which also came from the Americas), not beans. If "beans" were at all included in the military diet, they were restricted to field/string beans: something which Mr. Jimenez fails to specify.  Lentils and corn were the staple rations of the Roman legions because they were highly nutritious, light to carry, and not as perishable as other foods such as string or field beans.  In these two examples, Mr. Jimenez again demonstrates his ignorance of the underlying culture, institutions, and history of ancient Rome to the detriment of the uninformed reader and historical truth.  These types of incomplete summaries and false facts are rampant throughout the book and clearly indicate the author's lack of knowledge as to his subject. Mr. Jimenez' poor research is indicative of a tunnel-vision approach to only a very limited segment of Roman history that is inevitably dependent on a thourough and broad understanding of the Roman Republic specifically and antiquity in general: an understanding that Mr. Jimenez clearly lacks and results in his painfully evident demonstration of poor scholarship. I have no credentials in classical studies either and even I can see the gross inaccuracies in this work. The difference with me is that I wouldn't be so arrogant as to publish a book claiming to be authoritative when it's based only on loose knowledge I obtained on my spare time as a hobbyist. This book should be shunned as an authoritative text as to anything dealing with Rome: the only thing it's clearly authoritative on is its author's ignorance of the subject matter. Indeed, this book does a gross disservice to all true scholars who have committed years of schooling and dilligent work to the study of antiquity to dispel the very same misconceptions Mr. Jimenez ignorantly propagates as sound research in this poor work.  Ignore this pitiful text and read Caesar's Commentaries directly or the work of qualified scholars of classics such as Gruen, Syme, Millar, or others who clearly know what they're writing about before they publish their work 
 Are you looking for a book that you can sit down with for three weeks and try to get through just to learn what you could have learned from any other book on the same subject? This is the book for you! Boring and SO long-winded. It doesn't tell you anything more than any other book on shyness. I would not recommend this book as a self-help book on shyness. I would, however, whole-heartedly recommend this for anyone suffering from insomnia 
 Amazingly boring and just another of those conspiracy theory books trying to lay claim to some hidden world.  Next he will tell you that there is a hidden city of wonder 1000 feet below the earth's crust with space ships that can warp out and talk to the Plutoan 
 Being a day late and a dollar short, I finally decided to buy this book despite the poor reviews.  I could not get past the introduction by Lestat (Anne) saying how stupid we all are for "not getting" his/her previous book".  She/he failed to explain what exactly it was that we were supposed to get, to my satisfaction anyway. AND the religious aspect of it all...... well I will keep my own council on that issue.   My theory regarding Anne's later efforts is (please do not take offence Ms. Rice) that Anne lost her edge after her beloved husband died.  Could it be that he had some part (a large one)in her previous novels?  The beautiful prose is gone from her writing and I think as her writing deteriorated, her ego grew.   All I can say is - Anne, stop writing, retire, open a doll hospital or be a spokesperson for charity. Kick back, bake cookies enjoy your life, just please do not torture us with any more writing.   
 Luckily this book came from the library. Don't waste your money on such a sorry attempt. No police psychologist could ever be so stupid and self-centered and still have a job. Clues ignored all over the place except when Darcy wanders into the mix 
    Never have I seen an author do so little with so much. Mr. Rodríguez seems to have taken all the most promising material he could think of - the Roaring 20's, promiscuous gay sex, a bearded lady, an exotic tropical island, communist plots, murder, the supernatural (to name a few examples) - and simply thrown it against the wall to see what would stick. Somehow the author's writing style fosters detachment rather than engagement; I never really connected with the main characters or got swept up in the narrative. In this author's hands the Roaring 20's become the Boring 20's, and I struggled to finish the book.     The germ of an engaging novel is there - in the ongoing commentary by Eleonora Duse. She is the most interesting and well-developed of the characters in the book. However, I believe that the author has a very cinematic imagination, and that the shortcomings of the book result from an inability to translate the fabulous movie that he sees in his head into compelling prose. (One sees this most clearly in the Arabian Nights party scene, which would be fantastic on film, but falls strangely flat on the page). I only wish that Rodríguez had separated his material and written a novel about Eleonora's life, and turned the rest into the Fellini-esque movie of his dreams.  My recommendation: skip the book and wait for the movi 
 It's a gimmick.  Looks good on tv, doesn't do what it says. I'm embarassed to admit I even tried it

 Bly deserves credit for introducing Spanish poetry to the American audience back in the 1950s and 1960s. Machado is a wonderful poet. Unfortunately, Bly is not a terribly good translator, and the result is a  mismatch

 Great it was delivered in a timely manner and in good condition. thank 
 When I purchased "Hog on Ice", I expected a book with hundreds of expressions along with the historical origin of each. The books does indeed have hundreds of expressions and what they mean, but the author, when describing the origin, rarely gives a definite answer. The origins frequently have phrases like, "probably came from", "could have been", "it is likely that", etc. A great book if you only want to be entertained by learning new expressions and the meaning behind some you already know. As a historical reference, however, you may want to check out Garrisons' "Why you Say It" 
 I loved Angel Heart.  I ordered the unrated (x) version from a seller who works with Amazon.  I received the R rated version. I then ordered the special edition from amazon directly which stated it was the unrated version.  However, it was also rated R.  It looks like I will have to buy it here locally.  The movie was excellent and I would recommend it to anyone.    If you are going to buy it from either a seller or Amazon, make sure you are getting the correct version 
 Improbable people in implausible situations driven by too-convenient motivations.  A thin veneer about anthropology, development, political philosophy, and Africa that drags the story along but does little to enlighten.  Obviously written with a well-thumbed thesaurus at hand, the author's vocabulary use is more tortured than inspiring.  (Or, as Mark Twain put it, "it grates on the fastidious ear.")  A decent plot, but a snoozer in its execution.  The characters are drawn with multi-layered histories that are informational but exact no empathy.  
 This is without doubt the worst book on DHTML/Javascript that I've ever read.  The author tries to be cute, funny and authorative but ends up just plain painful.  The examples are over-long and artificial, and would be difficult to incorporate into a real world application.  The author peppers the book with snazzy shots like "It's the modern way!" but rarely explains the benefits of the methodology he's pushing, and glosses over any shortcomings. For instance, in discussing regular expressions he provides a simple expression for a telephone number, then points out that it's seriously flawed.  But it's "suitable for our discussion" so onward we press, and a correct solution is never provided.  Bad luck if you were after such a beast. (Footnotes abound - often just URLs to now broken links - so you have to wonder why he couldn't have provided the solution at the bottom of the page.)  The part on Ajax is a joke - he just plugs in an out-of-date version of the Sarissa library and never scratches below the surface. Beware 
 The reading was okay, but there wasn't much meat to it. Each page has a paragraph or maybe two that tells a story. Only a handful are interesting as many explain boring stuff like where pictures of old executives are located. One of the most interesting pages told about how Disney bought up all of the FL property using fictitious companies. For the price, I was disappointed as most of it is not notable. If you're a Disney buff, get this from the library and save the $$$ - you can read it in a 1/2 hr sitting 
 As a fellow motorcycles, I applaud Garripoli for his tenacity as a rider and the effort he put forward to write and publish his book. However, his book has little or no insights to offer motorcyclists. His stories, while well reported, are poorly written and are the type of tales you tell over a bottle of beer to a friend with a sympathic ear 
 The Hole revolves around four prep school students who spend a weekend in an abandoned bomb shelter. One of the students is traumatized and makes it out alive. The others are dead.  Well, this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made.  Flaws:  * The acting. Thora Birch's pseudo English accent is extremely annoying. Most of the time, it doesn't sound real. Keira Knightly's character is way over the top. And with all of the characters, moments that are meant to be emotional are simply over the top.  * The plot is extremely convoluted. SPOILERS COMING!!  Do you really think Thora Birch would lock herself in a bomb shelter and risk her life and the lives of others for love?!!!!  The ending: STUPID. Thora Birch gets away with it, after telling a detective her story. When the detective tells Thora to make an official statement, she refuses. When confronted by other detectives, Thora lies. Okay...the extreme flaw with this scenario: the detective who has been informed of the real truth -- all she has to do is tell her superiors. At the very least, they would investigate her claim. In the movie however, all is tidily wrapped in Thora's lies. Who do you think detectives would believe? A member of their own force or a murder suspect?  There are far too many flaws with this movie to go on and on. Definitely not worth even a rental 
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 I would have given it one star but it deserves two for the last chapter which was quite good. Overall the book in my mind cannot even be compared to Notes From Underground which is a true existential work of art. My bias I believe comes from prefering an existential character to be more intelligent than the average person, not just simply more apathetic such as The Strangers main character. I found the book to be very boring. This is just my opinion, and many people find the book great and I have no quarrel with that 
 I love the story of Tristan and Isolde, so when this movie came out  I was really excited to see it. But it was an incredible dissapointment. I guess I should have known it was doomed from the start, but unfortunately they took the best six or seven bits of the movie and stuck them in the trailer so I really had no idea of the depths it would sink to. First of all, none of these actors are any good. At all. They just don't have the breadth to play these parts. Franco and Myles often get so worked up that their accents go out the window and they start squabbling like a couple of California teenagers. Badly acted California teenagers. It's not entirely their fault; I'm sure they'd be fine if they were cast in roles that were less of a stretch for them (an example: James Franco is the only one in Spiderman who doesn't suck). But an ancient Irish princess and British warrior are apparently too much of a challenge. The other actors aren't very good either. The King of Ireland has an accent that is so obviously scottish that I kept expecting him to scream "Pass the haggis!", and even Rufus Sewell fails to do a convincing job with his part.   The screenplay is also bad, as is the editing. The fight scenes were blurry and hard to follow with way too many cutaway shots, and some bright person decided that the Irish and the English should have absolutely identical battle armor so that no one would ever be able to figure out who was who. It was utterly impossible to tell who was winning.  And I know that some people just don't care about things like this, but the historical innacuracies REALLY bothered me. I'll just list them. It is highly unlikely that the Saxons and the Celts would have been cooperating. Ireland is portrayed as a united country, which it was not. It was a bunch of tribes, just like Britain. The evil empire vibe just doesn't fit. "Dunluce", obviously Dublin, is the seat of the high king of Ireland in this movie, which is ridiculous. The high king's seat is at Tara, and Dublin didn't even exist yet. It was founded hundreds of years later by the Vikings. Calling Tristan "English" is an anachronism, since he was, in fact, a Celt. English refers to the anglo-saxons, and I believe the term wasn't invented until much later. And the Irish would have been Christian at that point since it was well after Saint Patrick.   The only good thing about this movie was the prolific shots of beautiful British and Irish landscape, but for me it was just too little too late. 
 The Big Apple definition in the book is wrong again.  Other guide books have it right, but LET'S GO just doesn't care about accuracy 
 I have never written a review of a book before, but after reading this book I felt I had too. What happened to this series. The first two books were great, but this book dosen't even come close to being as good. Somebody should have cut about 300 pages from this book. The first two books in the series I could'nt put down, but this book was very difficult to finish. I dont think I will read the 4th volume in this never ending series

 Pundits would have you believe that Fox news and Rupert Murdoch are the antithesis of quality journalism.  They even based a Bond villian on Murdoch in one ofe the more forgettable movies. Nothing gets a liberal's eyes rolling than when you say you watch Fox News.  This Attackumentary wants you to believe that Fox is biased and not credible.  Watch this Attackumentary and listen for yourself to what they are saying and draw your own conclusions.  The former reporters gripe throughout this "piece" that Rupert Murdoch changed how reporters operate, for the worse in their opinion.  What actually happened is that these reporters had to work for a change.  They had to work hard, something they probably never did before.  Murdoch, like any driven person, demanded nothing less than excellence from his employees.  Those that could hang, rose with Fox news.  Those that could not keep up appear in "OutFoxed".  Fox does have a bias on its commentary section.  This draws ratings.  The thing that the pundits seem to have a problem with is separating the Journalism from the Commentary sections even with Fox putting a big sign up saying "Commentary".  They are so used to their "Mainstream" liberal journalists blending their personal views and possibly slipping in actual news that they cannot tell the difference anymore.  Here is my latest scorecard:  Mainstream Media:  Latest and greatest from Reuters, a major supplier of news to the always objective "mainstream media"; fired a reporter for falsifying photos to show violence worse than actually happened.  This photographer decided that his photos (or the war) was not alarming enough so he added a few more smoke plumes and darkened the overall image.  How many other war photos have been doctored this way?  On the Reuters' news page there is no mention of this deliberately manufactured garbage.  You had to go to their main page and look way over to the right side to find the story.  I guess they still have enough shame to be embarassed about this incident.   The bastion of liberal "non-thinking"; New York Times has had several reporters writing stories about events that they did not actually do background work on.  In other words, they phoned in their stories without any actual knowledge of the events.  They also revealed secrets that hurt the World's efforts on fighting terrorists.  CNN - Nicknamed the Clinton News Network during the 90's for swallowing anything the Clintons had to give and asking for seconds, the only thing they were upset about during the whole Lewinsky scandal was that they wanted to be the ones under the desk.  On their online "News Headlines" section they repeatedly have Lou Dobb's column appear mixed in with news as if what he says is news.  Lou Dobb's is the paid liberal mouthpiece for CNN and everything he states is opinion not news.  You would think they would put him on their opinion section but unlike Fox they don't have one.  They think it is perfectly all right to mix opinion with news.  USA Today breaks a huge story on a massive phone tapping scandal.  Oops, turns out it wasn't as massive as it seemed and the data was given voluntarily.  Over 70% of the American population agreed with the Bush administration on this move despite his otherwise low approval rating.    CBS's Dan Rather, this is the man man who nearly wept on camera when the Republican revolution swept through Congress in 1994.  All his hopes of a liberal presidency were washed away.  He launched a smear campaign against President Bush using the worst journalistic standards imaginable.  His background investigation was nil.  People discredited this story almost instantly and yet he persisted on reporting it.  After everything was said and done he still tried everything in his power to prevent having to recant.  The editor for the Los Angeles times had to put out a memo to his people to try not to be so biased during the 2004 election.  Finally there is Newsweek, whose irresponsible reporting was the direct cause of riots that led to a score of deaths and untold injuries.  They were so eager to report the desecration of Islam's holy writ that they failed to see if it actually happened.  They ended up recanting with a pseudo apology that laid the blame on everyone but themselves.  The blood may wash off easy but do the memories and guilt remain?   That is a question the reporters and the editors can only answer. If so, that is the punishment you deserve for abusing one of the most important and influential professions in the World.  Perhaps others will think twice before fanning the flames of hatred just to sell a few more issues.    These are just minor examples of how the "Mainstream" Media operates.  These are real stories and influence real events in the world, sometimes with serious consequences.  This is not the same as news commentators spouting off at the mouth about an issue of the day.  If you want more then read the book Bias by Bernard Goldberg to get a real understanding.  I will stick to Fox News as I have yet to find a major scandal regarding how they report the news.  Like any prudent person I take my news from a variety of sources and choose for myself on how to interpret what it all means.  I do take news with a grain of salt if it is coming from sources that have proven they are more interested in being first than in being correct.  CNN, Reuters, CBS, Newsweek, NY Times all fall squarely into the "dubious at best" category.  All I have gotten from this attackumentary is a bunch of liberals and hack reporters whining because Fox separates the opinions from the facts,allowing people to decide for themselves how they want to interpret the news and America loves them for it.  The liberals hate Fox news.   Fox actually investigates and reports on what happened; not what the liberals wished would have happened.  They show the liberals for what they are, full of $%$^.  They hated it when Fox repeatedly showed then President Clinton walking in a funeral procession laughing it up, that is until he saw a TV camera and started shedding crocodile tears.  Fox news made the general public aware that the budget successes of the 90's was due mostly to Newt Gingrich.  Clinton had a disastrous first 2 years of his presidency.  Gingrich's congress would not send Clinton the pork barrel projects so he couldn't spend to excess.  I wish we had Gingrich leading the congress doing the same to President Bush.  I am sure Rupert Murdoch is feeling "Outfoxed"; right now his network is ranked numero Uno as it has been for some time.  This DVD is hovering between 2000 and 3000.  I am ranked higher than it is. 
 Excellent book.  A simple and proven plan to a financially stable future 
 I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case. 
 This is the worst poem ever written. I was writting beter poetry when I was three!! Don't buy this "book" (It's long enough to be called one) it is the worst investment ever 
 Sally Melville is my hero.  A nice Armenian lady at my local "big box" craft store taught me to knit and pearl, but for my first year as a knitter, Sally taught me almost everything else, through "The Knit Stitch" and later "The Purl Stitch".  No, I wasn't crazy about every patterns, but I could find something I liked in almost every chapter of her books.    I had never seen such clear instructions and diagrams/photos in a learn-to-knit book.  Sally's way of addressing the new knitter's frustrations is full of humor & empathy, and there were times that I thought she was psychic, the way she anticipated the kinds of headaches I'd encounter with a new technique, or where I'd get confused.  I think Sally Melville really could be an important influence on the next generation of knitters, but maybe not under the continuing auspices of XRX.  That's the publisher - you may know them as the folks behind Knitter's Magazine, lately excorated in various knitting circles for their pattern styles.  I agree with the criticisms; you might not.  But if you don't love "Knitters", you are not going to love the patterns in "Book 3:  Color".  For my tastes, it isn't *just* that they're 1980s retro - Vogue Knitting does retro all the time, sometimes to gorgeous effect - with updated details and fresh vision.  Unfortunately, what others have pulled off doing retro, Ms. Melville in my opinion does not.    The fish sweater is not adorable.  Not unless you size it down for a six year old.  Mrs. Doubtfire would reject the fairisle suit that "isn't" named for her as dull and - bizarrely - near monochromatic!   (I think that other reviewers have mentioned this - considering the title, you'd expect a little more unrestrained celebration of color than we see in this book!)  "Little squares" should be called "Bix Boxy" (as in giving the impression of huge shoulders and unnaturally shortened upper arms - don't even thing Alexis Carrington would have gone for that one) - and "Nod to Mod", while possessing a sort of impressionist beauty with its inspired use of variagated yarn, looks better suited for quilting or wall art than the top presented. Red, white, and black "squiggle intarsia" harkens back to Classic Elite patterns circa 1990, and I just don't know what to make of Ms. Melville's insistance on alternating loop-and-button closures - so that the first button is on the right, 2nd on the left, etc.) in virtually every garment with buttons.  True, you can't please everybody - but as a vaguely fashion conscious 40something knitter, I don't think it's too cutting edge to suggest that Ms. Melville and her editors/advisors should have taken a look at what is turning up on the pages of was turning up on knitting websites, in Vogue (knitting or the fashion mag), Interweave Knits - or even in the local Target ads, when they started choosing projects back around - 2004? Not that what was current then wouldn't date somewhat over the course of book production, but you'd think a knitting writer of Melville's caliber might have been prescient enough to realize early on that the world wouldn't need one more shaggy dog's-breakfast-of-10-novelty-yarns poncho.  What *is* fairly wearable to my eyes among these patterns (example: the "Skinny Stripes" pullover) lacks personality - it's knitwear you could find in any corner Gap, or any Leisure Arts pattern display, in the case of the Log Cabin quilt.     As for the controversy over assymetry, I'd refer the curious to Teva Durham's "Loop-de-Loop" - the book has as many detractors as fans, but it does showcase excellent examples of assymetry done so as to look, well, deliberate.  Please don't just misbutton my coat and tell me it's fashion!  I hope that this incomparable teacher one day has her series redone under the guidance/advise of someone attuned to current fashion and detailing.  There's so much clarity and wisdom in "The Knitting Experience Book 3: Color", and the author just isn't getting the pattern support that could make her work a classic in the knitting genre 
 As a Starbucks employee of almost 2 years at my college... I know how to brew espresso and properly make drinks.  My roommates got this for me as a Christmas present at the Field Days Sale so I could make coffee drinks for all of our late night study sessions.  After about 2 months of use... the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead.  I contacted a service advisor at Krups' website and it turns out that I would have to ship the machine to the nearest service center in Illinois on my own dime.  No thank you!  I'll find something better 
 "Hedda Gabler" has to be one of the most boring plays I have ever read.  If you're looking for action in a play, then stay away from this one.  Henrik Ibsen's "A Doll House" was mesmerizing and captivating, and this play is the exact opposite.  There was no point to the plot and the ending served no purpose.  Hedda was bored - that's the point; just shameful.  I do not recommend 
 Having read a few of Anne Tyler's books in the past, I was looking forward to reading her latest novel.  At best, I found the book to be wholly forgettable.  At worst, I found her bottom line premises, upon which the book is based, without much merit.  I say so with some personal insight.  I was born in America in 1944, the first in my family to be a native born American.  And yes, my parents spoke a "foreign" language at home, among themselves and with their friends and relatives.  I was schooled in the local public schools, and interacted with youngsters who came from all sorts of backgrounds.  This remained true as I went on to college, and then graduate school.  My family did not feel like it was outside of the American mainstream because they had their roots in Europe.  To the contrary, they felt blessed to be here, and never missed an opportunity to praise America and all it stood for.  While our parents spoke a concocted language to us (we called it Germglish), we fully understood their native tongue, while we (the children) only conversed in English (to them as well as to others). Our experience was not unique;  infact, most of the people we met came from similar homes and backgrounds.  Now, perhaps growing up in New York City is different from living in the Baltimore suburbs, but I don't really think so.  I think that the greatest thing about this country lies in the fact that ALL of us came from somewhere, either recently or once upon a time.  And while we may choose to interact with people who share similar backgrounds, I really can't imagine that most of us are embarassed that we are not the American stereotype...white, protestant, having ancestors who came over on the Mayflower.  For this reason, more than any other, I found the book to be based on faulty premises, and when the central feature of a book doesn't ring true, the whole book ends up being less than fulfilling. 
 To be fair to the editor, women are doing many things in their 30s, so it's probably difficult to turn this topic into a cohesive book. Having said that, this book was disappointing. Some of the women have interesting stories to tell, no doubt about it (example: one of the authors is the granddaughter of the Rosenbergs, executed for treason) but with most of essays, it isn't clear what the heck the stories have to do with being in your 30s ... similar essays could have been written in 20s or 40s, or even other decades. I got the feeling these were interesting authors who were struggling to adapt pre-existing work or themes into the "30s" theme. There were a few standouts in this book, but overall I thought the writing was uneven. If you are interested in books regarding being single in your 30s, and children and whether to have them, etc., I strongly recommend "Maybe Baby", an anthology of essays by writers which is much better written 
 Leland's basic thesis that hip comes from the fusion of black and white cultures, and especially "his" big idea about the white boy who stole the blues is a flat-out rip-off of some major texts in American studies, especially Eric Lott's _Love and Theft_.  Leland misidentifies Lott as a "sociologist" and footnotes him only in relation to something else.  This is just bad.  Overall, the book is glib and shallow the way you might expect a book by a former editor at _Details_ to be: even though Thoreau is listed as one of hip's forebears (Leland calls the American Renaissance men the "o.g.'s," for original gangstas--get it?  it's, like, from rap!), the book blithely claims hip has always been about buying stuff.  I think not.  But I can see Leland pitching this book to the suits at HarperCollins: "See, the book is HIP.  Instead of acknowledgments, it's got 'Shout-outs,' see?  That's from rap.  I may be 45 but I can Talk to the Young, a Target Market!"  Look, if you read Details, knock yourself out, buy the book.  But if you're still a college student, take an American Studies course.  And if you're out of school and can actually read, read Lott.  Read Dick Hebdige.  Read Sarah Thornton.  (DEFINITELY read Sarah Thornton.)  But if you can't read, or are in high school and want to know what names to drop at whatever Williamsburg party your older brother lets you come to, well, whatever.  You might want to check it out of the library.  
 Overall it is a fairly good album.  Marques Houston has grown into a fine young man.  I am just as old as Marques Houston so I can remember his Immature days.  In my opinion, there are very few songs that are worth being listened to over and over and some that are not.  The tracks that I like are as follows:  1-All because of You 2-Sex Wit You 3-Marriage 5-Naked 6-Do You Mind 11-Everything  
 STRICTLY FOR DIE-HARD FANS ONLY.  THE EARLY "JERRY LEWIS" WORK GETS ON MY NERVES, HIS TALENT IMPROVED TOWARDS THE MID 1950s IN HIS FILMS WHEN HE CREATED A CHARACTER THAT EVOKES SYMPATHY AND LIKEABILITY.  BUT HIS EARLY WORK IS TOO MAD, THAT NASAL VOICE HE USED TO ADOPT IS SOOO IRRITATING.  FOR LEWIS GENIUS, BUY "THE DISORDERLY ORDERLY" "ARTISTS AND MODELS" - BETTER CHOICE THAN THESE TV APPEARANCES ON "COLGATE COMEDY HOUR". THE SHOW CHOICES WERE SO RANDOM TOO.  2 STARS ONL 
 No explanation is given as to how forms and entire environments can exist without spatial dimensions, nor why there can be a sequence of events and yet no such thing as time.  Author thinks astral projection is projecting into dreams 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 The foot bath makes a mess with the water and does not keep the water warm.  A lot more hassel than it is worth.  Sorry I spent my money on it 
 Taking an intro class into biochem I found this book very hard to follow very vague and basically lots of big words were used to confuse me the reader. I hate this book with a passion and feel that lehninger accompanied by any biochem review book is worth your money if this is required in your course tell your proff about lehninger the gold standard of biochemistry.   LEHNINGER is the only way biochem should be taught.  THIS BOOK SUCKS 
 When I bought this I was looking forward to the blending of the flute and the harp. I have Wind Songs and some Hilary Stagg and other harp music  in my collection. This CD dissapointed me. The flute is much louder than the harp and when I turned up the volume to hear the harp the flute became too shrill for my ears. My second letdown is that there is no passion or emotion in the performance. It sounds like some musicians playing sheet music for money. The musicians are very good technically, but they are performing music that they did not choose or compose and their lack of emotional commitment seems evident. Michael Hoppe wrote the music but he does not perform on any of the songs. The liner notes say that this is music to play in the background while having diner. Maybe that is what it is intended for, it's just not what I was looking for 
 First of all, Dr. Blackmore is a psychologist.  Psychologists have a very limited knowledge of the brain and how it works, compared to physicians like Dr. Moody, or especially neurologists, like Dr. Morse.  Secondly, other books on the subject were published by non-biased companies.  This was published by the materialistic-biased Prometheus Books, so the buck stops there.  Finally, this book is grossly out of date, since more reseach has suggested these experiences are indeed real.  It's an intelligent book, but it's still wrong 
 To see my point read Edgar C. Whisenant's "Why The Rapture will be in 1988"  HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!     Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises.  This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old "The sky is falling", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times.  For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in "the last times." He "knows" this because he sees so many antichrists around.  1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the "last times. 1 Peter 4:7 "The end of all things is at hand." James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon.     Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called "End Time Signs" did NOT apply?  The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough?  One of the signs of the "mark of the beast" started in 1948.  The Doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the Social Security Number system.  Recently, someone "set a bad precedent" by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip (In the wayward animal of course)     It seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the Chicken Littles has been making excuses ever since it all began.    2 Peter 3:4 "Where is the promise of his coming?" The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years."  Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.  Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, "Behold, I come quickly.  Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!      
 I usually would briefly summarize the plot in my reviews, but there really isn't one to write about.  It feels like a "days of our lives" soap opera of Betsy's life...she and eric are in love, she and eric have a fight, then she and eric make up, re-wash and rinse.  I wouldn't mind this as much except Betsy is getting more annoying with each book.  I keep waiting for her to grow up and be more queenly.  Her though process is like a 13 year old, and I just want to shake her and tell her to grow up.  I feel like the author is making Betsy more immature so that she can put Betsy in sillier situations (that anyone with a brain can figure out in 2 minutes) to get a cheap laugh from the readers.  This is one book in the series that you can skip without loosing anything.  To be honest, I truly think Betsy's demon sister is a better character to read about.  Maybe the author could do that after Betsy's story fizzles out...like the next book.      
 It's good to know how an editor think about the scientific writing, but practically the book is not helpful if you want to learn writing rather than editing. The author has never written scientific papers by himself. He has no idea how to orgnize the data and make a convincing story.   I have read many beautiful scientific papers in prestigeous journals. How come those authors have not written a book??  Also Day's book is too old. Now day nobody would like to draw graphs if there is software available. 
 Some talented DVD editor should take the latest 3 movies, and cut out the dumb scenes (about 75% of each movie) and put them all together to make one decent movie 
 I gave the record two stars because the guitar playing is decent. Other than that this thing doesn't have much going for it. The songs all sound similar and no effort was put into creating decent lyrics. If Soma were music, there's a good chance it would sound very similar to this album
